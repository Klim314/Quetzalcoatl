TI  == antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum.
AB  == objective: sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. it is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) and beta-carotene. this study was undertaken  to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum against selected gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. materials and methods: the ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. the obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: gram-negative bacteria (salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, acinetobacter sp, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumonia) and gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus). the activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). results: the methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against s. typhi, s. epidermidis, c. freundii and k. pneumonia. the results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. moreover, the result indicates  the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. conclusions: the study  suggests that the ovary extract of d. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == recent trends in control methods for bacterial wilt diseases caused by ralstonia  solanacearum.
AB  == previous studies have described the development of control methods against bacterial wilt diseases caused by ralstonia solanacearum. this review focused on  recent advances in control measures, such as biological, physical, chemical, cultural, and integral measures, as well as biocontrol efficacy and suppression mechanisms. biological control agents (bcas) have been dominated by bacteria (90%) and fungi (10%). avirulent strains of r. solanacearum, pseudomonas spp., bacillus spp., and streptomyces spp. are well-known bcas. new or uncommon bcas have also been identified such as acinetobacter sp., burkholderia sp., and paenibacillus sp. inoculation methods for bcas affect biocontrol efficacy, such as pouring or drenching soil, dipping of roots, and seed coatings. the amendment  of different organic matter, such as plant residue, animal waste, and simple organic compounds, have frequently been reported to suppress bacterial wilt diseases. the combined application of bcas and their substrates was shown to more effectively suppress bacterial wilt in the tomato. suppression mechanisms are typically attributed to the antibacterial metabolites produced by bcas or those present in natural products; however, the number of studies related to host resistance to the pathogen is increasing. enhanced/modified soil microbial communities are also indirectly involved in disease suppression. new promising types of control measures include biological soil disinfection using substrates that release volatile compounds. this review described recent advances in different control measures. we focused on the importance of integrated pest management (ipm) for bacterial wilt diseases.

TI  == bacterial rhizosphere and endosphere populations associated with grasses and trees to be used for phytoremediation of crude oil contaminated soil.
AB  == different grasses and trees were tested for their growth in a crude oil contaminated soil. three grasses, lolium perenne, leptochloa fusca, brachiaria mutica, and two trees, lecucaena leucocephala and acacia ampliceps, were selected to investigate the diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria. we found a higher number of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria associated with grasses than trees and that the endophytic bacteria were taxonomically different from rhizosphere associated bacteria showing their spatial distribution with reference to plant compartment as well as genotype. the rhizospheric soil yielded 22 (59.45 %), root interior yielded 9 (24.32 %) and shoot interior yielded 6 (16.21 %) hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. these bacteria possessed genes encoding alkane hydroxylase and showed multiple plant growth-promoting activities. bacillus (48.64 %) and acinetobacter (18.91 %) were dominant genera found in this study. at 2 % crude oil concentration, all bacterial isolates exhibited 25 %-78 % oil degradation and acinetobacter sp. strain brsi56 degraded  maximum. our study suggests that for practical application, support of potential  bacteria combined with the grasses is more effective approach than trees to remediate oil contaminated soils.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the mooi river, north west province, south africa.
AB  == groundwater in the mooi river catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. in this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. bacterial isolates were identified by 16s rrna sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (hpc)  bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (arb)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (escherichia coli). antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. hpc bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units  (cfu)/ml. e. coli were enumerated from trimpark, school and cemetery. the blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. opportunistic pathogens isolated included pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, alcaligenes, flavobacterium, bacillus cereus and mycobacterium spp. varying patterns of antibiotic resistance  were observed. most hpc bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant arb. other arbs included alcaligenes  faecalis, ochrobactrum sp. and achromobacter sp. arbs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to hpcs.  the presence of e. coli and arb in these groundwater sources indicates potential  human health risks. these risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.

TI  == antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, eupenicillium sp.  lg41.
AB  == two new compounds containing the decalin moiety, eupenicinicols a and b (1 and 2), two new sirenin derivatives, eupenicisirenins a and b (3 and 4), and four known compounds, (2s)-butylitaconic acid (5), (2s)-hexylitaconic acid (6), xanthomegnin (7), and viridicatumtoxin (8), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, eupenicillium sp. lg41, harbored in the roots of the chinese medicinal plant xanthium sibiricum. their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (nmr and hrms(n)), and their absolute configurations were  deduced by ecd calculations or optical rotation data. since the endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots, the antibacterial efficacies of the compounds 1-6 were investigated against bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter sp. bd4, which typically inhabit soil, as well as the clinically important staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. (2s)-butylitaconic acid (5) and (2s)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. compound 2 was  highly active against the clinically relevant s. aureus. by comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at c-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. our study reveals plausible ecological roles of  the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.

TI  == microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  == high-pressure processing (300 mpa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. high-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and enterobacteriaceae count. molecular characterization studies revealed that enterobacter amnigenus and enterobacter sp. in control and bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus gallinarum and acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.

TI  == penialidins a-c with strong antibacterial activities from penicillium sp., an endophytic fungus harboring leaves of garcinia nobilis.
AB  == three new polyketides named penialidins a-c (1-3), along with one known compound, citromycetin (4), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, penicillium sp., harbored in the leaves of the cameroonian medicinal plant garcinia nobilis. their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods (nmr and hrms(n)). the antibacterial efficacies of the new compounds (1-3) were tested against the clinically-important risk group 2 (rg2) bacterial strains of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the ecologically imposing strains of  e. coli (rg1), bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter sp. bd4 were also included in  the assay. compound 3 exhibited pronounced activity against the clinically-relevant s. aureus as well as against b. subtilis comparable to that of the reference standard (streptomycin). compound 2 was also highly-active against s. aureus. by comparing the structures of the three new compounds (1-3),  it was revealed that altering the substitutions at c-10 and c-2 can significantly increase the antibacterial activity of 1.

TI  == acinetobacter apis sp. nov., isolated from the intestinal tract of a honey bee, apis mellifera.
AB  == a novel gram-negative, obligate aerobic, non-motile, and both coccobacillus- and  bacillus-shaped bacterium, designated strain hyn18(t), was isolated from the intestinal tract of a honey bee (apis mellifera). the isolate was oxidase-negative and catalase-positive. strain hyn18(t) showed optimum growth at  25 degrees c, ph 6-7, and in the presence of 1% (w/v) nacl in trypticase soy broth medium. the isolate was negative for hydrolyses of starch, casein, gelatin  and urea, indole production from tryptone and hemolysis on sheep blood agar. a phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene and rpob gene sequence showed that strain hyn18(t) was most closely related to acinetobacter nectaris sap 763.2(t) and a. boissieri sap 284.1(t) with 98.3% and 98.1% similarity (16s rrna  gene), respectively, and 84.4% similarity with acinetobacter nectaris sap 763.2(t) (rpob gene). the major cellular fatty acids were summed features 3 (comprising c16:1omega7c /c16:1omega6c ), c12:0 and c16:0. the main isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-9 (q-9). the polar lipids of strain hyn18(t) were phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified lipids, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified glycolipid. the dna g+c content was 40.6 mol%. dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated less than 33 +/- 10% relatedness to the closest phylogenetic species, acinetobacter nectaris sap 763.2(t). thus, the phenotypic, phylogenetic and genotypic analyses indicate that strain hyn18(t) is  a novel species within the genus acinetobacter, for which the name acinetobacter  apis is proposed. the type strain is hyn18(t) (=kacc 16906(t) =jcm 18575(t)).

TI  == x-ray structure of a novel l-ribose isomerase acting on a non-natural sugar l-ribose as its ideal substrate.
AB  == l-ribose, a pentose, is not known to exist in nature. although organisms typically do not have a metabolic pathway that uses l-ribose as a carbon source,  prokaryotes use various sugars as carbon sources for survival. acinetobacter sp.  dl-28 has been shown to express the novel enzyme, l-ribose isomerase (acl-rbi), which catalyzes reversible isomerization between l-ribose and l-ribulose. acl-rbi showed the highest activity to l-ribose, followed by d-lyxose with 47% activity,  and had no significant amino acid sequence similarity to structure-known proteins, except for weak homology with the d-lyxose isomerases from escherichia  coli o157 : h7 (18%) and bacillus subtilis strain (19%). thus, acl-rbi is expected to have the unique three-dimensional structure to recognize l-ribose as  its ideal substrate. the x-ray structures of acl-rbi in complexes with substrates were determined. acl-rbi had a cupin-type beta-barrel structure, and the catalytic site was found between two large beta-sheets with a bound metal ion. the catalytic site structures clearly showed that acl-rbi adopted a cis-enediol intermediate mechanism for the isomerization reaction using two glutamate residues (glu113 and glu204) as acid/base catalysts. in its crystal form, acl-rbi formed a unique homotetramer with many substrate sub-binding sites, which likely  facilitated capture of the substrate. database: the atomic coordinates and structure factors of acl-rbi/l-ribose, acl-rbi/l-ribulose, acl-rbi/ribitol, e204q/l-ribose and e204q/l-ribulose have been deposited in the protein data bank  under accession codes, 4q0p, 4q0q, 4q0s, 4q0u and 4q0v.

TI  == screening of plant growth-promoting traits in arsenic-resistant bacteria isolated from agricultural soil and their potential implication for arsenic bioremediation.
AB  == twelve arsenic (as)-resistant bacteria (minimum inhibitory concentration ranging  from 10 to 30mm and 150 to 320mm for as(iii) and as(v), respectively) were isolated from the agricultural soil of the chianan plain in southwestern taiwan using enrichment techniques. eight isolates capable of oxidizing as(iii) (rate of oxidation from 0.029 to 0.059mumh(-1) 10(-9) cell) and exhibiting as(iii)-oxidase enzyme activity belong to pseudomonas, acinetobacter, klebsiella and comamonas genera, whereas four isolates that did not show as(iii)-oxidizing activity belong to geobacillus, bacillus, paenibacillus, and enterobacter genera. assessment of the parameters of plant growth promotion revealed that pseudomonas sp. asr1, asr2 and asr3, geobacillus sp. asr4, bacillus sp. asr5, paenibacillus sp. asr6, enterobacter sp. asr10 and comamonas sp. asr11, and asr12 possessed some or all of the studied plant growth-promoting traits, including phosphate-solubilization, siderophore, iaa-like molecules and acc deaminase production. in addition, the ability of as-resistant isolates to grow over wide ranges of ph and temperatures  signify their potential application for sustainable bioremediation of as in the environment.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolated from the internal organs of edible snow crabs.
AB  == antibiotic resistance and microbiota within edible snow crabs are important for the chionoecetes (snow crab) fishing industry. we investigated these parameters using culture methods and antibiotic susceptibility tests with six internal organs from three species of chionoecetes. each sample revealed many unexpected microbial species within chionoecetes internal organs. on the basis of 16s rrna sequence analysis of 381 isolates, the most abundant genera identified in chionoecetes opilio were acinetobacter spp. (24%), bacillus spp. (4%), pseudomonas spp. (34%), stenotrophomonas spp. (28%), and agreia spp. (11%). in chionoecetes sp. crabs, acinetobacter spp. (23%), bacillus spp. (12%), and psychrobacter spp. (20%) were most prevalent, while agreia spp. (11%), bacillus spp. (31%), microbacterium spp. (10%), rhodococcus spp. (12%), and agrococcus spp. (6%) were most abundant in c. japonicus. our antibiotic resistance test found resistance to all nine antibiotics tested in 19, 14, and two of the isolates from c. opilio, chionoecetes sp., and, c. japonicus respectively. our results are the first to show that microbes with antibiotic resistance are widely distributed throughout the internal organs of natural snow crabs.

TI  == composition diversity and nutrition conditions for accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) in a bacterial community from activated sludge.
AB  == we investigated the effect of chemical oxygen demand (cod)/n ratio on polyhydroxybutyrate (phb) accumulating ability in an anaerobic/aerobic cycle sequential batch reactor (sbr). compared the cod/n ratio of 10, 20, 50, and 125,  the cod/n of 125 was the most suitable nutritional proportion. when cod was 1,200 mg/l and cod/n/p was 1,200/9.6/30, activated sludge phb synthesis reached a maximum of 64.2 % of the dry weight of the cells. the population of the activated sludge was detected periodically by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant strains belonged to five genera: bacteroidetes sp., acinetobacter sp., betaproteobacteria sp., gammaproteobacteria sp., arcobacter sp., and bacillus sp. pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene indicated that the phb synthesis community was more diverse than that was detected by dgge, specifically acidobacteria (12.25 %), alphaproteobacteria (10.78 %), actinomycetales (9.68 %), actinobacteria (5.15 %), proteobacteria (4.04 %), and unclassified bacteria (24.14 %).

TI  == quorum quenching in culturable phyllosphere bacteria from tobacco.
AB  == many gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria employ a n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl)-based quorum sensing (qs) system to regulate their virulence traits. a sustainable biocontrol strategy has been developed using quorum quenching (qq) bacteria to interfere with qs and protect plants from pathogens. here, the prevalence and the diversity of qq strains inhabiting tobacco leaf surfaces were  explored. a total of 1177 leaf-associated isolates were screened for their ability to disrupt ahl-mediated qs, using the biosensor chromobacterium violaceum cv026. one hundred and sixty-eight strains (14%) are capable of interfering with  ahl activity. among these, 106 strains (63%) of the culturable quenchers can enzymatically degrade ahl molecules, while the remaining strains might use other  qs inhibitors to interrupt the chemical communication. moreover, almost 79% of the qq strains capable of inactivating ahls enzymatically have lactonase activity. further phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rdna revealed that the leaf-associated qq bacteria can be classified as bacillus sp., acinetobacter sp., lysinibacillus sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas sp., and myroides sp. the naturally occurring diversity of bacterial quenchers might provide opportunities to use them as effective biocontrol reagents for suppressing plant pathogen in situ.

TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == native soil bacteria isolates in mexico exhibit a promising antagonistic effect against fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici.
AB  == sinaloa state accounts for 23% of mexico's tomato production. one constraint on this important crop is the fusarium crown and root rot, caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, which has been reported to reduce crop yield by up to 50%. in this study, we set out to identify bacterial populations which could be used to control this disease through natural antagonism. five tomato rhizospheric soil samples were collected, dried for 1-week, and homogenized. sub-samples were used to prepare an aqueous solution used to isolate microorganisms in pure cultures. organisms were purified and grown separately, and used to generate a collection of 705 bacterial isolates. thirty-four percent  from this bank (254 strains) was screened against forl, finding 27 bacteria displaying in vitro forl growth inhibition levels from 5% to 60%. these isolates  belonged to the genus bacillus and their 16sr dna sequences showed that they are  closely related to seven species and they were putatively designated as: b. subtilis, b. cereus, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. licheniformis, b. thuringiensis, b. megaterium, and b. pumilus. one isolate belonged to the genus acinetobacter. two  b. subtilis isolates (144 and 151) and one b. cereus isolate (171) showed the best antagonistic potential against fcrrt when evaluated on seedlings. plate and  activity assays indicate that these isolates include a diverse repertoire of functional antagonistic traits that might explain their ability to control fcrrt. moreover, bacteria showed partial hemolytic activity, and future research will be directed at ensuring that their application will be not harmful for humans and effective against forl in greenhouse or field conditions.

TI  == the effect of temperature on antibacterial activity of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles.
AB  == the purpose of this study was the evaluation of two different temperatures on antibacterial activity of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles. 38 silver nanoparticles-producing bacteria were isolated from soil and identified. biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by these bacteria was verified through visible light spectrophotometry. two strains were relatively active for production of silver nanoparticles. these strains were subjected for molecular identification and recognized as bacillus sp. and acinetobacter schindleri. in the present study, the effect of temperatures was evaluated on structure and antimicrobial properties of the silver nanoparrticles by transmission electron microscopy (tem), x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis and antimicrobial agar well diffusion methods. the silver nanoparticles showed antibacterial activity against all the pathogenic bacteria; however, this property was lost after treatment of the silver nanoparticles by high temperatures (100 and 300 degrees c). tem images showed that the average sizes of heated silver nanoparticles were >100 nm. however, these were <100 nm for non-heated silver nanoparticles. although, xrd patterns showed the crystalline structure of heated silver nanoparticles, their antibacterial activities were less. this was possible because of the sizes and accordingly less penetration of the particles into the bacterial cells. in addition, elimination of the capping agents by heat might be considered another reason.

AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == high level multiple antibiotic resistance among fish surface associated bacterial populations in non-aquaculture freshwater environment.
AB  == freshwater fish, alburnus alburnus (bleak), were captured from lake mogan, situated in ankara, during spring. the surface mucus of the fish was collected and associated bacteria were cultured and isolated. by sequencing pcr-amplified 16s rna encoding genes, the isolates were identified as members of 12 different genera: acinetobacter, aeromonas, bacillus, brevundimonas, gordonia, kocuria, microbacterium, mycobacterium, pseudomonas, rhodococcus, and staphylococcus, in addition to one strain that was unidentified. the mucus-dwelling bacterial isolates were tested for resistance against ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin and chloramphenicol. about 95% of the isolates were found to be resistant to ampicillin, 93% to chloramphenicol, and 88% to kanamycin and streptomycin. a microbacterium oxydans and the unidentified environmental isolate were resistant  to all four antibiotics tested at very high levels (>1600 mug/ml ampicillin and streptomycin; >1120 mug/ml kanamycin; >960 mug/ml chloramphenicol). only a kocuria sp. was sensitive to all four antibiotics at the lowest concentrations tested (3.10 mug/ml ampicillin and streptomycin; 2.15 mug/ml kanamycin; 1.85 mug/ml chloramphenicol). the rest of the isolates showed different resistance levels. plasmid isolations were carried out to determine if the multiple antibiotic resistance could be attributed to the presence of plasmids. however, no plasmid was detected in any of the isolates. the resistance appeared to be mediated by chromosome-associated functions. this study indicated that multiple antibiotic resistance at moderate to high levels is common among the current phenotypes of the fish mucus-dwelling bacterial populations in this temperate, shallow lake which has not been subjected to any aquaculturing so far but under anthropogenic effect being in a recreational area.

TI  == bacteria in crude oil survived autoclaving and stimulated differentially by exogenous bacteria.
AB  == autoclaving of crude oil is often used to evaluate the hydrocarbon-degrading abilities of bacteria. this may be potentially useful for bioaugmentation and microbial enhanced oil recovery (meor). however, it is not entirely clear if "endogenous" bacteria (e.g., spores) in/on crude oil survive the autoclaving process, or influence subsequent evaluation of the hydrocarbon-degradation abilities of the "exogenous" bacterial strains. to test this, we inoculated autoclaved crude oil medium with six exogenous bacterial strains (three dietzia strains, two acinetobacter strains, and one pseudomonas strain). the survival of  the spore-forming bacillus and paenibacillus and the non-spore-forming mesophilic pseudomonas, dietzia, alcaligenes, and microbacterium was detected using a 16s rrna gene clone library and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis. however, neither bacteria nor bacterial activity was detected  in three controls consisting of non-inoculated autoclaved crude oil medium. these results suggest that detection of endogenous bacteria was stimulated by the six inoculated strains. in addition, inoculation with acinetobacter spp. stimulated detection of bacillus, while inoculation with dietzia spp. and pseudomonas sp. stimulated the detection of more pseudomonas. in contrast, similar exogenous bacteria stimulated similar endogenous bacteria at the genus level. based on these results, special emphasis should be applied to evaluate the influence of bacteria capable of surviving autoclaving on the hydrocarbon-degrading abilities  of exogenous bacteria, in particular, with regard to bioaugmentation and meor. bioaugmentation and meor technologies could then be developed to more accurately  direct the growth of specific endogenous bacteria that may then improve the efficiency of treatment or recovery of crude oil.

TI  == study in vitro of the impact of endophytic bacteria isolated from centella asiatica on the disease incidence caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus colletotrichum higginsianum.
AB  == thirty-one endophytic bacteria isolated from healthy leaves of centella asiatica  were screened in vitro for their ability to reduce the growth rate and disease incidence of colletotrichum higginsianum, a causal agent of anthracnose. isolates of cohnella sp., paenibacillus sp. and pantoea sp. significantly stimulated the growth rate of c. higginsianum mucl 44942, while isolates of achromobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., microbacterium sp., klebsiella sp. and pseudomonas putida had  no influence on this plant pathogen. by contrast, bacillus subtilis bca31 and pseudomonas fluorescens bca08 caused a marked inhibition of c. higginsianum mucl  44942 growth by 46 and 82 %, respectively. cell-free culture filtrates of b. subtilis bca31 and p. fluorescens bca08 were found to contain antifungal compounds against c. higginsianum mucl 44942. inoculation assays on in vitro-cultured plants of c. asiatica showed that foliar application of b. subtilis bca31, three days before inoculation with c. higginsianum mucl 44942, significantly reduced incidence and severity of the disease. the role of endophytic bacteria in maintaining the apparent inactivity of c. higginsianum mucl 44942 in c. asiatica grown in the wild is discussed.

TI  == isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == air-dust-borne associations of phototrophic and hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms: promising consortia in volatile hydrocarbon bioremediation.
AB  == aquatic and terrestrial associations of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms active in hydrocarbon bioremediation have been described earlier.  the question arises: do similar consortia also occur in the atmosphere? dust samples at the height of 15 m were collected from kuwait city air, and analyzed microbiologically for phototrophic and heterotrophic hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms, which were subsequently characterized according to their 16s rrna gene sequences. the hydrocarbon utilization potential of the heterotrophs alone,  and in association with the phototrophic partners, was measured quantitatively. the chlorophyte gloeotila sp. and the two cyanobacteria nostoc commune and leptolyngbya thermalis were found associated with dust, and (for comparison) the  cynobacteria leptolyngbya sp. and acaryochloris sp. were isolated from coastal water. all phototrophic cultures harbored oil vapor-utilizing bacteria in the magnitude of 10(5) g(-1). each phototrophic culture had its unique oil-utilizing  bacteria; however, the bacterial composition in leptolyngbya cultures from air and water was similar. the hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria were affiliated with acinetobacter sp., aeromonas caviae, alcanivorax jadensis, bacillus asahii, bacillus pumilus, marinobacter aquaeolei, paenibacillus sp., and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the nonaxenic cultures, when used as inocula in batch cultures, attenuated crude oil in light and dark, and in the presence of antibiotics and absence of nitrogenous compounds. aqueous and diethyl ether extracts from the phototrophic cultures enhanced the growth of the pertinent oil-utilizing bacteria in batch cultures, with oil vapor as a sole carbon source. it was concluded that  the airborne microbial associations may be effective in bioremediating atmospheric hydrocarbon pollutants in situ. like the aquatic and terrestrial habitats, the atmosphere contains dust-borne associations of phototrophic and heterotrophic hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria that are active in hydrocarbon attenuation.

TI  == molecular identification of antagonistic bacteria from tehran soils and evaluation of their inhibitory activities toward pathogenic fungi.
AB  == background and objectives: to find antagonistic bacteria with potential antifungal activity against some pathogenic fungi, including aspergillus niger, a. flavus, fusarium moniliforme and penicillium marneffei, a total of 148 agricultural soil samples from different sites of tehran were examined. materials and methods: antagonistic soils were selected by screening against a. niger on glucose-yeast extract (gy) agar using a visual agar plate assay method. all growing bacteria were examined for antifungal activity, and antagonistic bacteria identified based on 16s rrna sequence analysis. among a total number of 97 bacteria isolated form inhibitory soils (36 samples), 16 bacteria were reported as strong growth inhibitors in co-cultures on gy agar with all tested fungi at variable degrees. fungal growth inhibitory bacteria were cultured against all fungi and growth inhibition was measured and analyzed between test and control groups by statistical analysis (anova). results: molecular identification of antagonistic bacteria indicated that most bacterial isolates belonged to the genus bacillus (81.25%), including b. subtilis (5 isolates), b. amyloliquefaciens (6 isolates) and b. valismortis (2 isolates), followed by one isolate (6.25%) from each streptomyces sp., pseudomonas chlororaphis and acinetobacter baumannii. based on the visual plate assay results, total fungal growth inhibition of all bacteria was reported in the range of 13.2 to 68.3%. p. chlororaphis s105 was reported as the most potent antagonistic bacterium which inhibited the growth of  a. niger by 68.3%, followed by f. moniliforme (66.4%), a. flavus (64.7%) and p. marneffei (57.1%). conclusion: p. chlororaphis and some other inhibitory bacteria reported in the present study, they may be considered not only as a rich source of useful metabolites with potential application in antifungal drug discovery, but also as potential candidates for biological control programs.

TI  == host plant induced variation in gut bacteria of helicoverpa armigera.
AB  == helicoverpa are important polyphagous agricultural insect pests and they have a worldwide distribution. in this study, we report the bacterial community structure in the midgut of fifth instar larvae of helicoverpa armigera, a species prevalent in the india, china, south asia, south east asia, southern & eastern africa and australia. using culturable techniques, we isolated and identified members of bacillus firmus, bacillus niabense, paenibacillus jamilae, cellulomonas variformis, acinetobacter schindleri, micrococcus yunnanesis, enterobacter sp., and enterococcus cassiliflavus in insect samples collected from host plants grown in different parts of india. besides these the presence of sphingomonas, ralstonia, delftia, paracoccus and bacteriodetes was determined by  culture independent molecular analysis. we found that enterobacter and enterococcus were universally present in all our helicoverpa samples collected from different crops and in different parts of india. the bacterial diversity varied greatly among insects that were from different host plants than those from the same host plant of different locations. this result suggested that the type of host plant greatly influences the midgut bacterial diversity of h. armigera, more than the location of the host plant. on further analyzing the leaf from which the larva was collected, it was found that the h. armigera midgut bacterial community was similar to that of the leaf phyllosphere. this finding indicates that the bacterial flora of the larval midgut is influenced by the leaf surface bacterial community of the crop on which it feeds. additionally, we found that laboratory made media or the artificial diet is a poor bacterial source for these insects compared to a natural diet of crop plant.

AB  == taking the cow dung and straw as composting raw materials, effect of cellulose-decomposing strain on microbial community of cow manure compost was investigated with the traditional culture method and pcr-dgge technique. the results showed that the microbiological inocula showed a more rapid rate of temperature elevation at the start of composting and prolonged the time of high-temperature process and increased the number of microbial. the dgge map of cellulose-decomposing strain compost was different from natural compost, the succession of microbial community in cellulose-decomposing strain was faster than natural compost. sequence comparison revealed that the pseudomonas sp. of bacterial appeared at the initial stage and acinetobacter sp., flavobacteria were existed at the high-temperature process in natural compost; while arthrobacter sp. was appeared at the high-temperature process in cellulose-decomposing strain  compost. bacillus sp. was dominant species at middle and later stage in natural compost and cellulose-decomposing strain compost. eimeriidae of fungal appeared in compost materials, aspergillus and thermophilic fungi were dominant species at the high-temperature process in natural compost and cellulose-decomposing strain  compost. ascomycota appeared at middle and later stage in natural compost; while  basidiomycetes in cellulose-decomposing strain compost. aspergillus was found throughout the process. this result suggested that the microbiological inocula were able to facilitate the bacterial microbial diversity of the compost; reduced the fungal microbial diversity of the compost. the aims of this study were to provide a scientific basis to the diversity of microbial community by monitoring  the dynamics of microbial community in cellulose-decomposing strain compost and represent an important step towards the understanding of microbiological inocula  and its function in the degradation process of compost.

TI  == could petroleum biodegradation be a joint achievement of aerobic and anaerobic microrganisms in deep sea reservoirs?
AB  == several studies suggest that petroleum biodegradation can be achieved by either aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms, depending on oxygen input or other electron  acceptors and appropriate nutrients. evidence from in vitro experiments with samples of petroleum formation water and oils from pampo field indicate that petroleum biodegradation is more likely to be a joint achievement of both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial consortium, refining our previous observations of aerobic degradation. the aerobic consortium depleted, in decreasing order, hydrocarbons > hopanes > steranes > tricyclic terpanes while the anaerobic consortium depleted hydrocarbons > steranes > hopanes > tricyclic terpanes. the oxygen content of the mixed consortia was measured from time to time revealing alternating periods of microaerobicity (o2 ~0.8 mg.l-1) and of aerobicity (o2~6.0 mg.l-1). in this experiment, the petroleum biodegradation changed from time to time, alternating periods of biodegradation similar to the aerobic process and periods of biodegradation similar to the anaerobic process. the consortia showed preferences for metabolizing hydrocarbons > hopanes > steranes > tricyclic terpanes during a  90-day period, after which this trend changed and steranes were more biodegraded  than hopanes. the analysis of aerobic oil degrading microbiota by the 16s rrna gene clone library detected the presence of bacillus, brevibacterium, mesorhizobium and achromobacter, and the analysis of the anaerobic oil degrading  microbiota using the same technique detected the presence of bacillus and acinetobacter (facultative strains). in the mixed consortia stenotrophomonas, brevibacterium, bacillus, rhizobium, achromobacter and 5% uncultured bacteria were detected. this is certainly a new contribution to the study of reservoir biodegradation processes, combining two of the more important accepted hypotheses.

(11 mm) while the benzene extracts of h. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and s. aureus (12 mm). conclusions: it is  hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.

TI  == [changes in the bacterial spectrum in severe burn wounds].
AB  == study objective: to determine the time axis for increase in gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. study type: retrospective. material and methods: eighty-five patients hospitalized at the clinic of burns and reconstructive surgery between 2006 and 2008 were enrolled in the study. the major criteria for enrolment were more than 15% of total body surface area (tbsa) burned, hospital stay of 1 month or more and age over 18 years. specimens for microbiological examination were collected on days 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20 after admission. results: a total of 777 bacterial strains were isolated from the study patients, with 64.6% of these strains being gram positive and 35.4% gram negative. the most frequently isolated gram positive pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (260 strains) and bacillus sp. (113 strains), while the most common gram negative pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (81 strains), escherichia coli (63 strains) and acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (57 strains). conclusion: the study provided data that supports the assumption of increase in gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. nevertheless, even on day 20 after admission, such strains did not predominate.

TI  == biodegradability of bacterial surfactants.
AB  == this work aimed at evaluating the biodegradability of different bacterial surfactants in liquid medium and in soil microcosms. the biodegradability of biosurfactants by pure and mixed bacterial cultures was evaluated through co(2) evolution. three bacterial strains, acinetobacter baumanni lbbma es11, acinetobacter haemolyticus lbbma 53 and pseudomonas sp. lbbma 101b, used the biosurfactants produced by bacillus sp. lbbma 111a (mixed lipopeptide), bacillus  subtilis lbbma 155 (lipopeptide), flavobacterium sp. lbbma 168 (mixture of flavolipids), dietzia maris lbbma 191(glycolipid) and arthrobacter oxydans lbbma  201(lipopeptide) as carbon sources in minimal medium. the synthetic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) was also mineralized by these microorganisms, but at a lower rate. co(2) emitted by a mixed bacterial culture in soil microcosms with  biosurfactants was higher than in the microcosm containing sds. biosurfactant mineralization in soil was confirmed by the increase in surface tension of the soil aqueous extracts after incubation with the mixed bacterial culture. it can be concluded that, in terms of biodegradability and environmental security, these compounds are more suitable for applications in remediation technologies in comparison to synthetic surfactants. however, more information is needed on structure of biosurfactants, their interaction with soil and contaminants and scale up and cost for biosurfactant production.

TI  == rational design of a plasmid origin that replicates efficiently in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: most plasmids replicate only within a particular genus or family. methodology/principal findings: here we describe an engineered high copy number expression vector, pbav1k-t5, that produces varying quantities of active reporter proteins in escherichia coli, acinetobacter baylyi adp1, agrobacterium tumefaciens, (all gram-negative), streptococcus pneumoniae, leifsonia shinshuensis, peanibacillus sp. s18-36 and bacillus subtilis (gram-positive). conclusions/significance: our results demonstrate the efficiency of pbav1k-t5 replication in different bacterial species, thereby facilitating the study of proteins that don't fold well in e. coli and pathogens not amenable to existing genetic tools.

TI  == phaseolus vulgaris seed-borne endophytic community with novel bacterial species such as rhizobium endophyticum sp. nov.
AB  == the bacterial endophytic community present in different phaseolus vulgaris (bean) cultivars was analyzed by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequences of cultured isolates derived from surface disinfected roots and immature seeds. isolated endophytes from tissue-macerates belonged to over 50 species in 24 different genera and some isolates from acinetobacter, bacillus, enterococcus, nocardioides, paracoccus, phyllobacterium, and sphingomonas seem to correspond to new lineages. phytate solubilizing bacteria were identified among acinetobacter, bacillus and streptomyces bean isolates, phytate is the most abundant reserve of phosphorus in bean and in other seeds. endophytic rhizobia were not capable of forming nodules. a novel rhizobial species rhizobium endophyticum was recognized on the basis of dna-dna hybridization, sequence of 16s rrna, reca, rpob, atpd, dnak genes, plasmid profiles, and phenotypic characteristics. r. endophyticum is capable of solubilizing phytate, the type strain is ccge2052 (atcc baa-2116; hambi 3153) that became fully symbiotic by acquiring the r. tropici cfn299 symbiotic plasmid.

TI  == microorganisms associated with maari, a baobab seed fermented product.
AB  == a microbiological study was carried out on baobab fermented seeds (maari) obtained from 4 different production sites in burkina faso (mansila, toulfe, ouagadougou and gorgadji). a total of 390 representative isolates comprising 251  aerobic mesophilic bacteria (amb) and 139 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated and identified to species level using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including conventional morphological analysis, carbohydrate fermentation profiling, rep-pcr ((gtg)(5)-fingerprinting) and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the fermentation of baobab seeds was initiated by the amb identified  as bacillus subtilis (82% of amb isolates) and staphylococcus sciuri (18% of amb  isolates). no lactic acid bacteria were isolated at the beginning of the process. after 24h fermentation time, enterococcus faecium appeared in the fermenting seeds and remained until the end of the fermentation, as the predominant lab. in  maari collected from retail outlets the amb count ranged from 6.7log10cfu/g to 10log10cfu/g while the lab load ranged from 4.4log10cfu/g to 9.9log10cfu/g. the amb were identified as belonging to genus bacillus (12 species), staphylococcus (3 species) and one species of aerococcus, macrococcus, leifsonia, kurthia, proteus, acinetobacter and globicatella, respectively. a putatively novel, previously undescribed corynebacterium sp. was also found. e. faecium was the dominant lab in all investigated retail samples except one sample dominated by pediococcus acidilactici.

TI  == isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from acinetobacter sp. bj-l.
AB  == strain bj-l was isolated from the a water sample taken from xiao yue river in beijing and identified as acinetobacter sp. bj-l based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16s rrna gene sequence. a new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees c for 72 h. the antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, etoac extract, and silica gel column chromatography. the structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (scd) by spectroscopic data interpretation. structure analysis indicated that scd is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the mic of 2mg/ml, such as staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterobacter aerogenes  and escherichia coli. moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured huvec cells with different concentrations of scd at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.

TI  == investigation of mineral water springs of miercurea ciuc (csikszereda) region (romania) with cultivation-dependent microbiological methods.
AB  == water samples of ten mineral water springs at miercurea ciuc (csikszereda) region (romania) were examined during 2005-2006 using cultivation-dependent microbiological methods. the results of standard hygienic bacteriological tests showed that the hargita spring had perfect and five other springs had microbiologically acceptable water quality (zsogod-, nagy-borviz-, taploca-, szentegyhaza- and lobogo springs). the water of borsaros spring was exceptionable (high germ count, presence of enterococcus spp.).both standard bacteriological and molecular microbiological methods indicated that the microbiological water quality of the szeltersz-, nadasszek- and delo springs was not acceptable. bad water quality resulted from inadequate spring catchment and hygiene (low yield, lack of runoff, negligent usage of the springs, horse manure around the spring).the 16s rrna gene-based identification of strains isolated on standard meat-peptone medium resulted in the detection of typical aquatic organisms such as shewanella baltica, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas veronii, psychrobacter sp,. acinetobacter spp. and allochthonous microbes, like nocardia, streptomyces, bacillus, microbacterium , and arthrobacter strains indicating the impact of soil. other allochthonous microbes, such as staphylococcus spp., micrococcus sp., lactococcus sp., clostridium butyricum, yersinia spp., aerococcus sp., may have originated from animal/human sources.

TI  == culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

TI  == biosurfactants, bioemulsifiers and exopolysaccharides from marine microorganisms.
AB  == marine biosphere offers wealthy flora and fauna, which represents a vast natural  resource of imperative functional commercial grade products. among the various bioactive compounds, biosurfactant (bs)/bioemulsifiers (be) are attracting major  interest and attention due to their structural and functional diversity. the versatile properties of surface active molecules find numerous applications in various industries. marine microorganisms such as acinetobacter, arthrobacter, pseudomonas, halomonas, myroides, corynebacteria, bacillus, alteromonas sp. have  been studied for production of bs/be and exopolysaccharides (eps). due to the enormity of marine biosphere, most of the marine microbial world remains unexplored. the discovery of potent bs/be producing marine microorganism would enhance the use of environmental biodegradable surface active molecule and hopefully reduce total dependence or number of new application oriented towards the chemical synthetic surfactant industry. our present review gives comprehensive information on bs/be which has been reported to be produced by marine microorganisms and their possible potential future applications.

TI  == aerobic granules with inhibitory strains and role of extracellular polymeric substances.
AB  == microorganisms compete with other species by secreting antimicrobial compounds. the compact structure of aerobic granules was generally assumed to provide spatial isolation, resulting in the co-occurrence of diverse strains that have similar or dissimilar functions. no studies have investigated whether stable, mature aerobic granules can be formed with two mutually inhibitory strains. the strain acinetobacter sp. i8 competes with bacillus sphaericus i5 in a well-mixed  environment, but can form stable and mature granules at 400 mg l(-1) phenol by repeatedly replenishing fresh medium in a sequencing batch reactor. the supernatants collected from the i8 medium in its exponential-growth phase or from the i5+i8 medium cultivated for 12 or 24h significantly inhibited i5 growth. addition of tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances (tbeps) or loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (lbeps) extracted from i5+i8 granules effectively suppressed the inhibitory effects of i8 on i5. the tbeps or lbeps physically separate strain i5 from i8 in the granule, and effectively adsorb the  inhibitory substance(s) in the suspension.

TI  == endophytic bacteria associated with growing shoot tips of banana (musa sp.) cv. grand naine and the affinity of endophytes to the host.
AB  == a cultivation-based assessment of endophytic bacteria present in deep-seated shoot tips of banana suckers was made with a view to generate information on the  associated organisms, potential endophytic contaminants in tissue-cultured bananas and to assess if the endophytes shared a beneficial relationship with the host. plating the tissue homogenate from the central core of suckers showed colony growth on nutrient agar from just 75% and 42% of the 12 stocks during may  and november, respectively (average 58%; 6 x 10(3) colony-forming units per gram), yielding diverse organisms belonging to firmicutes (bacillus, brevibacillus, paenibacillus, virgibacillus, staphylococcus spp.), actinobacteria (cellulomonas, micrococcus, corynebacterium, kocuria spp.), alpha-proteobacteria  (paracoccus sp.), and gamma-proteobacteria (pseudomonas, acinetobacter spp.). each shoot tip showed one to three different organisms and no specific organism appeared common to different sucker tips. tissue homogenate from shoot tips including the ones that did not yield culturable bacteria displayed abundant bacterial cells during microscopic examination suggesting that a high proportion  of cells were in viable-but-nonculturable state, or their cultivation requirements were not met. direct application of cultivation-independent approach to study endophytic bacterial community using bacterial 16s ribosomal rna universal primers resulted in high interference from chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences. dislodging the bacterial cells from shoot tips that did not show cultivable bacteria and incubating the tissue crush in dilute-nutrient broth led to the activation of four organisms (klebsiella, agrobacterium, pseudacidovorax spp., and an unidentified isolate). the endophytic organisms in general showed better growth at 30-37 degrees c compared with 25 degrees c, and the growth of endophytes as well as pathogenic erwinia carotovora  were promoted with the supply of host tissue extract (hte) while that of the isolates from nonplant sources were inhibited or unaffected by hte, suggesting an affinity or dependence of the endophytes on the host and the prospect of an hte-based assay for discriminating the nonendophytes from endophytes.

TI  == characterization of microbial community during asian dust events in korea.
AB  == an asian dust event, also sometimes known as a yellow sand event, is a seasonal meteorological phenomenon affecting east asia, typically in the early spring. because of the significant ecological and health effects of these events on east  asia, and the large amount of dust that is transported from the desert in china to korea and japan, these events have been receiving increased attention. it is likely that these storms often provide long-range transport to various microorganisms. however, despite a certain level of attention to the chemical analysis of these storms, microbiological studies of yellow sand dust have been scarce. we collected a total of 30 microbiological air samples using a pm(2.5) cyclone sampler in seoul, korea from april 2007 to march 2008. six of these samples were collected during yellow sand events, while 24 were from non-yellow sand events. chemical analysis was performed on the samples using a thermal-optical transmittance (tot) method. total nucleic acids were also extracted, and the 16s rdna was amplified by pcr and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dendrogram analysis, based on dgge, indicated that the microbial profiles from the yellow sand were distinctive from  those of the non-yellow sand samples. microorganisms identified in yellow sand samples included aquabacterium sp., flavobacteriales bacterium sp., prevotellaceae bacterium sp., and others, whereas microorganisms in non-yellow sand samples included propionibacterium sp., bacillus sp., acinetobacter sp., and others. these results suggest that, as a result of yellow sand events, humans in  the affected regions are exposed to communities of microorganisms that might cause various adverse health effects.

TI  == extremophile culture collection from andean lakes: extreme pristine environments  that host a wide diversity of microorganisms with tolerance to uv radiation.
AB  == a total of 88 bacterial strains were isolated from six andean lakes situated at altitudes ranging from 3,400 to 4,600 m above sea level: l. aparejos (4,200 m), l. negra (4,400 m), l. verde (4,460 m), l. azul (4,400 m), l. vilama (4,600 m), and salina grande (3,400 m). salinity ranged from 0.4 to 117 ppm. general diversity was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis. from the excised dgge bands, 182 bacterial sequences of good quality were obtained. gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga/flavobacterium/bacteroides (cfb) were the most abundant phylogenetic groups with 42% and 18% of identified bands,  respectively. the isolated strains were identified by sequence analysis. isolated bacteria were subjected to five different uv-b exposure times: 0.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. afterwards, growth of each isolate was monitored and resistance was classified according to the growth pattern. a wide interspecific variation among  the 88 isolates was observed. medium and highly resistant strains accounted for 43.2% and 28.4% of the isolates, respectively, and only 28.4% was sensitive. resistance to solar radiation was equally distributed among the isolates from the different lakes regardless of the salinity of the lakes and pigmentation of isolates. of the highly resistant isolates, 44.5% belonged to gammaproteobacteria, 33.3% to betaproteobacteria, 40% to alphaproteobacteria, 50% to cfb, and among gram-positive organisms, 33.3% were hgc and 44.5% were firmicutes. most resistant strains belonged to genera like exiguobaceterium sp.,  acinetobacter sp., bacillus sp., micrococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., sphyngomonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and stenotrophomonas sp. the current study provides further evidence that gammaproteobacteria are the most abundant and the most uv-b-resistant phylogenetic group in andean lakes and that uv resistance in bacteria isolated from these environments do not depend on pigmentation and tolerance to salinity.

AB  == the ability of non-flocculating acinetobacter spp. isolates (a. johnsonii s35 and a. junii s33) to coaggregate with other sludge-constituting bacteria obtained from a sewage sludge sample was assessed by a spectrophotometric assay. a. johnsonii s35 showed significant coaggregation (aggregation index (ai)=70 to 99%) with 7 strains, bacillus cereus, blastomonas natatoria, mycobacterium sp., thermomonas brevis, and enterobacteriaceae family, identified by sequencing of 16s rrna genes. a. junii s33 coaggregated with 4 strains, which were also coaggregating partners of a. johnsonii s35, as indicated by ai values of 59-93%.  the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon (math) assay showed that both a. johnsonii  s35 and a. junii s33 possess a hydrophobic character as indicated by their relative cell surface hydrophobicity (rcsh), 88 and 61%, respectively. a good correlation was observed between the degree of coaggregation of the acinetobacter spp. isolates and the rcsh of their partner strains. the cells of an a. johnsonii s35 spontaneous mutant and a. johnsonii iam1517, which had a hydrophilic cell surface, did not coaggregate with the other examined isolates. these results demonstrated that hydrophobic interaction plays an important role in the intergeneric coaggregation of acinetobacter spp. isolates with other sludge-constituting bacteria.

TI  == proteolytic activity in stored aerobic granular sludge and structural integrity.
AB  == aerobic granules lose stability during storage. the goal of this work was to highlight the main cause of stability loss for stored granules as intracellular protein hydrolysis. the quantity of extracellular proteins was noted to be significantly lower during granule storage, and protease enzyme activities were correspondingly higher in the cores of stored granules. the proteolytic bacteria, which secrete highly active protease enzymes, were for the first time isolated and characterized by analyzing 16s rdna sequences. the proteolytic bacteria belonged to the genera pseudomonas, raoultella, acinetobacter, pandoraea, klebsiella, bacillus and uncultured bacterium, and were grouped into proteobacteria, enterobacteria and firmicutes. the pb1 (pseudomonas aeruginosa) strain, which exhibited very high proteolytic activity during the skim milk agar  test, was located at the core regime with active protease enzymes, and was close  to the obligate anaerobic strain bacteroides sp. hence, the extracellular proteins in stored granules were proposed to be hydrolyzed by enzymes secreted by proteolytic bacteria with the hydrolyzed products ultimately being used by nearby anaerobic strains. this process gradually digests the protein core, and eventually consumes the entire granule.

AB  == the characterization of microbial communities of different depth sediment samples was examined by a culture-independent method and compared with physicochemical parameters, those are organic matter (om), total nitrogen (tn), total phosphorus  (tp), ph and redox potential (eh). total genomic dna was extracted from samples derived from different depths. after they were amplified with the gc-341f/907r primer sets of partial bacterial 16s rrna genes, the products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the profile of dgge fingerprints  of different depth sediment samples revealed that the community structure remained relatively stable along the entire 45 cm sediment core, however, principal-component analysis of dgge patterns revealed that at greater sediment depths, successional shifts in community structure were evident. the principle coordinates analysis suggested that the bacterial communities along the sediment  core could be separated into two groups, which were located 0--20 cm and 21--45 cm, respectively. the sequencing dominant bands demonstrated that the major phylogenetic groups identified by dgge belonged to bacillus, bacterium, brevibacillus, exiguobacterium, gamma-proteobacterium, acinetobacter sp. and some uncultured or unidentified bacteria. the results indicated the existence of highly diverse bacterial community in the lake sediment core.

AB  == diarrheal diseases with diarrhea are the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in children; however the causative agent cannot be identified always, which suggests the presence of unknown enteropathogens inducing diarrhea. the isolation of acinetobacter sp. from feces of children with acute diarrhea, unrelated to known enteropathogens motivated this investigation to detect a possible enterotoxigenic effect on ht-29 cells. the study population comprised 150 children with an age range from 0 to 5 years old; 120 were assisted in the "hospital materno infantil del este'' with gastrointestinal syndrome and 30 healthy controls who went to the center for routine analysis. in 25% of symptomatic patients were diagnosed parasites and bacteria, identified routinely. from four symptomatic patients were isolated three acinetobacter baumannii strains and two a. calcoaceticus strains. the strains were cultured in brain-heart infusion for 24 and 48 hrs, at 35 degrees c, and the supernatants were obtained by centrifugation and filtration and their activity tested on ht-29 cell monolayers. the supernatants of the three strains of a. baumannii induced alterations of the cell monolayer, showed by detachments of cell monolayers, cell segregation, cell rounding and swelling. these effects were more intense with the 48 h culture exoproducts of the 016 strain, which were higher than the positive control. this toxigenic effect of a. baumannii, could represent a pathogenic mechanism whose definition requires more studies to determine the possible role in the pathogenicity of this bacillus.

(strain mg) and a. calcoaceticus (strain m10) consumed 100 (cometabolic medium) and 82 mg/l (mineral medium) of oxygenate tame in 21 d, respectively, under aerobic conditions. rhodococcus ruber (strain e10) was observed to use mtbe and etbe as the sole carbon and energy source, whereas g. amicalis (strain t3) used tame as the sole carbon and energy source for growth. all the bacterial strains transformed oxygenates better in the presence of an alternative carbon source (ethanol) with the exception of a. calcoaceticus (strain m10). the capacity of the selected strains to remove mtbe,  etbe, and tame looks promising for application in bioremediation technologies.

TI  == assessment of biofilm cell removal and killing and biocide efficacy using the microtiter plate test.
AB  == biofilm formation on surfaces has serious economic and environmental implications. growth of biofilm within a water distribution system can lead to problems such as biocorrosion and biofouling accumulation. to prevent and control these occurrences, it is necessary to use suitable biocides to remove the biofilm and kill biofilm cells. in this study, the genera actinobacillus, branhamella, bacillus, micrococcus and acinetobacter were isolated from biofilms formed on brass coupons exposed to a cooling water system. it was shown by the microtiter plate test that a mixed culture of the isolates and a single culture of acinetobacter sp(2) produced high levels of biofilm formation. a microwell plate  technique was applied for assessment of the ability of various biocides to remove and kill mixed-culture biofilm cells and acinetobacter sp(2), the latter as a single-species biofilm with a high rate of biofilm production. the results showed that the mixed-culture biofilm cells had more resistance to removal and killing by some biocides, such as hydrogen peroxide and sulfathiazole, than the single-species biofilm cells (acinetobacter sp(2)). oxidising biocides, such as sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide, demonstrated a higher potential for biofilm removal and killing compared with non-oxidising biocides (sulfathiazole and glutaraldehyde).

AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize and compare the bacterial community structure of two distinct oil samples from a petroleum field in brazil by using both molecular, based on the construction of 16s rrna gene libraries, and cultivation methods. statistical comparisons of libraries based on amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) data revealed no significant differences between the communities recovered in the non-biodegraded (nbd) and highly biodegraded oils (hbd). blastn analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences representative of distinct ribotypes from both oils showed the presence of nine different bacterial genera in these samples, encompassing members of the genera arcobacter, halanaerobium, marinobacter, propionibacterium, streptomyces, leuconostoc, acinetobacter, bacillus and streptococcus. enrichments obtained using oil as inoculum and sole carbon source yielded bacterial isolates showing high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with achromobacter xylosoxidans, bacillus  subtilis, brevibacillus sp., dietzia sp. and methylobacterium sp. comparison between the data obtained using cultivation-independent and enrichment cultures suggests that different selection of community members may occur when using distinct approaches. all the organisms found, except for leuconostoc sp. and streptococus sp., have been previously reported in the literature as hydrocarbon  degraders and/or associated to oil field environments.

TI  == bacteria fauna from the house fly, musca domestica (l.).
AB  == the house fly, musca domestica has long been considered a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. the general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. the habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as human faeces, animal excreta, carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in peninsular malaysia. the flies  were baited with 10% sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. all materials  used for collection of samples were sterile. bacteria from fly sample were isolated using the normal isolation technique. bacillus sp., coccobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., microccus sp., streptococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp., escherichia sp., klebsiella sp. and yeast cells were isolated from feaces, vomitus, external surfaces and internal organs of house fly. newly emerged house fly did not harbour any bacteria.

TI  == [bacterial communities of brown and red algae from peter the great bay, the sea of japan].
AB  == the structure of microbial communities of brown algae, red algae, and of the red  alga gracilaria verrucosa, healthy and affected with rotten thallus, were comparatively investigated; 61 strains of heterotrophic bacteria were isolated and characterized. most of them were identified to the genus level, some vibrio spp., to the species level according to their phenotypic properties and the fatty acid composition of cellular lipids. the composition of the microflora of two species of brown algae was different. in chordaria flagelliformis, pseudomonas spp. prevailed, and in desmarestia viridis, bacillus spp. the composition of the  microflora of two red algae, g. verrucosa and camphylaephora hyphaeoides, differed mainly in the ratio of prevailing groups of bacteria. the most abundant  were bacteria of the cfb cluster and pseudoalteromonads. in addition, the following bacteria were found on the surface of the algae: sulfitobacter spp., halomonas spp., acinetobacter sp., planococcus sp., arthrobacter sp., and agromyces sp. from tissues of the affected g. verrucosa, only vibrios were isolated, both agarolytic and nonagarolytic. the existence of specific bacterial  communities characteristic of different species of algae is suggested and the relation of vibrio sp. to the pathological process in the tissues of g. verrucosa is supposed.

TI  == diverse uv-b resistance of culturable bacterial community from high-altitude wetland water.
AB  == isolation of most ultraviolet b (uv-b)-resistant culturable bacteria that occur in the habitat of laguna azul, a high-altitude wetland [4554 m above sea level (asl)] from the northwestern argentinean andes, was carried out by culture-based  methods. water from this environment was exposed to uv-b radiation under laboratory conditions during 36 h, at an irradiance of 4.94 w/m2. it was found that the total number of bacteria in water samples decreased; however, most of the community survived long-term irradiation (312 nm) (53.3 kj/m2). the percentage of bacteria belonging to dominant species did not vary significantly,  depending on the number of uv irradiation doses. the most resistant microbes in the culturable community were gram-positive pigmented species (bacillus megaterium [endospores and/or vegetative cells], staphylococcus saprophyticus, and nocardia sp.). only one gram-negative bacterium could be cultivated (acinetobacter johnsonii). nocardia sp. that survived doses of 3201 kj/m2 were the most resistant bacteria to uv-b treatment. this study is the first report on  uv-b resistance of a microbial community isolated from high-altitude extreme environments, and proposes a method for direct isolation of uv-b-resistant bacteria from extreme irradiated environments.

TI  == biofilm formation by bacterial associations under various salinities and copper ion stress.
AB  == the study addresses the effect of abiotic (medium salinity and copper ions) and biotic (interactions between populations) factors on the formation of structured  communities by binary associations consisting of halotolerant bacteria (alcaligenes sp. 1-1 or acinetobacter sp. 1-19) and a wild-type b. subtilis 2335  strain or a transgenic strain. the results showed that 250 mg l(-1) of copper ions inhibit formation of biofilms by monocultures of the tested strains. binary  associations of the strains were more resistant to high concentrations (250 mg l(-1)) of copper ions. at the lowest nacl concentration (0.05% and 2.5%) and in the presence of copper ions, bacilli seemed to help halotolerant bacteria survive. under increased salinity and in the presence of copper ions, structured  communities developed due to halotolerant bacteria. coexistence under stressful conditions was beneficial for the both groups of bacteria.

TI  == characterization of contamination in and toxicities of a shipyard area in hong kong.
AB  == this is the first integrated study on the contaminant characterization and toxicities of a shipyard area. this site in hong kong contained 3.6-33.4 mg kg(-1) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and 5-79 g kg(-1) oil and grease. other pollutants exceeding the dutch intervention values were total polyaromatic hydrocarbons, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals cu, pb and zn. these pollutants persisted partially owing to the poor fertility with <125 mg n kg(-1)  and <530 mg p kg(-1) typical of coastal soil. sediments collected within 100 m also showed contamination exceeding the china and hong kong intervention levels.  the shipyard soil killed two bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and acinetobacter sp.  isolated from a clean coastal soil, inhibited germination of three exogenous plants triticum aestivum, brassica chinense and lolium perenne, and inhibited proliferation of three indigenous bacteria: methylobacterium sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus. thus, ex situ remediation was needed.

TI  == streptomyces pharetrae sp. nov., isolated from soil from the semi-arid karoo region.
AB  == an actinomycete, strain cza14t, was isolated from worcester in the western cape province of south africa. based on rapid genus identification, 16s-rdna sequence  similarities and chemotaxonomy, strain cza14t was identified as a member of the genus streptomyces. it exhibited weak antibiosis against bacillus coagulans atcc  7050t, mycobacterium aurum a+ and acinetobacter calcoaceticus c91. the results of physiological tests and analysis of the 16s-rdna sequence allowed for the differentiation of strain cza14t from other species of the genus streptomyces. strain cza14t therefore represents a new species for which the name streptomyces  pharetrae is proposed, with the type strain cza14t (= dsm 41856t = nrrl 24333t).

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  == biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (hdm). we characterized biosurfactant producing microbial populations from a long beach soil, california (usa) and a hong kong soil (china), contaminated with diesel oil. a total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. the highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of l1, l2 and l3 isolates from a long beach soil (41.4mn m(-1)). isolate l1 (acinetobacter  junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5 mn m(-1)). the emulsifying capacity evaluated by the e24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate l5 (74%). no substantial emulsification was achieved with the  cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. based on surface tension and the e24 index results, isolates f1, f2, f3, f4, l1, l2, l3 and l4 were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as bacillus cereus, bacillus sphaericus, b. fusiformis, acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, pseudomonas sp. and b. pumilus, respectively. cluster analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. five isolates (isolates f1, f2, f3, f4 and l4) belong to the firmicutes order, two isolates (l1 and l3) belong to the proteobacteria order and one isolate (l2) is an actinomyces sp. simpson's index (1 - d) and the shannon-weaver index (h) revealed more diversity of hdm in the hong kong soil, while evenness (e) and the equitability (j) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.

TI  == biological treatments of textile industrial effluents in lagos metropolis, nigeria.
AB  == the assessment of the effluents from two textile industries in ilupeju in lagos metropolis, nigeria showed that they were high in conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (bod), chemical oxygen demand (cod), total dissolved solids (tds) and contained traces of heavy metals like ca, zn but high concentrations of cr and pb. these wastewaters are normally discharged into neighbouring water bodies. five bacterial groups, namely micrococcus sp., enterobacter sp., alcaligens sp.,  bacillus sp. and acinetobacter sp. were isolated from these effluents. they were  used individually for biotreatment and found to be able to utilize the components of the wastewaters for growth, bacillus sp. and acinetobacter sp. being the most  efficient utilizers as they were able to reduce bod to zero. the total viable count (tvc) increased significantly depicting growth of the bacterial population. the ph was regulated from 3.4-6.80 for nsf effluent and 12.2-10.29 for sti effluent. the work emphasises the level of industrial pollution in our environment as wastes are indiscrimately dumped into surrounding water bodies in  urban areas, the textile industry being a case study. the treatment of any form of waste before disposal into the environment is important and ensures safety of  the populace.

TI  == isolation and characterization of arsenate-reducing bacteria from arsenic-contaminated sites in new zealand.
AB  == two environmental sites in new zealand were sampled (e.g., water and sediment) for bacterial isolates that could use either arsenite as an electron donor or arsenate as an electron acceptor under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions, respectively. these two sites were subjected to widespread arsenic contamination  from mine tailings generated from historic gold mining activities or from geothermal effluent. no bacteria were isolated from these sites that could utilize arsenite or arsenate under the respective growth conditions tested, but a number of chemoheterotrophic bacteria were isolated that could grow in the presence of high concentrations of arsenic species. in total, 17 morphologically  distinct arsenic-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolates were enriched from the sediment samples, and analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence of these bacteria revealed them to be members of the genera exiguobacterium, aeromonas, bacillus, pseudomonas, escherichia, and acinetobacter. two isolates, exiguobacterium sp. wk6 and aeromonas sp. ca1, were of particular interest because they appeared to gain metabolic energy from arsenate under aerobic growth conditions, as demonstrated by an increase in cellular growth yield and growth rate in the presence of arsenate. both bacteria were capable of reducing arsenate to arsenite via a non-respiratory mechanism. strain wk6 was positive for arsb, but the pathway of arsenate reduction for isolate ca1 was via a hitherto unknown mechanism. these isolates were not gaining an energetic advantage from arsenate or arsenite utilization, but were instead detoxifying arsenate to arsenite. as a  subsidiary process to arsenate reduction, the external ph of the growth medium increased (i.e., became more alkaline), allowing these bacteria to grow for extended periods of time.

TI  == a novel lipopeptide, an inhibitor of bacterial adhesion, from the thermophilic and halotolerant subsurface bacillus licheniformis strain 603.
AB  == a new bacillus licheniformis strain, 603, isolated from a mixture of drilling fluid and subsurface thermal water, has been found to produce a cyclic lipopeptide which is released into cultural medium as well as present in cells as the major lipid constituent (57% of the total cell lipids extractable with 2:1 chloroform-methanol). the quantitative ratio of the extracellular and intracellular lipopeptide has been estimated as 23:10. the metabolite represents  a heptapeptide, l-asp-->l-leu-->l-leu-->l-val-->l-val-->l-glu-->l-leu, n-acylated to the n-terminal amino acid, l-asp, by a 3-hydroxy fatty acid (from 13:0 to 17:0 with n-, iso-, and anteiso-chains), the 3-oh group of which is esterified by the  c-terminal amino acid, l-leu. the chemical structure of the lipopeptide has been  established by means of infrared (ir), 1h- and 13c-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy, electrospray ionisation (esi) mass spectrometry (ms), including secondary ion mass spectrometry, along with chemical and enzymatic degradation. although a diversity of similar metabolites synthesised by various b. licheniformis strains are presently known, such a structure has not been reported thus far. added to the growth medium of strain 603 at the concentration  of 1.6 microg/ml, the lipopeptide prevents adhesion of cells to a glass surface.  also, it exhibits a considerable growth-inhibiting activity against corynebacterium variabilis and a much lower activity against acinetobacter sp.

TI  == novel growth media for rearing larval horn flies, haematobia irritans (diptera: muscidae).
AB  == experiments were conducted to develop an agar-based medium for rearing immature horn flies, hematobia irritans (l.). larval survival was determined on sterilized manure inoculated with pure and mixed cultures of acinetobacter sp., bacillus pumilus meyer & gottheil, comamonas acidovorans den dooren de jong, pseudomonas mendocina palleroni, flavobacterium sp. and empedobacter breve (holmes & owen). rearing larvae on mixed cultures enhanced pupal weight but not survival. horn fly larvae failed to survive when reared on standard bacteriological media inoculated with pure and mixed cultures of acinetobacter sp., p. mendocina, and c. acidovorans. larvae completed development on a minimal medium supplemented with alfalfa, egg proteins, and vitamins. medium with low alfalfa content (30 g alfalfa/500 ml minimal medium) had enhanced survival when supplemented with egg yolk protein and vitamins. medium with high alfalfa content (130 g alfalfa/500 ml minimal medium) had enhanced survival when supplemented with whole egg protein and vitamins. survival was also favored when media were inoculated with pure cultures of acinetobacter or acinetobacter mixed with either pseudomonas or comamonas. individual plates could support larvae developing from up to 40 eggs,  and survival was least variable when plates were inoculated with greater numbers  of eggs. this rearing system shows promise as a means for conducting standardized bioassays on a meridic diet.

(4), lactococcus piscium (270), leuconostoc gelidum (375), acinetobacter (3), aeromonas (1), bacillus (10), corynebacterium (3), enterobacteriaceae (1), pseudomonas (13) or psychrobacter (6). a wider range of organisms was isolated from ts (13 organisms) and bl (7) agars than from mrs agar (3). leuc. gelidum, lc. piscium and l. algidas increased in numbers during the first 3 weeks of storage from about 5 x 10(3) cfu/g to the level of about 10(8) cfu/g and persisted at this level thereafter. c. divergens and c. piscicola were inconsistently detected, but seemed to persist at the relatively low level of about 5 x 10(7) cfu/g during the last 3 weeks of storage. b. thermosphacta increased to the level of about 7 x 10(5) cfu/g during the first 2 weeks of storage, but was not detected thereafter. remaining organisms were detected sporadically at levels of <3.5 x 10(2) cfu/g during the first 2 weeks of storage.

TI  == expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. this process is attributed to  enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the presence of clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56  intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. methods: a total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. these 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-d glucuronide as substrate. results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. results: c. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for e coli, staphylococcus, corynebacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., streptococcus sp., and klebsiella sp. conclusion: c. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than e coli and klebsiella sp.

TI  == natural transformation in mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria: identification and characterization of novel, closely related competence genes in acinetobacter  sp. strain bd413 and thermus thermophilus hb27.
AB  == the mesophile acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 and the extreme thermophile thermus  thermophilus hb27 display high frequencies of natural transformation. in this study we identified and characterized a novel competence gene in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413, coma, whose product displays significant similarities to the competence proteins coma and comec in neisseria and bacillus species. transcription of coma correlated with growth phase-dependent transcriptional regulation of the recently identified pilin-like factors of the transformation machinery. this finding strongly suggests that coma is part of a competence regulon. examination of the genome sequence of t. thermophilus hb27 led to detection of a coma/comec-like open reading frame (orf) which is flanked by an orf whose product shows significant similarities to the bacillus subtilis competence protein comea. to examine whether these two orfs, designated comec and comea, are implicated in natural transformation of t. thermophilus hb27, both were disrupted by using a thermostable kanamycin resistance marker. natural transformation in comec mutants was reduced 1,000-fold, whereas in comea mutants  the natural transformation phenotype was completely eliminated. these results strongly suggest that both genes, comec and comea, are required for natural transformation in t. thermophilus hb27. several transmembrane alpha-helices are predicted based on the amino acid sequences of coma in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 and comec in t. thermophilus hb27, which suggests that coma and comec are located in the inner membrane and function in dna transport through the cytoplasmic membrane.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of bologna (italy).
AB  == samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. the microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as bacillus subtilis, bacillus brevis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus megaterium; the latter were corynebacterium glutamicum, actinomyces sp., alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, flavobacterium breve, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas stutzeri. these species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. this finding leads us  to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard  to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.

AB  == we recently identified a pilin-like competence factor, comp, which is essential for natural transformation of the gram-negative soil bacterium acinetobacter sp.  strain bd413. here we demonstrate that transcription and synthesis of the pilin-like competence factor comp are maximal in the late stationary growth phase, whereas competence is induced immediately after inoculation of a stationary-phase culture into fresh medium. western blot analyses revealed three  forms of comp, one with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kda, which correlates with the molecular mass deduced from the dna sequence, one 20-kda form, which was found to be glycosylated, and one 23-kda form. the glycosylation of comp was not  required for its function in dna binding and uptake. the 20-kda form was present  in the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasm, and the outer membrane, whereas the 23-kda form was located in the outer membrane and might be due to a further modification. immunological data suggest that comp is not a subunit of the pilus  structures. possible functions of comp in the dna transformation machinery of acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 are discussed.

TI  == comb, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. bd413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  == here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging orfs in acinetobacter sp.  bd413, namely lytb, orfy, orfx, comb, and orfz, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comc. the n-termini of the deduced proteins orfy and comb exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein comb is similar to type iv pilins. lytb is similar  to the escherichia coli lytb, which has been implicated in the stringent response. no homologues of orfx, orfy and orfz could be identified. a mutation in orfy or orfz led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comb resulted in a non-competent phenotype. disruption of lytb did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comb is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfy and orfz mutants were due to polar effects on comb and comc, respectively. analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comb mutant suggested that the competence gene comb is not essential for the biogenesis of type iv pili and expression of the type iv pili-associated property of twitching motility. transcriptional fusions between comb and a promoter-free lacz gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comb during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.

TI  == bacteria associated with butterfly stain of chilean tepa.
AB  == butterfly stain, common in chilean tepa (laureliopsis philippiana [looser] schodde) trees, appears in cross-section of the stem as a series of partially overlapping orange-brown arcs that in early stages resembles a butterfly. bacterial isolates from stained tepa wood samples cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were identified using several commercially available identification systems. pseudomonas sp. were most common in the cultures handled  aerobically, and clostridium sp. were found in the cultures handled anaerobically. a pectynolitic bacillus sp. and a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that emitted a strong naphthalene-like odor similar to that of stained  wood were also isolated. not all isolates could be identified. this the first report of clostridium from tepa.

TI  == the physiological contribution of acinetobacter pcak, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of vank.
AB  == vank is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with pcak, benk, and muck, contributes to aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1. vank and pcak have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype  associated with inactivation of its homolog. furthermore, vank pcak double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. this provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. previous studies of aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. by using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. in this study, the overlapping specificity of the vank and pcak permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vank or pcak. spontaneous mutations identified in vank include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a g6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of vank structure and function. preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated pcr mutagenesis in one vank mutant gave results similar to those using lacy, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. the selection for transport mutants described here for acinetobacter may also be applicable to pseudomonas putida, where the pcak permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.

TI  == dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.

TI  == a five-nucleotide sequence protects dna from exonucleolytic degradation by addab, the recbcd analogue of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == homologous recombination in bacillus subtilis requires the product of the adda and addb genes, the addab enzyme. this enzyme, which is both a helicase and a powerful nuclease, is thought to be the counterpart of the escherichia coli recbcd enzyme. from this analogy, it is expected that the nuclease activity of addab can be downregulated by a specific dna sequence, which would correspond to  the chi site in e. coli. using protection of linear double-stranded dna as a criterion, we identified the five-nucleotide sequence 5'-agcgg-3', or its complement 5'-ccgct-3', as being sufficient for addab nuclease attenuation. we have shown further that this attenuation occurs only if the sequence is properly  oriented with respect to the translocating addab enzyme. finally, inspection of the complete b. subtilis genome revealed that this five-nucleotide sequence is over-represented and is, in a majority of cases, co-oriented with dna replication. based on these observations, we propose that 5'-agcgg-3', or its complement, is the b. subtilis analogue of the e. coli chi sequence.

TI  == a novel competence gene, comp, is essential for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. strain bd413.
AB  == acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 (= atcc 33305), a nutritionally versatile bacterium, has an extremely efficient natural transformation system. here we describe the generation of eight transformation-affected mutants of acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 by insertional mutagenesis. these mutants were found by southern blot analysis and complementation studies to result from single nptii marker insertions at different chromosomal loci. dna binding and uptake studies with one mutant, t205, revealed that the transformation deficiency of this mutant results  from a complete lack of dna binding and, therefore, uptake activity. a novel competence gene essential for natural transformation, named comp, was cloned by complementation of mutant t205. the nucleotide sequence of comp was determined, and its deduced 15-kda polypeptide displays significant similarities to type iv pilins. analysis of the ultrastructure of a transformation-deficient comp mutant  and the transformation-competent wild-type strain revealed that both are covered  with bundle-forming thin fimbriae (3 to 4 nm in diameter) and individual thick fimbriae (6 nm in diameter). these results provide evidence that the pilinlike comp is unrelated to the piluslike structures of strain bd413. taking all data into account, we propose that comp functions as a major subunit of an organelle acting as a channel or pore mediating dna binding and/or uptake in acinetobacter  sp. strain bd413.

TI  == system to study horizontal gene exchange among microorganisms without cultivation of recipients.
AB  == ribosomal rna genes are characterized by highly conserved sequences and are present in multiple copies in most prokaryotic chromosomes. in principle, therefore, they might serve as sites for homologous recombination between unrelated microorganisms. plasmids containing 23s ribosomal gene sequences, from  different bacteria, which had been interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance gene, were used to transform acinetobacter sp. dsm587 (former name: acinetobacter calcoaceticus bd413-ivl10). in all cases, homologies  between the 23s rrna genes of phylogenetically distant bacteria and acinetobacter sp. dsm587 were sufficient for replacement recombination events. the integration  events, resulting in inactivation of any one of the seven rrn operons of acinetobacter sp. dsm587, had no observable influence on cell growth. these results suggest the possibility of rrna genes serving as natural vehicles for horizontal gene transfer. they also provide the basis of a novel strategy to analyse gene transfer without selection or cultivation of recipient cells. because of the highly conserved structure of bacterial rrn operons, recombination events subsequent to gene transfer can be readily identified by polymerase chain  reaction amplification of the recombinant sequence using a universal forward primer for the 16s rrna gene and a reverse primer specific for the integrated marker gene.

AB  == the structural gene coding for citrate synthase from the gram-positive soil isolate bacillus sp. strain c4 (atcc 55182) capable of secreting acetic acid at ph 5.0 to 7.0 in the presence of dolime has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking citrate synthase. the nucleotide sequence of the entire 3.1-kb hindiii fragment has been  determined, and one major open reading frame was found coding for citrate synthase (ctsa). citrate synthase from bacillus sp. strain c4 was found to be a dimer (mr, 84,500) with a subunit with an mr of 42,000. the n-terminal sequence was found to be identical with that predicted from the gene sequence. the kinetics were best fit to a bisubstrate enzyme with an ordered mechanism. bacillus sp. strain c4 citrate synthase was not activated by potassium chloride and was not inhibited by nadh, atp, adp, or amp at levels up to 1 mm. the predicted amino acid sequence was compared with that of the e. coli, acinetobacter anitratum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, rickettsia prowazekii, porcine heart, and saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes.

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.
