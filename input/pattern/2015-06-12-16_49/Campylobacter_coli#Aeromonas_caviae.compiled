TI  - Diagnostic potentials of the activities of lectins with whole cells of three bacterial diarrheagenic agents: Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Campylobacter.
AB  - The reactiviteisofstrains ofPlesionmona shigeloides, Campylobater jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Aeromonas species with some lectins namely Soyabean agglutinin (SBA), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA), Peanut agllutinin (PNA), Cancanavalin-A (Con-A), Lima bean agglutinin (LMA) and Abrin were investigated using the microtitre plate method. The results obtained show that all stains of A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. Sobria and P. shigelloides reacted very strongly with PNA and SBA. All strains of C. jejuni studied failed to react with SBA but reacted with PNA Whereas C. coli did not show any reaction towards PNA but reacted very strongly with SBA. All strains of the different organisms were strongly agglutinated by RCA and LMA except A. Hydrophilia and A. sobria which did not react with RCA and LMA respectively. C. jejuni was not agglutinated by Con-A unlike C. coli. Only C. jejuni, C. coli and P. shigelloides reacted with abrin. This study suggests that the reactivities of lectins with the diarrheogenic bacteria studied may be used for their presumptive identifications and for epidemiological purposes.
TI  - Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of acute diarrhea with emphasis on Entamoeba histolytica infections in preschool children in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
AB  - The epidemiology, clinical features, nutritional status, and causative agents of  diarrhea were studied in 289 Bangladeshi children (147 boys and 142 girls) 2-5 years old. The use of improved diagnostic tests for amebiasis enabled for the first time analysis of the contribution of Entamoeba histolytica to total diarrheal illness in this community setting. The average incidence rate of diarrhea was 1.8/child-year, and the average number of diarrheal days was 3.7 days/child-year over an average observation period of 2.8 years/child. Seventy-five percent of the diarrheal episodes were < or = 2 days in duration. Persistent diarrhea was relatively uncommon (0.2% of the children) and chronic diarrhea was observed in only one episode. Compared with malnourished and/or stunted children, better-nourished children experienced significantly fewer diarrheal episodes. The diarrheal incidence rate for children with blood group A was significantly less that that of the children with blood groups O and AB. The most frequent bacterial enteropathogens isolated from diarrheal stool specimens were enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (9%) and Aeromonas species (9%), followed by Plesimonas shigelloides (4%) and Shigella flexneri (3.8%). Rotavirus was the most common viral agent isolated from diarrheal stool samples (5%). Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and E. histolytica were identified in 11%, 8.4%, and 8%, respectively, of the diarrheal stool specimens. Dysentery was observed in 7.7% of all diarrheal episodes. The most common pathogens isolated from dysenteric stool were S. flexneri (11.6%), Aeromonas sp. (10%), E. histolytica (8.7%), Campylobacter jejunii (5.8%), P. shigelloides (4.3%), and A. caviae (4.3%). The overall incidence rate of E. histolytica-associated diarrhea was 0.08/child-year. Visible blood and hemoccult test-detected blood loss was found in 7% and 25%, respectively, of cases of E. histolytica-associated diarrhea. Children who had recovered from a diarrheal episode with E. histolytica, but not E. dispar, had half the chance of developing subsequent E. histolytica-associated diarrhea, consistent with the development of species-specific acquired immunity. In conclusion, the use of modern diagnostic tests demonstrated that E. histolytica contributed to overall morbidity from diarrheal illness. Understanding the etiology, frequency, and consequences of acute diarrhea in children from a developing country should aid in the design of interventions to improve child health.
TI  - The genetics of glycosylation in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in reports of glycosylation of proteins in various Gram-negative systems including Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Caulobacter crescentus, Aeromonas caviae and Helicobacter pylori. Although this growing list contains many important pathogens (reviewed by Benz and Schmidt [Mol. Microbiol. 45 (2002) 267-276]) and the glycosylations are found on proteins important in pathogenesis such as pili, adhesins and flagella the precise role(s) of the glycosylation of these proteins remains to be determined. Furthermore, the details of the glycosylation biosynthetic process have not been determined in any of these systems. The definition of the precise role of glycosylation and the mechanism of biosynthesis will be facilitated by a detailed understanding of the genes involved.
TI  - The occurrence of enteric pathogens and Aeromonas species in organic vegetables.
AB  - A range of commercially available organic vegetables (n = 86) was examined for the presence of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, E. coli O 157. Listeria and Aeromonas spp., to provide information on the occurrence of such organisms in organic vegetables in Northern Ireland. The study was not designed to quantify such organisms or to compare occurrence with conventionally farmed vegetables. Standard enrichment techniques were used to isolate and identify enteric pathogens and Aeromonas species. No Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli. E. coli O 157, Listeria were found in any of the samples examined. Aeromonas species were isolated from 34% of the total number of organic vegetables examined. Many (64%) of the organic vegetables examined were "ready-to-eat" after minimal processing, i.e., washing. Aeromonas spp. was isolated from 41% of these vegetables. Aeromonas spp. was not recovered from certain vegetable types. The most commonly isolated species of Aeromonas was Aeromonas schubertii with 21.0% of all samples contaminated with this species; 5.8% of samples contained A. hydrophila, 5.8% A. trota, 3.5% A. caviae and 2.3% contained A. veronii biovar veronii. Although Aeromonas species are frequently detected in organic vegetables, the absence of accepted enteric pathogens was encouraging, and does not support the allegation of organic foods being of high risk due to the farming methods used.
TI  - Some emerging food and water borne pathogens.
AB  - Emerging pathogens are those infective organisms whose incidence has recently increased or is likely to increase during the next two decades due to changes in demography, food habits, food technology, commerce, water sources and environmental factors. Some important emerging food and water borne bacterial pathogens include Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157: H7, Vibrio cholerae biotype E1 Tor Serotype 0139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila, A. sobria, and A. caviae. The prevalence, ecological relationships of these organisms, their transmission through food, water and other environmental sources, and role of their virulent factors in the pathogenesis of infections and their public health significance is discussed in this paper with special reference to the situation in India.
TI  - [Sensitivity of enteropathogenic bacteria to furazolidone].
AB  - The sensitivity in vitro of 348 strains of 18 enteropathogen agents to furazolidone was investigated during the period of 1987-1989. All strains of Shigella sonnei (17), S. flexneri (17), S. boydii (16), Escherichia coli enteropathogen (40), E. coli enteroinvasive (20), Campylobacter jejuni (50), Vibrio cholerae 01 (5), Vibrio cholerae non 01 (5), V. parahaemolyticus (5), V. alginolyticus (2), Aeromonas hydrophila (5), A. caviae (5), A. sobria (5), and Plesiomonas shigelloides (12) were sensitive (MIC < or = 8 mg/l), except a strains of E. coli enteropathogen (MIC 16 mg/l). The 15.5% of the 51 strains of Salmonella enterica belonging to the type I isolated between 1987 and 1989 were resistant (MIC > or = 16 mg/l). A similar degree of resistance was observed in 20 strains of this agent isolated between 1978 and 1980. The 30 strains of Yersinia (including 15 strains of Y. enterocolitica 03) presented extreme values of MICs of 8 and 16 mg/l.
TI  - [Studies on bacterial agents in acute diarrheal disease (1985-1987)].
AB  - A three-year epidemiological study (from January 1985 to December 1987) was carried out on sporadic cases of acute diarrhea. A total of 2889 fecal specimens in Cary-Blair transport medium were examined for bacterial enteric pathogens, and 832 strains of fifteen species were isolated from 739 specimens, 73 patients having two or more pathogens. C. jejuni shared 51.7%, Salmonella spp. 18.3%, V. parahaemolyticus 10.3%, and Aeromonas spp. 15.7% of total fecal specimens. Isolation rates of C. jejuni and Salmonella spp. in children under the age of fifteen years (19.3%, 6.4%) were higher than those of older years (9.8%, 3.9%), respectively. Isolation of C. jejuni decreased to 24% (12/50) during 2-4 days storage at room temperature in Cary-Blair transport medium, which showed the necessity of rapid plating for isolation of C. jejuni from fecal specimens. Incidence of A. caviae in children up to ten years of age was significantly higher as compared with those of other Aeromonas species. Desoxycholate-hydrogen sulfide-xylose-agar (DHXA) was used for direct plating technique and for plating after enrichment with alkaline peptone water (without NaCl), which was found suitable as an enrichment medium for Aeromonas spp. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 was isolated from 3 patients by using desoxycholate-hydrogen sulfide-sorbitol-agar (DHSA).
TI  - Clinical associations of Aeromonas spp. in fecal specimens from children.
AB  - Human infections caused by Aeromonas spp. are being reported with increased frequency. We examined 1012 unselected stool specimens from 799 children for various pathogens, including Aeromonas spp., to evaluate the clinical associations of Aeromonas spp. in the stools of children in the East End of London. A total of 33 children had positive cultures for Aeromonas spp. These were identified as: Aeromonas hydrophila (16), A. sobria (9), A. caviae (8). Aeromonas spp. were identified by being oxidase positive in character, a property that distinguishes Aeromonas spp. from Enterobacteriaceae. Associated pathogens included Salmonella typhimurium (1), Campylobacter spp. (3), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (2), and Giardia lamblia (1). Electron microscopic examination of the stool of 13 children revealed viral particles in two, rotavirus (1), and coronavirus-like particles (1). The associated clinical features in the 25 children with only Aeromonas excretion were diarrhea (21), vomiting (10), abdominal pain (9), fever (4), and mild dehydration (2). Five patients had macroscopic blood loss in the stools. The illness was generally mild and lasted only a short time.
