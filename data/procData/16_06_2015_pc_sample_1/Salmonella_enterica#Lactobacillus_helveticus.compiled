TI  - Functionality of the S-layer protein from the probiotic strain Lactobacillus helveticus M92.
AB  - The objective of this study was the characterisation of the S-layer protein (SlpA) and its functional role in the probiotic activity of Lactobacillus helveticus M92. SlpA was isolated and identified by SDS-PAGE LC-MS/MS analysis. The slpA gene encoding the SlpA from L. helveticus M92 was sequenced and compared with other well characterised slpA genes. Sequence similarity searches revealed high homology with the SlpA of Lactobacillus strains. Purified SlpA showed significantly better immunomodulatory effects in orally immunised mice than L. helveticus M92 cells after SlpA removal. SlpA is involved in the autoaggregation of L. helveticus M92 cells and coaggregation of L. helveticus M92 with S. Typhimurium FP1 as these processes were negatively affected after SlpA removal from the cell surface. Therefore, the influence of oral treatment with L. helveticus M92 on an oral infection of mice by S. Typhimurium FP1 was investigated. Following the oral immunization of mice, with viable L. helveticus M92 and S. Typhimurium FP1 cells, the concentration in the luminal contents of total S-IgA and specific anti-Salmonella S-IgA antibodies, from all immunized mice was significantly higher compared to the control group or a group of mice infected only with S. Typhimurium FP1. These results demonstrate that the observed reduced infection by S. Typhimurium FP1 in mice with L. helveticus M92 is associated with competitive exclusion in the intestinal tract and enhanced immune protection conferred by the L. helveticus M92 and its SlpA.
TI  - New signaling molecules in some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A new family of putative signaling molecules having a 2(5H)-furanone configuration has been described in this work. They were released during late exponential or stationary phase in different growth media by some gram-positive bacteria, such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Enterococcus faecalis, and a gram-negative species, i.e. Salmonella enterica. A pair of 2(5H)-furanones called furanones A and B occurred in all the conditioned media (CMs) of the species considered. These two molecules showed similar retention times and their spectral data shared the key fragments to include them in the 2(5H)-furanones family. However, some differences were observed in the mass fragmentation profiles. In particular the use of PCA analysis of all the mass fragments enabled the grouping of furanone A profiles of S. enterica, L. helveticus, L. plantarum, L. paraplantarum, L. sanfranciscensis and E. faecalis in one unique cluster with only few exceptions. On the other hand, the mass fragmentation profiles of furanone B of the major part of the species and strains could be grouped together and were differentiated from those of L. helveticus. The specific activity of cell-free supernatants of high density cultures of S. enterica confirmed that the release of active molecules, and specifically of furanones A and B, was cell density dependent. Moreover, a preliminary experiment suspending S. enterica cells into cell-free supernatants of L. helveticus previously exposed to an oxidative stress demonstrated that furanones A and B have a strong interspecific activity. In fact cell autolysis and cell envelope damages were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in S. enterica.
TI  - Milk fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus R389 and its non-bacterial fraction confer enhanced protection against Salmonella enteritidis serovar Typhimurium infection in mice.
AB  - Bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal tract represent a major global health problem, even in the presence of normally effective mucosal immune mechanisms. Milk fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus R389 (FM) or its non-bacterial fraction obtained by milk fermentation at controlled pH 6 (NBF) are able to activate the small intestine mucosal immune response according to previous studies. In this work we aimed at comparing their protection capacity against an infection by Salmonella enteritidis serovar Typhimurium and at studying the mechanisms involved. In a completely randomized design, BALB/c mice received FM or NBF for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days, followed by a single oral challenge with S. Typhimurium (10(7) cells/mouse). The increase in the number of IgA+ cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine, after the feeding periods, was accompanied by an increase in the luminal content of total S-IgA. However, no antibodies were produced against the NBF. In mice given the FM or the NBF for 7 consecutive days, lower levels of liver colonization on day 7 post-challenge with S. Typhimurium, higher luminal contents of specific anti-Salmonella S-IgA, higher percentages of survival to infection and lower numbers of MIP-1alpha+ cells in the lamina propria were observed. In this work we observed that in both the FM or the NBF there are active principles that confer enhanced protection against S. Typhimurium infection. However, the mechanisms underlying mucosal immunomodulation and protection are different. In those mechanisms, the mucosal immune response would seem to be more involved than the competitive or exclusion mechanisms between L. helveticus R389 and S. enteritidis serovar Typhimurium.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus helveticus strain KS300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the Lactobacillus helveticus strain KS300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia, uropathogenic Escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. METHODS AND RESULTS: The KS300 strain inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis, P. bivia, S. typhimurium, and pathogenic E. coli. After direct co-culture, data show that the Lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of G. vaginalis, P. bivia, S. typhimurium, and pathogenic E. coli. The adhering KS300 strain inhibited the adhesion of G. vaginalis DSM 4944 and uropathogenic Dr-positive E. coli IH11128 onto HeLa cells. Moreover, the KS300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic Dr-positive E. coli IH11128 within HeLa cells and S. typhimurium SL1344 within Caco-2/TC7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that L. helveticus strain KS300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Adhering L. helveticus strain KS300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Antimutagenic effects of milk fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus L89 and a protease-deficient derivative.
AB  - The antimutagenic effects of whey, acetone extracts, and protein fractions isolated from milk that had been fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus L89 were investigated using the mutagen 4-nitroquinoline-N'-oxide in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100). Fermented milk significantly inhibited mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-N'-oxide. However, milk fermented by a nonproteolytic variant of the same strain showed no inhibitory effects. Results were similar for the whey fractions and acetone extracts of the fermented milks. After fermentation, milk proteins were fractionated by size-exclusion HPLC and were tested for antimutagenicity. The fraction showing the greatest activity was further analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. Our results indicate that antimutagenic compounds are produced in milk during fermentation by L. helveticus, and the release of peptides is one possible contributing mechanism.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
