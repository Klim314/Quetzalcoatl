TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == the influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the function of cell-free solutions (cfss) of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (fbps) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) using hplc. cell free solutions were prepared from four lab strains. two different concentrations  which were 50% (5 ml cfs+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml cfs+7.5 ml medium/1:3)  cfs and the control without cfs were prepared. both concentration of cfs of streptococcus thermophilus and 50% cfs of pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by salmonella paratyphi a. tyramine production by escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% cfs of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% cfs of leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. the inhibitor effect of 50% cfs of p. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by listeria monocytogenes, following lc. lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% cfs of leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). the stimulation effects of 50% cfs of s. thermophilus and lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. cfs of lab strains showed  statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased ph quickly and reduced the formation of amn and bas. consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use cfs for food and food products.

TI  == in vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of vastedda-like cheese.
AB  == twelve lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously selected in vitro (gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for  the continuous four-season production of vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. the strains belonged to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and streptococcus thermophilus. lab were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth  of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (wbm) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in wbm and raw milk. the strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a ph drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. after 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in ph values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only lc. lactis subsp. cremoris pon153, ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides pon259 and  pon559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees c. a sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (pdo) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (vocs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (spme) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (gc/ms). the dominance of lactococci over thermophilic lab of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of voc profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of vastedda-like cheese.

TI  == microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  == the study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of st-nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. on the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named tr15 (truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: tr15-sc (58  isolates from tr15 collection), tr15-m (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and tr15-bhi (pools of isolates from bhi medium). their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk  were compared with the activity of complex consortium tr15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii). the natural consortium tr15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium tr15-bhi. the dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16s rdna sequencing and direct 16s rdna single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. the combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium tr15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics  than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such  as carnobacterium maltaromaticum, vagococcus fluvialis, enterococcus gilvus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas psychrophila and enterobacter spp.). the highest l. monocytogenes count was on rind with tr15-m and was positively associated with the highest ph value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by staphylococcus vitulinus, brevibacterium linens, microbacterium gubbeenense and brachybacterium tyrofermentans. the results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. it is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == concentration dependent effects of dextran on the physical properties of acid milk gels.
AB  == the effect of dextran from leuconostoc mesenteroides (dex500), added to milk prior to acidification with glucono-delta-lactone (gdl) or streptococcus thermophilus dsm20259, was studied with respect to polysaccharide concentration.  the incorporation of 5-30 g/kg dex500 significantly affected gelation behavior. increasing dex500 concentrations resulted in a linear increase of gel stiffness (gdl gels: r(2)=0.96; microbial acidification: r(2)=0.94; p<0.05) and 30 g/kg dex500 resulted in a 2-fold higher stiffness compared to gels without polysaccharide. the respective stirred gels depicted a significant reduction in syneresis, which decreased from 30.4% (0 g/kg dex500) to 22.0% (30 g/kg dex500) for chemically acidified gels after 1 d of storage. physical characteristics of dex500 in aqueous solution were helpful to explain its behavior in the complex system milk.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. in the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region. among these species, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while lactococcus  lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. in the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16s rdna full-length sequencing. according to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were l. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. only 3 species, which are  l. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. this study  showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. practical application: due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. for this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions  of turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular  methods.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == short communication: characterization of microflora in mexican chihuahua cheese.
AB  == this work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in mexico using 16s rrna gene analysis. as expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including escherichia coli and  staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in  9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent  being lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. leuconostoc mesenteroides and streptococcus macedonicus were identified  in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional chihuahua  cheese attributes.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == probiotic leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and streptococcus thermophilus  induce il-12 and ifn-gamma production.
AB  == aim: to investigate the capacity of potentially probiotic strains from six bacterial genera to induce cytokine production alone or in combinations in order  to identify potential enhancing or synergistic effects in order to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes. methods: cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in response to stimulation with eleven  different potentially probiotic bacterial strains from streptococcus, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, leuconostoc and propionibacterium genera was analysed. production and mrna expression of tnf-alpha, il-12, ifn-gamma and il-10 were determined by elisa and northern blotting, respectively. results: all tested bacteria induced tnf-alpha production. the best inducers of th1 type cytokines il-12 and ifn-gamma were streptococcus and leuconostoc strains. all bifidobacterium and propionibacterium strains induced higher il-10 production than other studied bacteria. stimulation of pbmc with any bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production suggesting that different bacteria whether gram-positive or gram-negative compete with each other during host cell interactions. conclusion: the probiotic s. thermophilus and leuconostoc strains are more potent inducers of th1 type cytokines il-12 and ifn-gamma than the probiotic lactobacillus strains. bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production.

AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin salers cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

TI  == feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations actimel and indian dahi.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. the design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the delhi university college hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre nand nagri, a resettlement colony in east delhi. children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. group 1 was given a fermented milk, actimel, containing 10(8) of each lactobacillus casei dn-114001,  lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus per gram. group 2 was given indian dahi (lf 40) containing 10(8) of each lactococcus lactis, lactococcus lactis cremoris and leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. in the hospital study  indian dahi and actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3  and 0.6 day (p<0.001), respectively. the corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (p<0.05), respectively. the families using actimel as  a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. in conclusion, actimel, fermented milk containing lactobacillus casei dn-114001, and indian dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == a pcr-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  == we developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. one specific primer, lblma1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16s and 23s rrna genes in a number of lactobacillus strains. amplification with lblma1-rev and r16-1, a universal primer, generated a pcr product for 23 lactobacillus species. electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus, carnobacterium pissicola,  pediococcus pentosaceus, bifidobacterium bifidum, weissella confusa, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus or listeria monocytogenes dna were used as template.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria for bile salt hydrolase activity.
AB  == bile salt hydrolysis is an important metabolic reaction in the bile salt metabolism of mammals. this reaction has a facilitating effect for bile salt excretion but can also be involved in various illnesses. in recent years interest has increased to use bile salt hydrolysis to influence the cholesterol metabolism of humans and farm animals. to understand the distribution and range of bile salt hydrolase activity in lactic acid bacteria, we screened more than 300 strains of  the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus and the species lactococcus lactis,  leuconostoc mesenteroides, and streptococcus thermophilus. results obtained for 273 strains showed that bile salt hydrolase activity is common in bifidobacterium and lactobacillus but absent in l. lactis, leu. mesenteroides, and s. thermophilus. nearly all bifidobacteria species and strains have bile salt hydrolase activity, whereas this activity can only be found in selected species of lactobacilli. a strong correlation can be observed between the habitat of a genus or species and the presence of bile salt hydrolase activity. most often bile salt hydrolase activity is found in strains that have been isolated from the intestines or from feces from mammals--an environment rich in conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. strains and species from other habitats like milk or vegetables--environments from which bile salts are absent--do normally not have bile salt hydrolase activity. in two independent assays, we established that bile salt hydrolase activity in bifidobacteria is, in general, much higher than in lactobacilli.

TI  == molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  == the development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. analysis of  rapd fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of  25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides,  leuc. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, strep. bovis, strep. uberis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. garviae, carnobacterium divergens, c. piscicola, aerococcus viridans, staphylococcus carnosus, staph. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, ent. sulphureus and enterococcus spp. the bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. two strains, belonging to strep. thermophilus and l. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; thel. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.

TI  == antitumor activity of lactic acid bacteria on a solid fibrosarcoma, sarcoma-180 and ehrlich ascites carcinoma.
AB  == antitumor activity of leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus cremoris and streptococcus lactis was investigated in solid mouse fibrosarcoma. intratumor administration of lyophilised bacterial cells at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt resulted in the regression of tumors in a maximum number of animals. intraperitoneal injection at the same dose resulted in a significant increase in  the survival time but was ineffective in curing the animals. intratumor injection of streptococcus thermophilus at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt also inhibited the growth of fibrosarcoma accompanied by an increase in the survival time while intraperitoneal administration of s. thermophilus prolonged only the survival time and did not result in cure. in mice bearing the ascitic form of sarcoma-180  or ehrlich ascites carcinoma, intraperitoneal administration of s. thermophilus resulted in complete cure in a very significant proportion of tumor-bearing mice. s. thermophilus was more effective in sarcoma-180 than in ehrlich ascites carcinoma. the cured tumors did not recur.

TI  == culture of five commonly used acid-producing bacteria on banana pulp.
AB  == a significant fraction of the bananas and plantains produced in the humid tropics are wasted due to rapid spoilage. the use of acid-producing, anaerobic fermentation may be a safe and economical way to preserve the fruit in both large- and small-scale applications. the abilities of five commonly used, acid-producing bacteria to ferment media containing ripe or green bananas were examined. three homofermentative bacteria, lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and streptococcus faecalis, typically reduced the ph  of a puree of ripe bananas from 4.8 to about 3.5 to 3.6 in 7 days at 37 degrees c. action on green bananas was similar, but the drop in ph was less pronounced. very little gas evolved. lactobacillus fermentum (formerly lactobacillus fermenti) and leuconostoc mesenteroides showed active gas evolution and a significant drop in ph. about twice as much gas evolved from ripe banana medium as from green bananas. the fermented purees were spongy, soft solids floating in  a clear liquor. the color was medium to light creamy brown, and the odor was pleasant. fermented products stored at room temperature retained good appearance  and aroma throughout a 1-month storage test.
