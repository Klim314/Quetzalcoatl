TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == use of tests for acidification of methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside and susceptibility to efrotomycin for differentiation of strains of enterococcus and  some related genera.
AB  == a total of 107 enterococcus strains, 10 vagococcus fluvialis strains, and 8 lactococcus garvieae strains were tested for acidification of methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (mgp) and susceptibility to 100-microg efrotomycin (efro) disks. all 26 strains of enterococcus casseliflavus, including 3 nonmotile and 2 nonpigmented strains, acidified mgp and were resistant to efro. all 22 strains of enterococcus gallinarum, including 5 nonmotile strains, also acidified mgp and were resistant to efro. none of the 26 strains of enterococcus faecium acidified mgp, and all were susceptible to efro. although all 12 enterococcus faecalis strains were also negative in the mgp test, they were resistant to efro. other enterococcal strains gave variable results. all 10 strains of v. fluvialis  and all 8 strains of l. garvieae gave positive and negative results, respectively, in the mgp test and were, respectively, resistant and susceptible to efro. these results indicate that tests of the production of acid from mgp and susceptibility to efro can be used as adjunct tests in the identification of typical and atypical strains of enterococci in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
