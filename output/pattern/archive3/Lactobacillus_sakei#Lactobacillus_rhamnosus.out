potentially probiotic and bioprotective lactic acid bacteria starter cultures antagonise the listeria monocytogenes adhesion to ht29 colonocyte-like cells.
the capability of five lactic acid bacteria (lab) to counteract the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line ht29 was studied. the highest adhesion ability to ht29 was achieved by the intestinal strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, followed by the meat-derived strains lactobacillus sakei ctc494 and enterococcus faecium ctc8005. surprisingly, the meat strains showed significantly better adhesion to ht29 than two faecal isolates of lactobacillus casei and even significantly higher than the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture l. sakei ctc494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of l. monocytogenes to ht29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. the performance was better than the faecal isolate l. rhamnosus ctc1679. our results reinforce the fact that the ability of lab to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food lab behave better than intestinal ones. therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. these strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible.
antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
