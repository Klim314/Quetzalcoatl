TI  == efflux pump-deficient mutants as a platform to search for microbes that produce antibiotics.
AB  == pseudomonas putida dot-t1e-18 is a strain deficient in the major antibiotic efflux pump (ttgabc) that exhibits an overall increased susceptibility to a wide  range of drugs when compared with the wild-type strain. we used this strain as a  platform to search for microbes able to produce antibiotics that inhibit growth.  a collection of 2400 isolates from soil, sediments and water was generated and a  drop assay developed to identify, via growth inhibition halos, strains that prevent the growth of dot-t1e-18 on solid luria-bertani plates. in this study, 35 different isolates that produced known and unknown antibiotics were identified. the most potent inhibitor of dot-t1e-18 growth was an isolate named 250j that, through multi-locus sequence analysis, was identified as a pseudomonas sp. strain. culture supernatants of 250j contain four different xantholysins that prevent growth of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative and fungi. two of the xantholysins were produced in higher concentrations and purified. xantholysin a was effective against bacillus, lysinibacillus and rhodococcus strains, and the effect against these microbes was enhanced when used in combination with other antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin and kanamycin. xantholysin c was also  efficient against gram-positive bacteria and showed an interesting antimicrobial  effect against pseudomonas strains, and a synergistic inhibitory effect with ampicillin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin.

TI  == research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  == the biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. this method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. the main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. this purifier is called biofilter. the biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. in order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. according to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. when acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. the species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. bacillus (b. cereus, b. subtilis),  pseudomonas (p. aeruginosa, p. putida), stapylococcus (s. aureus) and rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 cfu g-1.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == effect of vanadium toxicity at its different oxidation states on selected bacterial and protozoan isolates in wastewater systems.
AB  == this study assesses and compares vanadium toxicity in its different oxidation states towards bacterial isolates (pseudomonas putida and bacillus licheniformis) and protozoan isolates (peranema sp. and trachelophyllum sp.). the isolates were  exposed to various concentrations of v in mixed liquors and their tolerance to v  was assessed at 30 degrees c at a ph of 4. the results revealed that the increase in v oxidation state increased its toxicity to bacterial isolates, whereas its toxicity decreased for protozoan isolates. among the bacterial isolates, p putida was found to be more tolerant to v3+(24h-median lethal concentration (lc50): 390mg/l), v4+(24h-lc50: 230-250mg/l) and v5+(24h-lc50: 180-200mg/l), whereas for  the protozoan isolates, peranema sp. appeared to be more tolerant to v3+(24 h-lc50: 110-120 mg/l), v4+(24 h-lc50: 160-170 mg/l) and v5+(24 h-lc50: 160-200 mg/l). a comparison of both groups of organisms revealed trachelophyllum sp. as the most sensitive organism to v at its various oxidation states. the visual and  spectrophotometric methods used to assess v reduction revealed that p. putida was the only isolate able to reduce v5+, v4+ and v3+ to v2+ in mixed liquor media. vanadium (+2) in concentrations of approximately 46.46 mg/l, 29.57 m mg/l and 38.01 mg/l found in the media was treated with v3+, v4+ and v5+, respectively, and inoculated with p. putida. this study revealed that the ability of v reduction, adopted with p putida, can be an effective strategy to remove v from polluted environments. this study also showed that the toxicity of v, in terms of its oxidation states, differs from one species to another and in kingdoms.

TI  == interaction among multiple microorganisms and effects of nitrogen and carbon supplementations on lignin degradation.
AB  == the mutual interactions among the consortium constructed by four indigenous bacteria and five inter-kingdom fusants and the effects of nitrogen and carbon supplementations on lignin degradation and laccase activity were investigated. analyzed by plackett-burman and central composite design, the microbial consortium were optimized, bacillus sp. (b) and pe-9 and pseudomonas putida (pp)  and pe-9 had significant interactions on lignin degradation based on a 5% level of significance. the nitrogen and carbon supplementations played an important role in lignin degradation and laccase production. the ultimate lignin degradation efficiency of 96.0% and laccase activity of 268u/l were obtained with 0.5g/l of ammonium chloride and 2g/l of sucrose. results suggested that a stable  and effective microbial consortium in alkalescent conditions was successfully achieved through the introduction of fusants, which was significant for its industrial application.

TI  == isotope fractionation associated with the biodegradation of 2- and 4-nitrophenols via monooxygenation pathways.
AB  == monooxygenation is an important route of nitroaromatic compound (nac) biodegradation and it is widely found for cometabolic transformations of nacs and other aromatic pollutants. we investigated the c and n isotope fractionation of nitrophenol monooxygenation to complement the characterization of nac (bio)degradation pathways by compound-specific isotope analysis (csia). because of the large diversity of enzymes catalyzing monooxygenations, we studied the combined c and n isotope fractionation and the corresponding (13)c- and (15)n-apparent kinetic isotope effects (akies) of four nitrophenol-biodegrading microorganisms (bacillus spharericus js905, pseudomonas sp. 1a, arthrobacter sp.  js443, pseudomonas putida b2) in the ph range 6.1-8.6 with resting cells and crude cell extracts. while the extent of c and n isotope fractionation and the akie-values varied considerably for the different organisms, the correlated c and n isotope signatures (delta(15)n vs delta(13)c) revealed trends, indicative of two distinct monooxygenation pathways involving hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone or 1,2-  and 1,4-benzoquinone intermediates, respectively. the distinction was possible based on larger secondary (15)n-akies associated with the benzoquinone pathway. isotope fractionation was neither masked substantially by nitrophenol speciation  nor transport across cell membranes. only when 4-nitrophenol was biodegraded by pseudomonas sp. 1a did isotope fractionation become negligible, presumably due to rate-limiting substrate binding steps pertinent to the catalytic cycle of flavin-dependent monooxygenases.

TI  == assessing the resistance and bioremediation ability of selected bacterial and protozoan species to heavy metals in metal-rich industrial wastewater.
AB  == background: heavy-metals exert considerable stress on the environment worldwide.  this study assessed the resistance to and bioremediation of heavy-metals by selected protozoan and bacterial species in highly polluted industrial-wastewater. specific variables (i.e. chemical oxygen demand, ph, dissolved oxygen) and the growth/die-off-rates of test organisms were measured using standard methods. heavy-metal removals were determined in biomass and supernatant by the inductively couple plasma optical emission spectrometer. a parallel experiment was performed with dead microbial cells to assess the biosorption ability of test isolates. results: the results revealed that the industrial-wastewater samples were highly polluted with heavy-metal concentrations exceeding by far the maximum limits (in mg/l) of 0.05-co, 0.2-ni,  0.1-mn, 0.1-v, 0.01-pb, 0.01-cu, 0.1-zn and 0.005-cd, prescribed by the un-fao. industrial-wastewater had no major effects on pseudomonas putida, bacillus licheniformis and peranema sp. (growth rates up to 1.81, 1.45 and 1.43 d-1, respectively) compared to other test isolates. this was also revealed with significant cod increases (p < 0.05) in culture media inoculated with living bacterial isolates (over 100%) compared to protozoan isolates (up to 24% increase). living pseudomonas putida demonstrated the highest removal rates of heavy metals (co-71%, ni-51%, mn-45%, v-83%, pb-96%, ti-100% and cu-49%) followed by bacillus licheniformis (al-23% and zn-53%) and peranema sp. (cd-42%). none of  the dead cells were able to remove more than 25% of the heavy metals. bacterial isolates contained the genes copc, chrb, cnra3 and ncca encoding the resistance to cu, cr, co-ni and cd-ni-co, respectively. protozoan isolates contained only the genes encoding cu and cr resistance (copc and chrb genes). peranema sp. was the only protozoan isolate which had an additional resistant gene cnra3 encoding  co-ni resistance. conclusion: significant differences (p < 0.05) observed between dead and living microbial cells for metal-removal and the presence of certain metal-resistant genes indicated that the selected microbial isolates used both passive (biosorptive) and active (bioaccumulation) mechanisms to remove heavy metals from industrial wastewater. this study advocates the use of peranema sp. as a potential candidate for the bioremediation of heavy-metals in wastewater treatment, in addition to pseudomonas putida and bacillus licheniformis.

TI  == study in vitro of the impact of endophytic bacteria isolated from centella asiatica on the disease incidence caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus colletotrichum higginsianum.
AB  == thirty-one endophytic bacteria isolated from healthy leaves of centella asiatica  were screened in vitro for their ability to reduce the growth rate and disease incidence of colletotrichum higginsianum, a causal agent of anthracnose. isolates of cohnella sp., paenibacillus sp. and pantoea sp. significantly stimulated the growth rate of c. higginsianum mucl 44942, while isolates of achromobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., microbacterium sp., klebsiella sp. and pseudomonas putida had  no influence on this plant pathogen. by contrast, bacillus subtilis bca31 and pseudomonas fluorescens bca08 caused a marked inhibition of c. higginsianum mucl  44942 growth by 46 and 82 %, respectively. cell-free culture filtrates of b. subtilis bca31 and p. fluorescens bca08 were found to contain antifungal compounds against c. higginsianum mucl 44942. inoculation assays on in vitro-cultured plants of c. asiatica showed that foliar application of b. subtilis bca31, three days before inoculation with c. higginsianum mucl 44942, significantly reduced incidence and severity of the disease. the role of endophytic bacteria in maintaining the apparent inactivity of c. higginsianum mucl 44942 in c. asiatica grown in the wild is discussed.

TI  == soil bacterial consortia and previous exposure enhance the biodegradation of sulfonamides from pig manure.
AB  == persistence or degradation of synthetic antibiotics in soil is crucial in assessing their environmental risks. microbial catabolic activity in a sandy loamy soil with pig manure using 12c- and 14c-labelled sulfamethazine (smz) respirometry showed that smz was not readily degradable. but after 100 days, degradation in sulfadiazine-exposed manure was 9.2%, far greater than soil and organic manure (0.5% and 0.11%, respectively, p < 0.05). abiotic degradation was  not detected suggesting microbial catabolism as main degradation mechanism. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism showed biodiversity increases within 1 day of smz spiking and especially after 200 days, although some species  plummeted. a clone library from the treatment with highest degradation showed that most bacteria belonged to alpha, beta and gamma classes of proteobacteria, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and acidobacteria. proteobacteria (alpha, beta and gamma), firmicutes and bacteroidetes which were the most abundant classes on day  1 also decreased most following prolonged exposure. from the matrix showing the highest degradation rate, 17 smz-resistant isolates biodegraded low levels of 14c-labelled smz when each species was incubated separately (0.2-1.5%) but biodegradation was enhanced when the four isolates with the highest biodegradation were incubated in a consortium (bacillus licheniformis, pseudomonas putida, alcaligenes sp. and aquamicrobium defluvium as per 16s rrna gene sequencing), removing up to 7.8% of smz after 20 days. one of these species  (b. licheniformis) was a known livestock and occasional human pathogen. despite an environmental role of these species in sulfonamide bioremediation, the possibility of horizontal transfer of pathogenicity and resistance genes should caution against an indiscriminate use of these species as sulfonamide degraders.

TI  == first report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme produced by bacillus pumilus sg2.
AB  == bacillus pumilus sg2 isolated from high salinity ecosystem in iran produces two chitinases (chis and chil) and secretes them into the medium. in this study, chis and chil genes were cloned in pqe-30 expression vector and were expressed in the  cytoplasm of escherichia coli strain m15. the recombinant proteins were purified  using ni-nta column. the optimum ph and optimum temperature for enzyme activity of chis were ph 6, 50 degrees c; those of chil were ph 6.5, 40 degrees c. the purified chitinases showed antifungal activity against fusarium graminearum, rhizoctonia solani, magnaporthe grisea, sclerotinia sclerotiorum, trichoderma reesei, botrytis cinerea and bipolaris sp. moreover, purified chis was identified as chitinase/lysozyme, which are capable of degrading the chitin component of fungal cell walls and the peptidoglycan component of cell walls with many kinds of bacteria (xanthomonas translucens pv. hordei, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, bacillus licheniformis, e. coli c600, e. coli top10, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida). strong homology was found between the three-dimensional structures of chis and a chitinase/lysozyme from bacillus circulans wl-12. this is the first report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme from b. pumilus.

TI  == comparing the tolerance limits of selected bacterial and protozoan species to nickel in wastewater systems.
AB  == heavy-metal resistant microorganisms play a significant role in the treatment of  industrial wastewater. the detoxifying ability of these resistant microorganisms  can be manipulated for bioremediation of heavy metals in wastewater systems. this study aimed at comparing the tolerance limit of selected wastewater protozoan species (aspidisca sp., trachelophyllum sp. and peranema sp.) against ni(2+) with that of selected bacterial species (bacillus licheniformis-atcc12759, brevibacillus laterosporus-atcc64 and pseudomonas putida-atcc31483) commonly found in wastewater systems. the isolates were exposed to various concentrations  of ni(2+) in mixed liquor and their tolerance to ni(2+) assessed at different temperatures (25 degrees c, 30 degrees c, 35 degrees c and 40 degrees c) and phs  (4, 6, 7, 8 and 10). the physicochemical parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (cod) and dissolved oxygen (do) of the media and the growth rates of the isolates were measured using standard methods. in terms of their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), the results revealed that the isolates could tolerate ni(2+) at concentrations ranging between 32 and 52ppm for protozoa and between 52 and 84ppm for bacteria. b. licheniformis-atcc12759 was the most tolerant bacterial species (mic: 84ppm-ni(2+)) while peranema sp. was the most tolerant protozoan species (mic: 52ppm-ni(2+)). at 10 and/or 20ppm-ni(2+) the growth of b. licheniformis-atcc12759 (6.30 days(-1) for 10 and 5.73 days(-1) for  20ppm-ni(2+)), p. putida-atcc31483 (6.02 days(-1) for 10 and 5.31 days(-1) for 20ppm-ni(2+)) and peranema sp. (2.15 days(-1) for 10ppm-ni(2+)) was stimulated after one day of incubation. statistical evidence showed significant differences  (p=0.0065) between the mic of the six isolates and positive correlations between  cod and the growth rates of isolates (r=0.8999/0.8810 for bacteria/protozoa). the tolerance limit of all isolates was significantly dependent on the ph and the temperature. the study suggests that these isolates can be used for the bioremediation of nickel in industrial wastewater systems.

TI  == aerobic degradation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene by individual bacterial strains and defined mixed population in submerged cultures.
AB  == the degradation efficiencies of isomeric mononitrotoluenes (2- and 4-nts) and dinitrotoluenes (2,4-dnt and 2,6-dnt) by either individual bacterial strains (bacillus cereus ndt4, pseudomonas putida ndt1, pseudomonas fluorescens ndt2, and achromobacter sp. ndt3) or their mixture were compared in submerged batch cultivations. the mixed culture degraded 2,4-dnt nearly 50 times faster than any  of the individual strains. the mixed culture also demonstrated significantly shorter lag periods in 2,4-dnt degradation, a lack of nitrite or organic intermediates accumulation in the liquid medium and the ability to degrade a broader spectrum of nitrotoluenes over a wider concentration range. the presence  of both readily degradable 2-nt (or 4-nt) and poorly degradable 2,6-dnt in the medium negatively affected 2,4-dnt biodegradation. however, the mixed bacterial culture still effectively degraded 2,4-dnt with only slightly lower rates under these unfavorable conditions, thus showing potential for the remediation of 2,4-dnt contaminated sites.

TI  == the microbiota of an unpolluted calcareous soil faces up chlorophenols: evidences of resistant strains with potential for bioremediation.
AB  == to highlight the effects of a variety of chlorophenols (cp) in relation to the response of an indigenous bacterial community, an agricultural mediterranean calcareous soil has been studied in microcosms incubated under controlled laboratory conditions. soil samples were artificially polluted with 2-monochlorophenol (mcp), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (tcp) and pentachlorophenol (pcp), at concentrations ranging from 0.1 up to 5000 mg kg(-1). both activity and composition of the microbial community were assessed during several weeks, respectively, by respirometric methods and pcr-dgge analysis of extracted dna and rna. significant decreases in soil respirometric values and changes in the bacterial community composition were observed at concentrations above 1000 mg kg(-1) mcp and tcp, and above 100 mg kg(-1) pcp. however, the persistence of several active bacterial populations in soil microcosms contaminated with high concentration of cp, as indicated by dgge fingerprints, suggested the capacity of these native bacteria to survive in the presence of the pollutants, even without  a previous adaptation or contact with them. the isolation of potential cp degraders was attempted by culture plating from microcosms incubated with high cp concentrations. twenty-three different isolates were screened for their resistance to tcp and pcp. the most resistant isolates were identified as kocuria palustris, lysobacter gummosus, bacillus sp. and pseudomonas putida, according to 16s rrna gene homology. in addition, these four isolates also showed the capacity to reduce the concentration of tcp and pcp from 15% to 30% after 5d of incubation in laboratory assays (initial pollutant concentration of 50 mg l(-1)). isolate itp29, which could be a novel species of bacillus, has been revealed as the first known member in this bacterial group with potential for cp bioremediation applications, usually wide-spread in the soil natural communities, which has not  been reported to date as a cp degrader.

TI  == myxotyrosides a and b, unusual rhamnosides from myxococcus sp.
AB  == myxobacteria are gliding bacteria of the delta-subdivision of the proteobacteria  and known for their unique biosynthetic capabilities. two examples of a new class of metabolites, myxotyrosides a (1) and b (2), were isolated from a myxococcus sp. the myxotyrosides have a tyrosine-derived core structure glycosylated with rhamnose and acylated with unusual fatty acids such as (z)-15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic and (z)-2-hexadecenoic acid. the fatty acid profile  of the investigated myxococcus sp. (strain 131) is that of a typical myxobacterium with a high similarity to those described for m. fulvus and m. xanthus, with significant concentrations of neither 15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic acid nor 2-hexadecenoic acid being detected.

AB  == in this study, the possibility of establishing a dual-species biofilm from a bacterium with a high biofilm-forming capability and a 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (3,5-dnba)-degrading bacterium, comamonas testosteroni a3, was investigated. our  results showed that the combinations of strain a3 with each of five strains with  a high biofilm-forming capability (pseudomonas sp. m8, pseudomonas putida m9, bacillus cereus m19, pseudomonas plecoglossicida m21 and aeromonas hydrophila m22) presented different levels of enhancement regarding biofilm-forming capability. among these culture combinations, the 24-h dual-species biofilms established by c. testosteroni a3 with p. putida m9 and a. hydrophila m22 showed  the strongest resistance to 3,5-dnba shock loading, as demonstrated by six successive replacements with dmm2 synthetic wastewater. the degradation rates of  3,5-dnba by these two culture combinations reached 63.3-91.6% and 70.7-89.4%, respectively, within 6 h of every replacement. using the gfp-tagged strain m22 and confocal laser scanning microscopy, the immobilization of a3 cells in the dual-species biofilm was confirmed. we thus demonstrated that, during wastewater  treatment processes, it is possible to immobilize degrader bacteria with bacteria with a high biofilm-forming capability and to enable them to develop into the mixed microbial flora. this may be a simple and economical method that represents a novel strategy for effective bioaugmentation.

TI  == a marine mesorhizobium sp. produces structurally novel long-chain n-acyl-l-homoserine lactones.
AB  == our study focused on a mesorhizobium sp. that is phylogenetically affiliated by 16s rrna gene sequence to other marine and saline bacteria of this genus. liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometry investigations of the extract obtained from solid-phase extraction of cultures of this bacterium indicated the presence of several n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls), with chain lengths of c(10) to c(16).  chromatographic separation of the active bacterial extract yielded extraordinarily large amounts of two unprecedented acylated homoserine lactones,  5-cis-3-oxo-c(12)-homoserine lactone (5-cis-3-oxo-c(12)-hsl) (compound 1) and 5-cis-c(12)-hsl (compound 2). quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 was shown in two different biosensor systems [escherichia coli mt102(psb403) and pseudomonas putida f117(pkr-c12)]. furthermore, it was shown that both compounds  can restore protease and pyoverdin production of an ahl-deficient pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 lasi rhli double mutant, suggesting that these signal molecules maybe used for intergenus signaling. in conclusion, these data indicate that the  quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 is modulated by the chain length and functional groups of the acyl moiety. additionally, compound 1 showed antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.

TI  == microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media.
AB  == microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media were investigated for seven typical rod-shaped bacterial strains of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceas, and bacillaceae, which included escherichia coli hb101, escherichia coli jm109, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas sp., and bacillus subtilis. all the microorganisms studied exhibited a monopolar and predominant hydrophilic surface  and a negative delta g132tot, total free energy of interactions between microbes  (1) and silica gel or canadian river alluvium (cra) (2) immersed in water (3) at  the equilibrium distance, which accounted for their attachment on the medium surface. the microbial attachment was proportional to the corresponding delta g132tot values. among the microorganisms studied, b. subtilis had the most attachment on both silica gel and cra because it had the smallest delta g132tot values (-17.14kt for silica gel and -21.84kt for cra). the origins of lifshitz-van der waals, lewis acid/base, and electrostatic interactions were discussed and related to experimental observations.

TI  == use of heterotrophic co2 assimilation as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile bacteria.
AB  == we have examined whether assimilation of co2 can be used as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria. co2 assimilation by environmental samples and pure cultures of heterotrophic bacteria was studied using 14co2 and 13co2 as tracers. heterotrophic growth on complex organic substrates resulted in assimilation of co2 into cell biomass by activated sludge, drinking water biofilm, and pure cultures of escherichia coli atcc 25922, es. coli atcc 13706, rhodococcus ruber, burkholderia sp., bacillus circulans, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. analysis of 13c-labelled phospholipid fatty acids (plfas) confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria may assimilate 13co2 into cell macromolecules such as membrane lipids. all major plfas extracted from activated sludge and drinking water biofilm samples were enriched in 13c after incubation with co2. between 1.4% and 6.5% of  the biomass produced by cultures of p. putida and a drinking water biofilm during growth in complex media was apparently derived from assimilation of co2. resting  cells assimilated less co2 compared to actively growing cells, and co2 assimilation activity correlated with the amount of biomass produced during heterotrophic growth. the 14co2 assimilation assay was evaluated as a tool to examine inhibitory effects of biocides on planktonic and sessile heterotrophs (biofilms). on the basis of 14co2 assimilation activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of benzalkonium chloride was estimated to 21.1 and 127.2 mg l(-1) for planktonic and biofilm samples, respectively. the results indicate that assimilation of isotopically labelled co2 can be used as a relatively simple measure of metabolic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. co2 assimilation assays  may be used to study the effects of antimicrobial agents on growth and survival of planktonic and sessile heterotrophic organisms.

TI  == identification of the anabaena sp. strain pcc7120 cyanophycin synthetase as suitable enzyme for production of cyanophycin in gram-negative bacteria like pseudomonas putida and ralstonia eutropha.
AB  == the cyanophycin synthetase gene cpha1 encoding the major cyanophycin synthetase (cpha) of anabaena sp. strain pcc7120 was expressed in escherichia coli conferring so far the highest specific cpha activity to e. coli (6.7 nmol arginine per min and mg protein). cpha1 and cpha genes of synechocystis sp. strains pcc6803 and pcc6308 and synechococcus strain ma19 were also expressed in  wild types and polyhydroxyalkanoate-negative (pha) mutants of pseudomonas putida  and ralstonia eutropha. recombinant strains of these bacteria expressing cpha1 accumulated generally more cyanophycin (23.0 and 20.0% of cellular dry matter, cdm, respectively) than recombinants expressing any other cpha (6.8, 9.0, or 15.8% of cdm for p. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, or 14.1% of cdm for r. eutropha). furthermore, pha-negative mutants of p. putida (9.7, 10.0, 17.5, or 24.0% of cdm) and r. eutropha (8.9, 13.8, 16.0, or 22.0% of cdm) accumulated generally more cyanophycin than the corresponding pha-positive parent strains (6.8, 9.0, 15.8, and 23.0% of cdm for p. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, 14.1, or 20.0% of cdm for r. eutropha strains). recombinant strains of gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium, corynebacterium glutamicum) were not suitable for  cyanophycin production due to accumulation of less cyanophycin and retarded release of cyanophycin. pha-negative mutants of p. putida and r. eutropha expressing cpha1 of anabaena sp. strain pcc7120 are therefore preferred candidates for industrial production of cyanophycin.

TI  == cytoplasmic membrane polarization in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria grown in the absence and presence of tetracycline.
AB  == the ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to  estimate membrane polarization values. however, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. the cytoplasmic membrane polarization values  for arthrobacter sp. atcc 21908, bacillus cereus nrc 3045, pseudomonas fluorescens r2f, pseudomonas putida nrc 2986 and escherichia coli c600 bacterial  cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees c, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using  the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. at an assay temperature of 10 degrees c,  e. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for b. cereus, arthrobacter sp., p. fluorescens and p. putida. at an assay temperature of 30 degrees c, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in  the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. b. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. regardless of  the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees c. to our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also  for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.

TI  == antifouling potential of some marine organisms from india against species of bacillus and pseudomonas.
AB  == crude methanolic extracts of 37 marine organisms (16 species of flora, 21 species of fauna) were screened for antibacterial properties against 5 strains of bacteria isolated from marine environments. of these, 10 plant and 9 animal extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against at least one bacterial strain.  the extracts of 6 species were active against all the strains: i.e., stoechospermum marginatum (brown algae), cymodocea rotundata (seagrass), petrosia sp. and psammaplysilla purpurea (sponges), sinularia compressa (soft coral), and  cassiopeia sp. (jellyfish). among the plants, padina tetrastromatica (brown algae) extract exhibited significant activity (9-11-mm inhibition zone at 500 microg per 6-mm disc) against bacillus pumilus and pseudomonas vesicularis, while the extracts of petrosia, psammaplysilla, and cassiopeia were strongly active (11-13-mm inhibition zone at 500 microg per 6-mm disc) against b. circulans and p. putida. it was further confirmed that the attachment of bacterial strains on glass slides was inhibited remarkably with increasing concentrations of bioextracts of petrosia sp. and psammaplysilla purpurea. the present findings could form the basis for exploring the antibacterial potential of bioactive molecules from some of the marine organisms that exhibited moderate to strong antibacterial properties.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == analysis of endophytic bacterial communities of potato by plating and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rdna based pcr fragments.
AB  == the diversity of endophytic bacterial populations of potato (solanum tuberosum cv desiree) was assessed using a combination of dilution plating of plant macerates  followed by isolation and characterization of isolates, and direct pcr-dgge on the basis of dna extracted from plants. the culturable endophytic bacterial communities detected in potato stem bases as well as in roots were in most cases  on the order 103 to 105 cfu g?1 of fresh plant tissue. dilution plating revealed  that a range of bacterial types dominated these populations. dominant isolates fell into the a and g subgroups of the proteobacteria, as well as in the flavobacterium/cytophaga group. different representatives of the firmicutes were  also found. the most frequently isolated strains (>5% of the total) were characterized as different pseudomonas spp. (including p. aureofaciens, p. corrugata, and p. putida), agrobacterium radiobacter, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium resinovorans, using fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analysis and/or sequencing of their partial 16s ribosomal rna genes. other proteobacteria or firmicutes were also found, albeit infrequently, and mainly in  potato stem tissue. the fate of three putative potato endophytes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacillus sp., and sphingomonas paucimobilis, was monitored following their release into potato plants via injection, via root dipping, or via the soil. following stem injection, the s. maltophilia and bacillus inoculants could be tracked over time periods of, respectively, 22 and 1 day(s) by dilution plating as well as via pcr-dgge. however, only s. maltophilia  was able to colonize, and persist in, plant tissue from soil or dipped roots. s.  paucimobilis was never recovered from the plant irrespective of the mode of introduction. the diversity of the indigenous bacterial flora associated with potato was then monitored via pcr-dgge. the patterns obtained revealed the existence of bacterial communities of limited complexity, with communities from potato stems typically differing from those from stem peel and roots. evidence was obtained for the endophytic occurrence of a range of organisms falling into the a, b, and g subgroups of the proteobacteria as well as in the firmicutes. several of the sequences found matched those from isolates, suggesting that the molecular evidence reported culturable organisms. however, a number of sequences  did not have matching sequences from isolates, suggesting that non-culturable or  as-yet-uncultured endophytic organisms were being detected.

TI  == molecular detection and diversity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria isolated from geographically diverse sites.
AB  == nineteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)-degrading bacteria were isolated from environmental samples in kuwait, indonesia, thailand, and japan by enrichment with either naphthalene or phenanthrene as a sole carbon source. sequence analyses of the 16-s rrna gene indicated that at least seven genera (ralstonia, sphingomonas, burkholderia, pseudomonas, comamonas, flavobacterium, and bacillus) were present in this collection. determination of the ability of the isolates to use pah and its presumed catabolic intermediates suggests that the isolates showed multiple phenotypes in terms of utilization and degradation pathways. the large subunit of the terminal oxygenase gene (phnac) from burkholderia sp. strain rp007 hybridized to 32% (6/19) of the isolates, whilst gene probing using the large subunit of terminal oxygenase gene (pahac) from pseudomonas putida strain ous82 revealed no pahac-like genes amongst the isolates. using three degenerated primer sets (ppah-f/nr700, aj025/26, and rieskef/r), targeting a conserved region with the genes encoding the large subunit of terminal oxygenase successfully amplified material from 6 additional pah-degrading isolates. sequence analyses showed that the large subunit of terminal oxygenase in 4 isolates was highly homologous to the large subunit of naphthalene dioxygenase gene from ralstonia sp. strain u2. however, we could not  obtain any information on the oxygenase system involved in the naphthalene and/or phenathrene degradation by 7 other strains. these results suggest that pah-degrading bacteria are diverse, and that there are still many unidentified pah-degrading bacteria.

TI  == determination of the kinetic parameters of the phenol-degrading thermophile bacillus themoleovorans sp. a2.
AB  == phenolic compounds are pollutants in many wastewaters, e.g. from crude oil refineries, coal gasification plants or olive oil mills. phenol removal is a key  process for the biodegradation of pollutants at high temperatures because even low concentrations of phenol can inhibit microorganisms severely. bacillus thermoleovorans sp. a2, a recently isolated thermophilic strain (temperature optimum 65 degrees c), was investigated for its capacity to degrade phenol. the experiments revealed that growth rates were about four times higher than those of mesophilic microorganisms such as pseudomonas putida. very high specific growth rates of 2.8 h(-1) were measured at phenol concentrations of 15 mg/l, while at phenol concentrations of 100-500 mg/l growth rates were still in the range of 1 h(-1). the growth kinetics of the thermophilic bacillus thermoleovorans sp. a2 on phenol as sole carbon and energy source can be described using a three-parameter  model developed in enzyme kinetics. the yield coefficient yx/s of 0.8-1 g cell dry weight/g phenol was considerably higher than cell yields of mesophilic bacteria (yx/s 0.40-0.52 g cell dry weight/g phenol). the highest growth rate was found at ph 6. bacillus thermoleovorans sp. a2 was found to be insensitive to hydrodynamic shear stress in stirred bioreactor experiments (despite possible membrane damage caused by phenol) and flourished at an ionic strength of the medium of 0.25(-1) mol/l (equivalent to about 15-60 g nacl/l). these exceptional  properties make bacillus thermoleovorans sp. a2 an excellent candidate for technical applications.

TI  == cloning and expression of the nitrile hydratase and amidase genes from bacillus sp. br449 into escherichia coli.
AB  == a moderate thermophile, bacillus sp. br449 was previously shown to exhibit a high level of nitrile hydratase (nhase) activity when growing on high levels of acrylonitrile at 55 degrees c. in this report, we describe the cloning of a 6.1 kb sali dna fragment encoding the nhase gene cluster of br449 into escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing revealed six orfs encoding (in order), two unidentified putative proteins, amidase, nhase beta- and alpha-subunits and a small putative protein of 101 amino acids designated p12k. spacings and orientation of the coding regions as well as their gene expression in e. coli suggest that the beta-subunit, alpha-subunit, and p12k genes are co-transcribed.  analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the amidase (348 aa, mw 38.6 kda) belongs to the nitrilase-related aliphatic amidase family, and that the nhase beta- (229 aa, mw 26.5 kda) and alpha- (214 aa, mw 24.5 kda) subunits comprise a cobalt-containing member of the nhase family, which includes rhodococcus rhodochrous j1 and pseudomonas putida 5b nhases. the amidase/nhase gene cluster differs both in arrangement and composition from those described for other nhase-producing strains. when expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, the subcloned nhase genes produced significant levels of active nhase enzyme when cobalt ion was added either to the culture medium or cell extracts. presence of the p12k gene and addition of amide compounds as inducers were not required for this expression.

TI  == marine bacillus spores as catalysts for oxidative precipitation and sorption of metals.
AB  == the oxidation of soluble manganese(ii) to insoluble mn(iii,iv) oxide precipitates plays an important role in the environment. these mn oxides are known to oxidize  numerous organic and inorganic compounds, scavenge a variety of other metals on their highly charged surfaces, and serve as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration. although the oxidation of mn(ii) in most environments is believed to be bacterially-mediated, the underlying mechanisms of catalysis are not well understood. in recent years, however, the application of molecular biological approaches has provided new insights into these mechanisms. genes involved in mn  oxidation were first identified in our model organism, the marine bacillus sp. strain sg-1, and subsequently have been identified in two other phylogenetically  distinct organisms, leptothrix discophora and pseudomonas putida. in all three cases, enzymes related to multicopper oxidases appear to be involved, suggesting  that copper may play a universal role in mn(ii) oxidation. in addition to catalyzing an environmentally important process, organisms capable of mn(ii) oxidation are potential candidates for the removal, detoxification, and recovery  of metals from the environment. the mn(ii)-oxidizing spores of the marine bacillus sp. strain sg-1 show particular promise, due to their inherent physically tough nature and unique capacity to bind and oxidatively precipitate metals without having to sustain growth.

TI  == the physiological contribution of acinetobacter pcak, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of vank.
AB  == vank is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with pcak, benk, and muck, contributes to aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1. vank and pcak have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype  associated with inactivation of its homolog. furthermore, vank pcak double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. this provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. previous studies of aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. by using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. in this study, the overlapping specificity of the vank and pcak permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vank or pcak. spontaneous mutations identified in vank include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a g6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of vank structure and function. preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated pcr mutagenesis in one vank mutant gave results similar to those using lacy, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. the selection for transport mutants described here for acinetobacter may also be applicable to pseudomonas putida, where the pcak permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.

AB  == the thermostable ornithine 5-aminotransferase of a thermophile, bacillus sp. ym-2, is unique in acting on both enantiomers of ornithine, although less effectively on the d-enantiomer. we studied the stereospecificity of the enzyme for the hydrogen abstraction from c-5 of the substrate moiety and the addition and removal of the hydrogen at c-4' of the cofactor (pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate) moiety of the external schiff base intermediate in the transamination of l- and d-ornithine. l- and d-[5-3h]ornithines were prepared by  incubation of l- and d-ornithines with the enzyme in 3h2o, respectively. when the l-[5-3h]ornithine was incubated with l-ornithine 5-aminotransferase of a mesophile, bacillus sphaericus, which catalyzes the stereospecific abstraction of pro-s hydrogen from c-5 of l-ornithine, most of the tritium was released into the solvent. the d-[5-3h]ornithine also reacted with the enzyme of b. sphaericus in the presence or absence of the amino acid racemase of pseudomonas putida. tritium was released only in the presence of the racemase, which catalyzes the racemization of ornithine but does not act on c-5 of ornithine. these results show that the bacillus sp. ym-2 ornithine 5-aminotransferase stereospecifically abstracts the pro-s hydrogen from c-5 of l- and d-ornithine. when the apo form of the enzyme was incubated with pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate that was stereospecifically tritiated at c-4' and 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of l-ornithine or d-ornithine, tritium was released exclusively from (4's)-[4'-3h]pyridoxamine. therefore, addition and abstraction of hydrogen at c-4' of the cofactor moiety stereospecifically occur on the si face of the external schiff base intermediate in the overall transamination catalyzed by bacillus sp. ym-2 ornithine 5-aminotransferase irrespective of the c-2 configuration of the amino donor.

TI  == [the autoselection of neustonic forms of bacteria].
AB  == self-breeding of neuston forms of methylobacterium sp., pseudomonas putida bc-2,  alcaligenes paradoxus bc-1, bacillus thuringiensis var. israilensis bacteria as well as of a mixed culture of methylotrophs is shown possible. in spite of ability of hydrophobicity of the cell surface the suggested method of self-breeding may be used to perfect properties of larvicidal biopreparations, and bacterial preparations which intensify self-purification of water bodies.

TI  == thiosulfate oxidation by obligately heterotrophic bacteria.
AB  == thiosulfate was oxidized stoichiometrically to tetrathionate during growth on glucose byklebsiella aerogenes, bacillus globigii, b. megaterium, pseudomonas putida, two strains each ofp. fluorescens andp. aeruginosa, and anaeromonas sp. a gram-negative, rod-shaped soil isolate, pseudomonad hw, converted thiosulfate to  tetrathionate during growth on acetate. none of the organisms could use thiosulfate as sole energy source. the quantitative recovery of all the thiosulfate supplied to heterotrophic cultures either as tetrathionate alone or as tetrathionate and unused thiosulfate demonstrated that no oxidation to sulfate occurred with any of the strains tested. two strains ofescherichia coli did not oxidize thiosulfate. thiosulfate oxidation in batch culture occurred at different stages of the growth cycle for different organisms:p. putida oxidized thiosulfate during lag and early exponential phase,k. aerogenes oxidized thiosulfate at all stages of growth, andb. megaterium andaeromonas oxidized thiosulfate during late  exponential phase. the relative rates of oxidation byp. putida andk. aerogenes were apparently determined by different concentrations of thiosulfate oxidizing enzyme. thiosulfate oxidation byp. aeruginosa grown in chemostat culture was inducible, since organisms pregrown on thiosulfate-containing media oxidized thiosulfate, but those pregrown on glucose only could not oxidize thiosulfate. steady state growth yield ofp. aeruginosa in glucose-limited chemostat culture increased about 23% in the presence of 5-22 mm thiosulfate, with complete or partial concomitant oxidation to tetrathionate. the reasons for this stimulation  are unclear. the results suggest that heterotrophic oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate is widespread across several genera and may even stimulate bacterial growth in some organisms.

TI  == minimum bacterial density for bacteriophage replication: implications for significance of bacteriophages in natural ecosystems.
AB  == bacteriophage 80 alpha did not increase in number in cultures containing less than about 1.0 x 10(4) to 1.5 x 10(4) cfu of staphylococcus aureus per ml, but bacteriophage replication did occur when the number of bacteria exceeded this density, either initially or as a result of host cell multiplication. the minimum density of an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis required for an increase in the number of bacteriophage sp beta ci was about 3 x 10(4) cfu/ml. the threshold density of escherichia coli for the multiplication of bacteriophage t4  was about 7 x 10(3) cfu/ml. in the presence of montmorillonite, bacteriophage t4  did not increase in number until the e. coli population exceeded 10(4) cfu/ml. the mineralization of glucose was not affected in e. coli cultures inoculated with a low number of bacteriophage t4, but it could not be detected in cultures inoculated with a large number of phage. the numbers of bacteriophage t4 and a bacteriophage that lyses pseudomonas putida declined rapidly after being added to lake water or sewage. we suggest that bacteriophages do not affect the number or  activity of bacteria in environments where the density of the host species is below the host cell threshold of about 10(4) cfu/ml.

TI  == growth characteristics of three bacterial isolates from an arctic soil.
AB  == three bacterial isolates, a pseudomonas sp., a bacillus sp., and an arthrobacter  sp., commonly isolated from a hummocky sedge-moss meadow at devon island, n.w.t., canada, were selected for further taxonomic characterization and for a study of the effects of temperature and limiting carbon source on growth. pseudomonas m216 resembled p. putida and bacillus m153, b. carotarum. arthrobacter m51 had growth-factor requirements which were more complex than those of any named species of that genus. the temperature ranges of growth indicated that pseudomonas m216 and arthrobacter m51 were psychrotrophic while bacillus m153 was mesophilic. growth in batch culture at limiting glucose concentrations enabled the calculation of ks and y values for each isolate. these were similar to those  obtained for other organisms and pseudomonas m216 and bacillus m153 showed a high affinity for glucose. the nutritional versatility of arthrobacter m51 and its ability to grow at low temperatures and the high growth rates and affinity of pseudomonas m216 for low substrate concentrations may account for their competitive abilities in the natural environment, while the inability of bacillus m153 to grow at low temperatures may limit its activity in tundra soils.
