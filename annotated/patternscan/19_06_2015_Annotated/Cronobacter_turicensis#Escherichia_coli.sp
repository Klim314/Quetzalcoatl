TI  == development of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of cronobacter muytjensii (formerly called enterobacter sakazakii).
AB  == this study aimed to produce a polyclonal antibody against cronobacter muytjensii  (c. muytjensii, formerly called enterobacter sakazakii) and to develop an immunoassay for its detection. the optimum production of rabbit anti-c. muytjensii immunoglobulin g (igg) and chicken anti-c. muytjensii igy was reached  in weeks 8 and 9, respectively. purification of rabbit anti-c. muytjensii igg from immunized rabbit sera was accomplished using the caprylic acid and ammonium  sulfate precipitation method. as a result, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis produced two bands around 25 and 50 kda, corresponding to a light and a heavy chain, respectively. the optimized conditions for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were using rabbit anti-c. muytjensii igg (1 mug/ml) as a detection antibody and chicken anti-c. muytjensii igy (10 mug/ml) as a capture antibody. in this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed with the other genera of pathogenic bacteria tested, which included escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes. the developed assay did not show cross-reactivity with other tested species of cronobacter and enterobacter genera such as c. turicensis, c. sakazakii, e. aerogenes, e. pulveris and e. helveticus. the detection limit of sandwich elisa for c. muytjensii was found to be 2.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml. in addition, detection of c. muytjensii in infant  formula powder showed a low matrix effect on the detection curve of sandwich elisa for c. muytjensii, the detection limit being found to be 6.3 x 10(4) cfu/ml. these findings demonstrate that the developed method is able to detect all strains of c. muytjensii. hence, this elisa technique has potent application  for the rapid and accurate detection of c. muytjensii in dietary foods.

TI  == genome sequence of cronobacter sakazakii baa-894 and comparative genomic hybridization analysis with other cronobacter species.
AB  == background: the genus cronobacter (formerly called enterobacter sakazakii) is composed of five species; c. sakazakii, c. malonaticus, c. turicensis, c. muytjensii, and c. dublinensis. the genus includes opportunistic human pathogens, and the first three species have been associated with neonatal infections. the most severe diseases are caused in neonates and include fatal necrotizing enterocolitis and meningitis. the genetic basis of the diversity within the genus is unknown, and few virulence traits have been identified. methodology/principal  findings: we report here the first sequence of a member of this genus, c. sakazakii strain baa-894. the genome of cronobacter sakazakii strain baa-894 comprises a 4.4 mb chromosome (57% gc content) and two plasmids; 31 kb (51% gc) and 131 kb (56% gc). the genome was used to construct a 387,000 probe oligonucleotide tiling dna microarray covering the whole genome. comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) was undertaken on five other c. sakazakii strains, and representatives of the four other cronobacter species. among 4,382 annotated  genes inspected in this study, about 55% of genes were common to all c. sakazakii strains and 43% were common to all cronobacter strains, with 10-17% absence of genes. conclusions/significance: cgh highlighted 15 clusters of genes in c. sakazakii baa-894 that were divergent or absent in more than half of the tested strains; six of these are of probable prophage origin. putative virulence factors were identified in these prophage and in other variable regions. a number of genes unique to cronobacter species associated with neonatal infections (c. sakazakii, c. malonaticus and c. turicensis) were identified. these included a copper and silver resistance system known to be linked to invasion of the blood-brain barrier by neonatal meningitic strains of escherichia coli. in addition, genes encoding for multidrug efflux pumps and adhesins were identified  that were unique to c. sakazakii strains from outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units.
