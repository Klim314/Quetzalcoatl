TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  == a total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. a subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. at baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2)  select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. there were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters  measured at the 7 different time points. the control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of p. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. after 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly veillonella dispar. this study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.
