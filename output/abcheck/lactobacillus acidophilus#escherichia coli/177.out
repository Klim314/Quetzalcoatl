hepatoprotective effect of lactic acid bacteria, inhibitors of beta-glucuronidase production against intestinal microflora.
the hepatoprotective activity of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis hy7401, lactobacillus acidophilus csg and bifidobacterium longum hy8001), which inhibited beta-glucuronidase productivity of intestinal microflora, on t-bhp- or ccl4-induced hepatotoxicity of mice were evaluated.
these oral administration of lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as escherichia coli hgu-3.
when lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on ccl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of the ccl4 control group, respectively.
these lactic acid bacteria also showed the potent hepatoprotective effect against t-bhp-induced liver injury in mice.
the inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (ddb), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent.
among these lactic acid bacteria, l. acidophilus csg exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect.
based on these findings, we insist that an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase production in intestine, such as lactic acid bacteria, may be hepatoprotective.
