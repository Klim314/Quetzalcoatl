TI  == diverse mechanisms regulate sporulation sigma factor activity in the firmicutes.
AB  == sporulation allows bacteria to survive adverse conditions and is essential to the lifecycle of some obligate anaerobes. in bacillus subtilis, the sporulation-specific sigma factors, sigma(f), sigma(e), sigma(g), and sigma(k), activate compartment-specific transcriptional programs that drive sporulation through its morphological stages. the regulation of these sigma factors was predicted to be conserved across the firmicutes, since the regulatory proteins controlling their activation are largely conserved. however, recent studies in (pepto)clostridium difficile, clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum have revealed striking differences in the  order, activation, and function of sporulation sigma factors. these studies indicate that gene conservation does not necessarily predict gene function and that new mechanisms for controlling cell fate determination remain to be discovered in the anaerobic clostridia.

TI  == the clostridium sporulation programs: diversity and preservation of endospore differentiation.
AB  == summary: bacillus and clostridium organisms initiate the sporulation process when unfavorable conditions are detected. the sporulation process is a carefully orchestrated cascade of events at both the transcriptional and posttranslational  levels involving a multitude of sigma factors, transcription factors, proteases,  and phosphatases. like bacillus genomes, sequenced clostridium genomes contain genes for all major sporulation-specific transcription and sigma factors (spo0a,  sigh, sigf, sige, sigg, and sigk) that orchestrate the sporulation program. however, recent studies have shown that there are substantial differences in the  sporulation programs between the two genera as well as among different clostridium species. first, in the absence of a bacillus-like phosphorelay system, activation of spo0a in clostridium organisms is carried out by a number of orphan histidine kinases. second, downstream of spo0a, the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of the canonical set of four sporulation-specific sigma factors (sigma(f), sigma(e), sigma(g), and sigma(k)) display different patterns, not only compared to bacillus but also among clostridium organisms. finally, recent studies demonstrated that sigma(k), the last sigma factor to be activated according to the bacillus subtilis model, is involved in the very early stages of sporulation in clostridium acetobutylicum, c. perfringens, and c. botulinum as well as in the very late stages of spore maturation in c. acetobutylicum. despite profound differences in initiation, propagation, and orchestration of expression of spore morphogenetic components, these findings demonstrate not only the robustness of the endospore sporulation program but also the plasticity of the program to generate different complex phenotypes, some apparently regulated at the epigenetic level.

TI  == infant botulism: is there an association with thiamine deficiency?
AB  == infant botulism is an acute life-threatening condition and diagnosis is frequently delayed. therefore, the best time window to administer specific antibodies, at present the only etiology-based therapy, is often missed, entailing long periods of hospitalization in the picu. here we present a 3-month-old boy with infant botulism and respiratory failure, who quickly and favorably responded to thiamine supplementation. from the feces we isolated clostridium botulinum serotype a2. in addition to producing botulinum neurotoxin  a, this strain carried the thiaminase i gene and produced thiaminase i. accordingly, the child's feces were positive for thiaminase i activity. because c botulinum group i strains are capable of producing thiaminase i, we speculate that thiamine degradation might further aggravate the paralytic symptoms caused by botulinum neurotoxins in infant botulism. thus, supportive supplementation with thiamine could be beneficial to speed up recovery and to shorten hospitalization in some patients with infant botulism.

TI  == viability of clostridium sporogenes spores after cao hygienization of meat waste.
AB  == the occurrence of the pathogenic species c. perfringens and c. botulinum spores in animal by-products poses a potential epidemiological hazard. strong entero- and neurotoxins produced by these bacteria adversely affect human health. to inactivate pathogens present in animal by-products, waste must be subjected to various methods of sanitization. the aim of the presented study was to estimate the effect of different doses of cao on the viability of spores clostridium sporogenes in meat wastes category 3. during the research, two doses of burnt lime were added to the poultry mince meat and meat mixed with swine blood contaminated with clostridium sporogenes spore suspension. half of the samples collected for microbiological analyses were buffered to achieve the ph level ~7,  the other were examined without ph neutralization. to estimate the spore number,  10-fold dilution series in peptone water was prepared and heat-treated at 80 degrees c for 10 min. after cooling-down, one milliliter of each dilution was pour-plated onto drcm medium solidified with agar. statistical analysis were performed using the statistica software. application of 70% cao caused complete inactivation of clostridium spores in meat wastes after 48 hours. the highest temperature achieved during the experiment was 67 degrees c. rapid alkalization of the biomass resulted in increasing ph to values exceeding 12. the effect of liming was not dependent on the meat wastes composition nor cao dose. the experiment proved the efficiency of liming as a method of animal by-products sanitization. application of the obtained results may help reduce the epidemiological risk and ensure safety to people handling meat wastes at each stage of their processing and utilization.

TI  == view from the front lines: an emergency medicine perspective on clostridial infections in injection drug users.
AB  == injection drug use (idu), specifically non-intravenous "skin-popping" of heroin,  seems to provide optimal conditions for clostridial infection and toxin production. idu is therefore a major risk factor for wound botulism and clostridial necrotizing soft tissue infections (nsti) and continues to be linked  to cases of tetanus. case clusters of all 3 diseases have occurred among idus in  western u.s. and europe. medical personnel who care for the idu population must be thoroughly familiar with the clinical presentation and management of these diseases. wound botulism presents with bulbar symptoms and signs that are easily  overlooked; rapid acquisition and administration of antitoxin can prevent neuromuscular respiratory failure. in addition to clostridium perfringens, idu-related nstis can be caused by clostridium sordellii and clostridium novyi, which may share a distinct clinical presentation. early definitive nsti management, which decreases mortality, requires a low index of suspicion on the part of emergency physicians and low threshold for surgical exploration and debridement on the part of the surgeon. tetanus should be preventable in the idu  population through careful attention to vaccination status.

TI  == clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  == some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. these gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include clostridium botulinum (c2 toxin), clostridium difficile (c. difficile toxin or cdt), clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or bec), clostridium spiroforme (c. spiroforme toxin or cst), as well as bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or vip). these gut-acting proteins form an ab complex composed of adp-ribosyl transferase (a) and cell-binding (b) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. once inside the cytosol, the a components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-adp-ribosylation  of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.

TI  == cyclophilin-facilitated membrane translocation as pharmacological target to prevent intoxication of mammalian cells by binary clostridial actin adp-ribosylated toxins.
AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridium perfringens iota toxin and clostridium difficile cdt belong to the family of binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins and are composed of a binding/translocation component and a separate enzyme component. the enzyme components adp-ribosylate g-actin in the cytosol of  target cells resulting in depolymerization of f-actin, cell rounding and cell death. the binding/translocation components bind to their cell receptors and form complexes with the respective enzyme components. after receptor-mediated endocytosis, the binding/translocation components form pores in membranes of acidified endosomes and the enzyme components translocate through these pores into the cytosol. this step is facilitated by the host cell chaperone heat shock  protein 90 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases including cyclophilin a. here, we demonstrate that a large isoform of cyclophilin a, the multi-domain enzyme cyclophilin 40 (cyp40), binds to the enzyme components c2i, ia and cdta in vitro. isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a direct binding to c2i with a calculated affinity of 101 nm and to ia with an affinity of 1.01 mum. closer investigation for the prototypic c2i revealed that binding to cyp40 did not depend on its adp-ribosyltransferase activity but was stronger for unfolded c2i.  the interaction of c2i with cyp40 was also demonstrated in lysates from c2-treated cells by pull-down. treatment of cells with a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine a derivative, which still binds to and inhibits the peptidyl-prolyl  cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins, protected cells from intoxication with c2, iota and cdt toxins, offering an attractive approach for development of  novel therapeutic strategies against binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins.

TI  == tailored cyclodextrin pore blocker protects mammalian cells from clostridium difficile binary toxin cdt.
AB  == some clostridium difficile strains produce, in addition to toxins a and b, the binary toxin clostridium difficile transferase (cdt), which adp-ribosylates actin and may contribute to the hypervirulence of these strains. the separate binding and translocation component cdtb mediates transport of the enzyme component cdta  into mammalian target cells. cdtb binds to its receptor on the cell surface, cdta assembles and cdtb/cdta complexes are internalised. in acidic endosomes, cdtb mediates the delivery of cdta into the cytosol, most likely by forming a translocation pore in endosomal membranes. we demonstrate that a seven-fold symmetrical positively charged beta-cyclodextrin derivative, per-6-s-(3-aminomethyl)benzylthio-beta-cyclodextrin, which was developed earlier  as a potent inhibitor of the translocation pores of related binary toxins of bacillus anthracis, clostridium botulinum and clostridium perfringens, protects cells from intoxication with cdt. the pore blocker did not interfere with the cdta-catalyzed adp-ribosylation of actin or toxin binding to vero cells but inhibited the ph-dependent membrane translocation of cdta into the cytosol. in conclusion, the cationic beta-cyclodextrin could serve as the lead compound in a  development of novel pharmacological strategies against the cdt-producing strains of c. difficile.

TI  == detection of pathogenic clostridia in biogas plant wastes.
AB  == as the number of biogas plants has grown rapidly in the last decade, the amount of potentially contaminated wastes with pathogenic clostridium spp. has increased as well. this study reports the results from examining 203 biogas plant wastes (bgws). the following clostridium spp. with different frequencies could be isolated via a new enrichment medium (krune medium) and detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms): clostridium perfringens (58 %) then clostridium bifermentans (27  %), clostridium tertium (23 %) and clostridium butyricum (19 %), clostridium cadaveris (15 %), clostridium parapurificum (6 %), clostridium glycolicum (5 %),  clostridium baratii (4 %), clostridium sporogenes (2 %), clostridium sordellii (1 %) and clostridium subterminale (0.5 %). the mean most probable number (mpn) count of sulfite reducing bacteria was between 10(3) and 10(4)/ml, and the higher the mpn, the more pathogenic clostridium spp. were present. also, real-time pcr was used to be compared with culture method for c. perfringens, c. bifermentans,  c. butyricum, c. sporogenes/clostridium botulinum and c. sordellii. although real-time pcr was more sensitive than the culture method, both systems improve the recovery rate but in different ways and are useful to determine pathogenic clostridia in biogas plants. in conclusion, bgws could present a biohazard risk of clostridia for humans and animals.

TI  == clostridial pore-forming toxins: powerful virulence factors.
AB  == pore formation is a common mechanism of action for many bacterial toxins. more than one third of clostridial toxins are pore-forming toxins (pfts) belonging to  the beta-pft class. they are secreted as soluble monomers rich in beta-strands, which recognize a specific receptor on target cells and assemble in oligomers. then, they undergo a conformational change leading to the formation of a beta-barrel, which inserts into the lipid bilayer forming functional pore. according to their structure, clostridial beta-pfts are divided into several families. clostridial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins form large pores, which disrupt the plasma membrane integrity. they are potent virulence factors mainly involved in myonecrosis. clostridial heptameric beta-pfts (aerolysin family and staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin family) induce small pores which trigger signaling cascades leading to different cell responses according to the cell types and toxins. they are mainly responsible for intestinal diseases, like necrotic enteritis, or systemic diseases/toxic shock from intestinal origin. clostridial intracellularly active toxins exploit pore formation through the endosomal membrane to translocate the enzymatic component or domain into the cytosol. single chain protein toxins, like botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins, use hydrophobic alpha-helices to form pores, whereas clostridial binary toxins encompass binding components, which are structurally and functionally related to  beta-pfts, but which have acquired the specific activity to internalize their corresponding enzymatic components. structural analysis suggests that beta-pfts and binding components share a common evolutionary origin.

TI  == eutrophication and bacterial pathogens as risk factors for avian botulism outbreaks in wetlands receiving effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants.
AB  == due to the scarcity of water resources in the "mancha humeda" biosphere reserve,  the use of treated wastewater has been proposed as a solution for the conservation of natural threatened floodplain wetlands. in addition, wastewater treatment plants of many villages pour their effluent into nearby natural lakes.  we hypothesized that certain avian pathogens present in wastewater may cause avian mortalities which would trigger avian botulism outbreaks. with the aim of testing our hypothesis, 24 locations distributed in three wetlands, two that receive wastewater effluents and one serving as a control, were monitored during  a year. sediment, water, water bird feces, and invertebrates were collected for the detection of putative avian pathogenic escherichia coli (apec), salmonella spp., clostridium perfringens type a, and clostridium botulinum type c/d. also, water and sediment physicochemical properties were determined. overall, apec, c.  perfringens, and c. botulinum were significantly more prevalent in samples belonging to the wetlands which receive wastewater. the occurrence of a botulism  outbreak in one of the studied wetlands coincided with high water temperatures and sediment 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (bod5), a decrease in water redox potential, chlorophyll a, and sulfate levels, and an increase in water inorganic  carbon levels. the presence of c. botulinum in bird feces before the onset of the outbreak indicates that carrier birds exist and highlights the risk of botulinum  toxin production in their carcasses if they die by other causes such as bacterial diseases, which are more probable in wastewater wetlands.

TI  == relationship between gastrointestinal dysbiosis and clostridium botulinum in dairy cows.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract is a balanced ecosystem that can get out of balance and predisposed to clostridial diseases or other pathological conditions. the objective of the present study was to evaluate the gut microbiota in dairy cows suffering from chronic botulism. cows were investigated for clostridium (c.) botulinum in faeces and rumen fluids. in order to study the relationship between  botulism and gastrointestinal microbiota, faeces and rumen fluid were tested for  bacterial composition using conventional microbiological culture techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). protozoa were analyzed in rumen fluid  microscopically. the presence of c. botulinum was associated with specific changes in the faecal microbiota, especially a significant reduction of total aerobic bacteria, total anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, clostridium perfringens  and yeast and fungi. also c. botulinum positive rumen fluid had significantly more bacteroides spp., c. histolyticum group, alfa- proteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria, and sulfate-reducing bacteria; as well as significantly fewer euryaracheota, and the protozoa epidinium spp. dasytricha spp., diplodiniinae spp. and ophryoscolex spp. in conclusion, c. botulinum is common in dairy cows in germany but the incidence of botulism is associated with microbial  changes and composition in the gastrointestinal tract. bacteria, yeast and protozoa appear to be crucial in the colonization process; however, the chronology of these events and role of each microbial group needs further evaluation.

TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium perfringens growth by potassium lactate during an extended cooling of cooked uncured ground turkey breasts.
AB  == the u.s. department of agriculture's food safety and inspection service compliance guideline known as appendix b specifies chilling time and temperature  limits for cured and uncured meat products to inhibit growth of spore-forming bacteria, particularly clostridium perfringens. sodium lactate and potassium lactate inhibit toxigenic growth of clostridium botulinum, and inhibition of c. perfringens has been reported. in this study, a cocktail of spores of three c. perfringens strains (atcc 13124, atcc 12915, and atcc 12916) were inoculated into 100-g samples of ground skinless, boneless turkey breast formulated to represent  deli-style turkey breast. three treatment groups were supplemented with 0 (control), 1, or 2% potassium lactate (pure basis), cooked to 71 degrees c, and assayed for c. perfringens growth during 10 or 12 h of linear cooling to 4 degrees c. in control samples, populations of c. perfringens increased 3.8 to 4.7 log cfu/g during the two chilling protocols. the 1% potassium lactate treatment supported only a 2.5- to 2.7-log increase, and the 2% potassium lactate treatment limited growth to a 0.56- to 0.70-log increase. when compared with the control, 2% potassium lactate retarded growth by 2.65 and 4.21 log cfu/g for the 10- and 12-h cooling protocols, respectively. these results confirm that the addition of  2% potassium lactate inhibits growth of c. perfringens and that potassium lactate can be used as an alternative to sodium nitrite for safe extended cooling of uncured meats.

TI  == evaluation of cp chromo select agar for the enumeration of clostridium perfringens from water.
AB  == the european directive on drinking water quality has included mcp agar as the reference method for recovering clostridium perfringens from drinking waters. in  the present study, three media (mcp, tscf and cp chromo select agar) were evaluated for recovery of c. perfringens in different surface water samples. out  of 139 water samples, using a membrane filtration technique, 131 samples (94.2%)  were found to be presumptively positive for c. perfringens in at least one of the culture media. green colored colonies on cp chromo select agar (ccp agar) were counted as presumptive c. perfringens isolates. out of 483 green colonies on ccp  agar, 96.3% (465 strains, indole negative) were identified as c. perfringens, and 15 strains (3.1%) were indole positive and were identified as clostridium sordellii, clostridium bifermentans or clostridium tetani. only 3 strains (0.6%)  gave false positive results and were identified as clostridium fallax, clostridium botulinum, and clostridium tertium. variance analysis of the data obtained shows statistically no significant differences in the counts obtained between media employed in this work. the mcp method is very onerous for routine screening and bacterial colonies could not be used for further biochemical testing. the colonies on ccp and tscf were easy to count and subculture for confirmation tests. tscf detects sulfite-reducing clostridia, including species other than c. perfringens, and in some cases excessive blackening of the agar frustrated counting of the colonies. if the contamination was too high, tscf did  not consistently produce black colonies and as a consequence, the colonies were white and gave false negative results. on the other hand, the identification of typical and atypical colonies isolated from all media demonstrated that ccp agar  was the most useful medium for c. perfringens recovery in water samples.

TI  == genetic characteristics of toxigenic clostridia and toxin gene evolution.
AB  == clostridia comprise a heterogenous group of environmental bacteria containing 15  pathogenic species, which produce the most potent toxins. the origin of toxins is still enigmatic. it is hypothesized that toxins exhibiting an enzymatic activity  have derived from hydrolytic enzymes, which are abundantly secreted by these bacteria, and that pore-forming toxins have evolved from an ancestor transmembrane protein. the presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridium species and the variability of some toxin genes support horizontal toxin gene transfer and subsequent independent evolution from strain to strain. clostridium perfringens toxin genes involved in myonecrosis, mainly alpha toxin and perfringolysin genes, are chromosomally located, whereas toxin genes responsible for intestinal and food borne diseases are localized on plasmids except the enterotoxin gene which can be located either on the chromosome or plasmids. the distribution of these plasmids containing one or several toxin genes accounts for the diverse c. perfringens toxinotypes. clostridium difficile  strains show a high genetic variability. but in contrast to c. perfringens, toxin genes are clustered in pathogenicity locus located on chromosome. the presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridial species like clostridium sordellii, clostridium novyi, and c. perfringens supports interspecies mobilization of this  locus. the multiple c. difficile toxinotypes based on toxin gene variants possibly reflect strain adaptation to the intestinal environment. botulinum toxin genes also show a high level of genetic variation. they have a diverse genetic localization including chromosome, plasmid or phage, and are spread in various clostridium species (clostridium botulinum groups, clostridium argentinense, clostridium butyricum, clostridium baratii). exchange of toxin genes not only include transfers between clostridium species but also between clostridium and other bacterial species as well as eukaryotic cells as supported by the wide distribution of related pore-forming toxins of the aerolysin family in various clostridial and non-clostridial species, animal, mushroom and plant.

TI  == phospholipase c produced by clostridium botulinum types c and d: comparison of gene, enzymatic, and biological activities with those of clostridium perfringens  alpha-toxin.
AB  == clostridium botulinum type c and d strains recently have been found to produce plc on egg yolk agar plates. to characterize the gene, enzymatic and biological activities of c. botulinum plcs (cb-plcs), the cb-plc genes from 8 strains were sequenced, and 1 representative gene was cloned and expressed as a recombinant protein. the enzymatic and hemolytic activities of the recombinant cb-plc were measured and compared with those of the clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. each of the eight cb-plc genes encoded a 399 amino acid residue protein preceded by a  27 residue signal peptide. the protein consists of 2 domains, the n- and c-domains, and the overall amino acid sequence identity between cb-plc and alpha-toxin was greater than 50%, suggesting that cb-plc is homologous to the alpha-toxin. the key residues in the n-domain were conserved, whereas those in the c-domain which are important in membrane interaction were different than in the alpha-toxin. as expected, cb-plc could hydrolyze egg yolk phospholipid, p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine, and sphingomyelin, and also exhibited hemolytic activity;however, its activities were about 4- to over 200-fold lower than those  of alpha-toxin. although cb-plc showed weak enzymatic and biological activities,  it is speculated that cb-plc might play a role in the pathogenicity of botulism or for bacterial survival.

TI  == cd44 promotes intoxication by the clostridial iota-family toxins.
AB  == various pathogenic clostridia produce binary protein toxins associated with enteric diseases of humans and animals. separate binding/translocation (b) components bind to a protein receptor on the cell surface, assemble with enzymatic (a) component(s), and mediate endocytosis of the toxin complex. ultimately there is translocation of a component(s) from acidified endosomes into the cytosol, leading to destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. our results revealed that cd44, a multifunctional surface protein of mammalian cells, facilitates intoxication by the iota family of clostridial binary toxins. specific antibody against cd44 inhibited cytotoxicity of the prototypical clostridium perfringens iota toxin. versus cd44(+) melanoma cells, those lacking  cd44 bound less toxin and were dose-dependently resistant to c. perfringens iota, as well as clostridium difficile and clostridium spiroforme iota-like, toxins. purified cd44 specifically interacted in vitro with iota and iota-like, but not related clostridium botulinum c2, toxins. furthermore, cd44 knockout mice were resistant to iota toxin lethality. collective data reveal an important role for cd44 during intoxication by a family of clostridial binary toxins.

AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == multiplex detection of protein toxins using maldi-tof-tof tandem mass spectrometry: application in unambiguous toxin detection from bioaerosol.
AB  == protein toxins, such as botulinum neurotoxins (bonts), clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin (etx), staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), shiga toxin (stx), and plant toxin ricin, are involved in a number of diseases and are considered as potential agents for bioterrorism and warfare. from a bioterrorism and warfare perspective, these agents are likely to cause maximum damage to a civilian or military population through an inhalational route of exposure and aerosol is considered the envisaged mode of delivery. unambiguous detection of toxin from aerosol is of paramount importance, both for bringing mitigation protocols into operation and for implementation of effective medical countermeasures, in case a  "biological cloud" is seen over a population. a multiplex, unambiguous, and qualitative detection of protein toxins is reported here using tandem mass spectrometry with maldi-tof-tof. the methodology involving simple sample processing steps was demonstrated to identify toxins (etx, clostridium perfringes phospholipase c, and seb) from blind spiked samples. the novel directed search approach using a list of unique peptides was used to identify toxins from a complex protein mixture. the bioinformatic analysis of seven protein toxins for elucidation of unique peptides with conservation status across all known sequences provides a high confidence for detecting toxins originating from any geographical location and source organism. use of tandem ms data with peptide sequence information increases the specificity of the method. a prototype for generation of aerosol using a nebulizer and collection using a cyclone collector  was used to provide a proof of concept for unambiguous detection of toxin from aerosol using precursor directed tandem mass spectrometry combined with protein database searching. etx prototoxin could be detected from aerosol at 0.2 ppb concentration in aerosol.

AB  == cationic beta-cyclodextrin derivatives were recently introduced as highly effective, potentially universal blockers of three binary bacterial toxins: anthrax toxin of bacillus anthracis, c2 toxin of clostridium botulinum, and iota  toxin of clostridium perfringens. the binary toxins are made of two separate components: the enzymatic a component, which acts on certain intracellular targets, and the binding/translocation b component, which forms oligomeric channels in the target cell membrane. here we studied the voltage and salt dependence of the rate constants of binding and dissociation reactions of two structurally different beta-cyclodextrins (amprbetacd and ambntbetacd) in the pa(63), c2iia, and ib channels (b components of anthrax, c2, and iota toxins, respectively). with all three channels, the blocker carrying extra hydrophobic aromatic groups on the thio-alkyl linkers of positively charged amino groups, ambntbetacd, demonstrated significantly stronger binding compared with amprbetacd. this effect is seen as an increased residence time of the blocker in  the channels, whereas the time between blockages characterizing the binding reaction on-rate stays practically unchanged. surprisingly, the voltage sensitivity, expressed as a slope of the logarithm of the blocker residence time  as a function of voltage, turned out to be practically the same for all six cases studied, suggesting structural similarities among the three channels. also, the more-effective ambntbetacd blocker shows weaker salt dependence of the binding and dissociation rate constants compared with amprbetacd. by estimating the relative contributions of the applied transmembrane field, long-range coulomb, and salt-concentration-independent, short-range forces, we found that the latter  represent the leading interaction, which accounts for the high efficiency of blockage. in a search for the putative groups in the channel lumen that are responsible for the short-range forces, we performed measurements with the f427a  mutant of pa(63), which lacks the functionally important phenylalanine clamp. we  found that the on-rates of the blockage were virtually conserved, but the residence times and, correspondingly, the binding constants dropped by more than  an order of magnitude, which also reduced the difference between the efficiencies of the two blockers.

TI  == clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin recognizes the gm1a-trka complex.
AB  == clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin is the major virulence factor in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. alpha-toxin is a 43-kda protein with two structural domains; the n-domain contains the catalytic site and coordinates the divalent metal ions, and the c-domain is a membrane-binding site. the role of the exposed  loop region (72-93 residues) in the n-domain, however, has been unclear. here we  show that this loop contains a ganglioside binding motif (h ... sxwy ... g) that  is the same motif seen in botulinum neurotoxin and directly binds to a specific conformation of the ganglioside neu5acalpha2-3(galbeta1-3galnacbeta1-4)galbeta1-4glcbeta1cer (gm1a) through a carbohydrate moiety. confocal microscopy analysis using fluorescently labeled bodipy-gm1a revealed that the toxin colocalized with gm1a and induced clustering  of gm1a on the cell membranes. alpha-toxin was only slightly toxic in beta1,4-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase knock-out mice, which lack the a-series gangliosides that contain gm1a, but was highly toxic in alpha2,8-sialyltransferase knock-out mice, which lack both b-series and c-series  gangliosides, similar to the control mice. moreover, experiments with site-directed mutants indicated that trp-84 and tyr-85 in the exposed alpha-toxin loop play an important role in the interaction with gm1a and subsequent activation of trka. these results suggest that binding of alpha-toxin to gm1a facilitates the activation of the trka receptor and induces a signal transduction cascade that promotes the release of chemokines. therefore, we conclude that gm1a is the primary cellular receptor for alpha-toxin, which can be a potential target for drug developed against this pathogen.

TI  == prophage carriage and diversity within clinically relevant strains of clostridium difficile.
AB  == prophages are encoded in most genomes of sequenced clostridium difficile strains. they are key components of the mobile genetic elements and, as such, are likely to influence the biology of their host strains. the majority of these phages are  not amenable to propagation, and therefore the development of a molecular marker  is a useful tool with which to establish the extent and diversity of c. difficile prophage carriage within clinical strains. to design markers, several candidate genes were analyzed including structural and holin genes. the holin gene is the only gene present in all sequenced phage genomes, conserved at both terminals, with a variable mid-section. this allowed us to design two sets of degenerate pcr primers specific to c. difficile myoviruses and siphoviruses. subsequent pcr analysis of 16 clinical c. difficile ribotypes showed that 15 of them are myovirus positive, and 2 of them are also siphovirus positive. antibiotic induction and transmission electron microscope analysis confirmed the molecular prediction of myoviruses and/or siphovirus presence. phylogenetic analysis of the holin sequences identified three groups of c. difficile phages, two within the myoviruses and a divergent siphovirus group. the marker also produced tight groups within temperate phages that infect other taxa, including clostridium perfringens, clostridium botulinum, and bacillus spp., which suggests the potential application of the holin gene to study prophage carriage in other bacteria. this study reveals the high incidence of prophage carriage in clinically relevant strains of c. difficile and correlates the molecular data to  the morphological observation.

TI  == fk506-binding protein 51 interacts with clostridium botulinum c2 toxin and fk506  inhibits membrane translocation of the toxin in mammalian cells.
AB  == the binary clostridium botulinum c2 toxin consists of the binding/translocation component c2iia and the separate enzyme component c2i. c2iia delivers c2i into the cytosol of eukaryotic target cells where c2i adp-ribosylates actin. after receptor-mediated endocytosis of the c2iia/c2i complex, c2iia forms pores in membranes of acidified early endosomes and unfolded c2i translocates through the  pores into the cytosol. membrane translocation of c2i is facilitated by the activities of host cell chaperone hsp90 and the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (ppiase) cyclophilin a. here, we demonstrated that hsp90 co-precipitates with c2i from lysates of c2 toxin-treated cells and identified the fk506-binding protein (fkbp) 51 as a novel interaction partner of c2i in vitro and in intact mammalian cells. prompted by this finding, we used the specific pharmacological inhibitor fk506 to investigate whether the ppiase activity of fkbps plays a role during membrane translocation of c2 toxin. treatment of cells with fk506 protected cultured cells from intoxication with c2  toxin. moreover, fk506 inhibited the ph-dependent translocation of c2i across membranes into the cytosol but did not interfere with the enzyme activity of c2i  or binding of c2 toxin to cells. furthermore, fk506 treatment delayed intoxication with the related binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins from clostridium perfringens (iota toxin) and clostridium difficile (cdt) but not with the rho-glucosylating clostridium difficile toxin a (tcda). in conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that clostridial binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins share a specific fkbp-dependent translocation mechanism during their uptake into mammalian cells.

TI  == identification of the cellular receptor of clostridium spiroforme toxin.
AB  == clostridium spiroforme produces the binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxin cst (c. spiroforme toxin), which has been proposed to be responsible for diarrhea, enterocolitis, and eventually death, especially in rabbits. here we report on the recombinant production of the enzyme component (csta) and the binding component (cstb) of c. spiroforme toxin in bacillus megaterium. by using the recombinant toxin components, we show that cst enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (lsr), which has been recently identified as the host cell receptor of the binary toxins clostridium difficile transferase (cdt) and clostridium perfringens iota toxin. microscopic studies revealed that cst, but not the related clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, colocalized with lsr during toxin uptake and traffic to endosomal compartments. our findings indicate that cst shares lsr with c. difficile cdt and c. perfringens iota toxin as a host cell surface receptor.

TI  == life-threatening clostridial infections.
AB  == life-threatening soft tissue infections caused by clostridium species have been described in the medical literature for hundreds of years largely because of their fulminant nature, distinctive clinical presentations and complex management issues. the clostridium species perfringens, septicum and histolyticum are the principal causes of trauma-associated gas gangrene and their incidence increases  dramatically in times of war, hurricanes, earthquakes and other mass casualty conditions. recently, there has also been an increased incidence of spontaneous gas gangrene caused by clostridium septicum in association with gastrointestinal  abnormalities and neutropenia. similarly, over the last 15 years there has been increased recognition of a toxic shock-like syndrome associated with clostridium  sordellii in individuals skin-popping black tar heroin, in women undergoing childbirth or other gynecologic procedures including medically-induced abortion.  like their cousins clostridium tetanus and clostridium botulinum, the pathogenesis of these clostridial infections is largely the consequence of potent exotoxin production. strategies to inhibit toxin production, neutralize circulating toxins and prevent their interaction with cells of the innate immune  response are sorely needed. recent studies have elucidated novel targets that may hold promise for newer therapeutic modalities.

AB  == bacterial spores are the most resistant form of life and have been a major threat to public health and food safety. nonthermal atmospheric gas discharge plasma is  a novel sterilization method that leaves no chemical residue. in our study, a helium radio-frequency cold plasma jet was used to examine its sporicidal effect  on selected strains of bacillus and clostridium. the species tested included bacillus subtilis, bacillus stearothermophilus, clostridium sporogenes, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, and clostridium botulinum type a  and type e. the plasmas were effective in inactivating selected bacillus and clostridia spores with d values (decimal reduction time) ranging from 2 to 8 min. among all spores tested, c. botulinum type a and c. sporogenes were significantly more resistant to plasma inactivation than other species. observations by phase contrast microscopy showed that b. subtilis spores were severely damaged by plasmas and the majority of the treated spores were unable to initiate the germination process. there was no detectable fragmentation of the dna when the spores were treated for up to 20 min. the release of dipicolinic acid was observed almost immediately after the plasma treatment, indicating the spore envelope damage could occur quickly resulting in dipicolinic acid release and the reduction of spore resistance.

TI  == tailored ss-cyclodextrin blocks the translocation pores of binary exotoxins from  c. botulinum and c. perfringens and protects cells from intoxication.
AB  == background: clostridium botulinum c2 toxin and clostridium perfringens iota toxin are binary exotoxins, which adp-ribosylate actin in the cytosol of mammalian cells and thereby destroy the cytoskeleton. c2 and iota toxin consists of two individual proteins, an enzymatic active (a-) component and a separate receptor binding and translocation (b-) component. the latter forms a complex with the a-component on the surface of target cells and after receptor-mediated endocytosis, it mediates the translocation of the a-component from acidified endosomal vesicles into the cytosol. to this end, the b-components form heptameric pores in endosomal membranes, which serve as translocation channels for the a-components. methodology/principal findings: here we demonstrate that a  7-fold symmetrical positively charged ss-cyclodextrin derivative, per-6-s-(3-aminomethyl)benzylthio-ss-cyclodextrin, protects cultured cells from intoxication with c2 and iota toxins in a concentration-dependent manner starting at low micromolar concentrations. we discovered that the compound inhibited the ph-dependent membrane translocation of the a-components of both toxins in intact  cells. consistently, the compound strongly blocked transmembrane channels formed  by the b-components of c2 and iota toxin in planar lipid bilayers in vitro. with  c2 toxin, we consecutively ruled out all other possible inhibitory mechanisms showing that the compound did not interfere with the binding of the toxin to the  cells or with the enzyme activity of the a-component. conclusions/significance: the described ss-cyclodextrin derivative was previously identified as one of the  most potent inhibitors of the binary lethal toxin of bacillus anthracis both in vitro and in vivo, implying that it might represent a broad-spectrum inhibitor of binary pore-forming exotoxins from pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == clostron-mediated engineering of clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium is a diverse assemblage of gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the  biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as clostridium  acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinkii, clostridium thermocellum, and clostridium phytofermentans. the prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. the historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies  for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by clostron technology. the clostron uses a retargeted group ii intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert dna into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo dna delivery. the procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.

TI  == membrane translocation of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins from clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens is facilitated by cyclophilin a and hsp90.
AB  == some hypervirulent strains of clostridium difficile produce the binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxin c. difficile transferase (cdt) in addition to rho-glucosylating toxins a and b. it has been suggested that the presence of cdt  increases the severity of c. difficile-associated diseases, including pseudomembranous colitis. cdt contains a binding and translocation component, cdtb, that mediates the transport of the separate enzyme component cdta into the  cytosol of target cells, where cdta modifies actin. here we investigated the mechanism of cellular cdt uptake and found that bafilomycin a1 protects cultured  epithelial cells from intoxication with cdt, implying that cdta is translocated from acidified endosomal vesicles into the cytosol. consistently, cdta is translocated across the cytoplasmic membranes into the cytosol when cell-bound cdt is exposed to acidic medium. radicicol and cyclosporine a, inhibitors of the  heat shock protein hsp90 and cyclophilins, respectively, protected cells from intoxication with cdt but not from intoxication with toxins a and b. moreover, both inhibitors blocked the ph-dependent membrane translocation of cdta, strongly suggesting that hsp90 and cyclophilin are crucial for this process. in contrast,  the inhibitors did not interfere with the adp-ribosyltransferase activity, receptor binding, or endocytosis of the toxin. we obtained comparable results with the closely related iota-toxin from clostridium perfringens. moreover, cdta  and ia, the enzyme component of iota-toxin, specifically bound to immobilized hsp90 and cyclophilin a in vitro. in combination with our recently obtained data  on the c2 toxin from c. botulinum, these results imply a common hsp90/cyclophilin a-dependent translocation mechanism for the family of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins.

TI  == the agr-like quorum-sensing system regulates sporulation and production of enterotoxin and beta2 toxin by clostridium perfringens type a non-food-borne human gastrointestinal disease strain f5603.
AB  == clostridium perfringens type a strains producing enterotoxin (cpe) cause one of the most common bacterial food-borne illnesses, as well as many cases of non-food-borne human gastrointestinal disease. recent studies have shown that an  agr-like quorum-sensing system controls production of chromosomally encoded alpha-toxin and perfringolysin o by c. perfringens, as well as sporulation by clostridium botulinum and clostridium sporogenes. the current study explored whether the agr-like quorum-sensing system also regulates sporulation and production of two plasmid-encoded toxins (cpe and beta2 toxin) that may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-food-borne human gastrointestinal disease strain f5603. an isogenic agrb null mutant was inhibited for production of beta2  toxin during vegetative growth and in sporulating culture, providing the first evidence that, in c. perfringens, this system can control production of plasmid-encoded toxins as well as chromosomally encoded toxins. this mutant also  showed reduced production of alpha-toxin and perfringolysin o during vegetative growth. importantly, when cultured in sporulation medium, the mutant failed to efficiently form spores and was blocked for cpe production. complementation partially or fully reversed all phenotypic changes in the mutant, confirming that they were specifically due to inactivation of the agr locus. western blots suggest that this loss of sporulation and sporulation-specific cpe production for the agrb null mutant involves, at least in part, agr-mediated regulation of production of spo0a and alternative sigma factors, which are essential for c. perfringens sporulation.

TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.

TI  == clostridial binary toxins: iota and c2 family portraits.
AB  == there are many pathogenic clostridium species with diverse virulence factors that include protein toxins. some of these bacteria, such as c. botulinum, c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. spiroforme, cause enteric problems in animals as well as humans. these often fatal diseases can partly be attributed to binary  protein toxins that follow a classic ab paradigm. within a targeted cell, all clostridial binary toxins destroy filamentous actin via mono-adp-ribosylation of  globular actin by the a component. however, much less is known about b component  binding to cell-surface receptors. these toxins share sequence homology amongst themselves and with those produced by another gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium also commonly associated with soil and disease: bacillus anthracis. this review focuses upon the iota and c2 families of clostridial binary toxins and includes: (1) basics of the bacterial source; (2) toxin biochemistry; (3) sophisticated cellular uptake machinery; and (4) host-cell responses following toxin-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton. in summary, these protein toxins aid diverse enteric species within the genus clostridium.

TI  == endocytosis and toxicity of clostridial binary toxins depend on a clathrin-independent pathway regulated by rho-gdi.
AB  == clostridial binary toxins, such as clostridium perfringens iota and clostridium botulinum c2, are composed of a binding protein (ib and c2ii respectively) that recognizes distinct membrane receptors and mediates internalization of a catalytic protein (ia and c2-i respectively) with adp-ribosyltransferase activity that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. we show here that the endocytic pathway followed by these toxins is independent of clathrin but requires the activity of  dynamin and is regulated by rho-gdi. this endocytic pathway is similar to a recently characterized clathrin-independent pathway followed by the interleukin-2 (il2) receptor. we found indeed that ib and c2ii colocalized intracellularly with the il2 receptor but not the transferrin receptor after different times of endocytosis. accordingly, the intracellular effects of iota and c2 on the cytoskeleton were inhibited by inactivation of dynamin or by rho-gdi whereas inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis had no protective effect.

AB  == reasons for performing study: while previous studies have demonstrated an association between equine grass sickness (egs) and the presence of clostridium botulinum within ileal contents and faeces, no such associations with other intestinal-derived anaerobic bacteria have been extensively investigated. hypothesis: the prevalence of c. perfringens in the ileal contents and faeces of  egs horses is greater than control horses; the detection of c. perfringens in faeces by elisa could be diagnostically beneficial in a clinical setting. methods: the prevalence of c. perfringens in faeces from egs horses and healthy grazing control horses was determined by both selective culture and elisa to permit both validation of the elisa and inter-group comparisons. additionally, the prevalence of c. perfringens (elisa) in ileal contents from egs horses was compared with that for control horses with nongastrointestinal disease. finally,  the prevalence of c. perfringens (elisa) in faeces from egs cases was compared with that from both horses with which they shared pasture at the time of disease  onset and non-egs colic horses. results: when compared with culture, the elisa had a sensitivity and specificity of 86 and 98%, respectively. the prevalence of  c. perfringens in faeces as determined by both culture and elisa was significantly higher (p<0.001) for egs horses (7/9 and 15/37, respectively) than  for healthy grazing controls (0/60 and 1/74, respectively). the prevalence of c.  perfringens in ileal contents from egs horses (5/10) was greater than that for horses with nongastrointestinal disease (1/12) at a level that approached significance (p = 0.056). egs cases had a significantly greater prevalence of c.  perfringens in faeces (15/37) than co-grazing horses (1/18) and colic (1/16) horses. the specificity (93%) and ppv (94%) of the detection of c. perfringens by elisa on faecal samples in relation to disease status (egs compared with colic horses) was good. sensitivity (41%) and npv (39%) were poor. conclusions and potential relevance: the use of a commercial elisa to detect faecal c. perfringens may be diagnostically beneficial when differentiating egs cases from  colic cases, although further work is required to fully evaluate its potential.

TI  == regulation of neurotoxin production and sporulation by a putative agrbd signaling system in proteolytic clostridium botulinum.
AB  == a significant number of genome sequences of clostridium botulinum and related species have now been determined. in silico analysis of these data revealed the presence of two distinct agr loci (agr-1 and agr-2) in all group i strains, each  encoding putative proteins with similarity to agrb and agrd of the well-studied staphylococcus aureus agr quorum sensing system. in s. aureus, a small diffusible autoinducing peptide is generated from agrd in a membrane-located processing event that requires agrb. here the characterization of both agr loci in the group i strain c. botulinum atcc 3502 and of their homologues in a close relative, clostridium sporogenes ncimb 10696, is reported. in c. sporogenes ncimb 10696, agr-1 and agr-2 appear to form transcriptional units that consist of agrb, agrd,  and flanking genes of unknown function. several of these flanking genes are conserved in clostridium perfringens. in agreement with their proposed role in quorum sensing, both loci were maximally expressed during late-exponential-phase  growth. modulation of agrb expression in c. sporogenes was achieved using antisense rna, whereas in c. botulinum, insertional agrd mutants were generated using clostron technology. in comparison to the wild-type strains, these strains  exhibited drastically reduced sporulation and, for c. botulinum, also reduced production of neurotoxin, suggesting that both phenotypes are controlled by quorum sensing. interestingly, while agr-1 appeared to control sporulation, agr-2 appeared to regulate neurotoxin formation.

AB  == dipicolinic acid (dpa) is a major component of bacterial endospores, comprising 5-15% of the spore dry weight, and is important for spore stability and resistance properties. the biosynthetic precursor to dpa, dihydro-dipicolinic acid (dhdpa), is produced by dhdpa synthase within the lysine biosynthesis pathway. in bacillus subtilis, and most other bacilli and clostridia, dhdpa is oxidized to dpa by the products of the spovf operon. analysis of the genomes of the clostridia in cluster i, including the pathogens clostridium perfringens, clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, has shown that no spovf orthologues exist in these organisms. dpa synthase was purified from extracts of sporulating  c. perfringens cells. peptide sequencing identified an electron transfer flavoprotein, etfa, in this purified protein fraction. a c. perfringens strain with etfa inactivated is blocked in late stage sporulation and produces < or = 11% of wild-type dpa levels. c. perfringens etfa was expressed in and purified from escherichia coli, and this protein catalysed dpa formation in vitro. the sequential production of dhdpa and dpa in c. perfringens appears to be catalysed  by dhdpa synthase followed by etfa. genome sequence data and the taxonomy of spore-forming species suggest that this may be the ancestral mechanism for dpa synthesis.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxin cdt induces formation of microtubule-based protrusions and increases adherence of bacteria.
AB  == clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous  colitis by production of the rho gtpase-glucosylating toxins a and b. recently emerging hypervirulent clostridium difficile strains additionally produce the binary adp-ribosyltransferase toxin cdt (clostridium difficile transferase), which adp-ribosylates actin and inhibits actin polymerization. thus far, the role of cdt as a virulence factor is not understood. here we report by using time-lapse- and immunofluorescence microscopy that cdt and other binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, including clostridium botulinum c2 toxin and clostridium perfringens iota toxin, induce redistribution of microtubules and formation of long (up to >150 microm) microtubule-based protrusions at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. the toxins increase the length of decoration of microtubule plus-ends by eb1/3, clip-170 and clip-115 proteins and  cause redistribution of the capture proteins clasp2 and acf7 from microtubules at the cell cortex into the cell interior. the cdt-induced microtubule protrusions form a dense meshwork at the cell surface, which wrap and embed bacterial cells,  thereby largely increasing the adherence of clostridia. the study describes a novel type of microtubule structure caused by less efficient microtubule capture  and offers a new perspective for the pathogenetic role of cdt and other binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins in host-pathogen interactions.

AB  == clostridia produce the highest number of toxins of any type of bacteria and are involved in severe diseases in humans and other animals. most of the clostridial  toxins are pore-forming toxins responsible for gangrenes and gastrointestinal diseases. among them, perfringolysin has been extensively studied and it is the paradigm of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, whereas clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin and clostridium septicum alpha-toxin, which are related to aerolysin, are the prototypes of clostridial toxins that form small pores. other  toxins active on the cell surface possess an enzymatic activity, such as phospholipase c and collagenase, and are involved in the degradation of specific  cell-membrane or extracellular-matrix components. three groups of clostridial toxins have the ability to enter cells: large clostridial glucosylating toxins, binary toxins and neurotoxins. the binary and large clostridial glucosylating toxins alter the actin cytoskeleton by enzymatically modifying the actin monomers and the regulatory proteins from the rho family, respectively. clostridial neurotoxins proteolyse key components of neuroexocytosis. botulinum neurotoxins inhibit neurotransmission at neuromuscular junctions, whereas tetanus toxin targets the inhibitory interneurons of the cns. the high potency of clostridial toxins results from their specific targets, which have an essential cellular function, and from the type of modification that they induce. in addition, clostridial toxins are useful pharmacological and biological tools.

TI  == the long-lived nature of clostridium perfringens iota toxin in mammalian cells induces delayed apoptosis.
AB  == mono-adp ribosylation of actin by bacterial toxins, such as clostridium perfringens iota or clostridium botulinum c2 toxins, results in rapid depolymerization of actin filaments and cell rounding. here we report that treatment of african green monkey kidney (vero) cells with iota toxin resulted in delayed caspase-dependent death. unmodified actin did not reappear in toxin-treated cells, and enzyme-active toxin was detectable in the cytosol for at least 24 h. c2 toxin showed comparable, long-lived effects in cells, while a c2 toxin control lacking adp-ribosyltransferase activity did not induce cell death.  to address whether the remarkable stability of the iota and c2 toxins in cytosol  was crucial for inducing cell death, we treated cells with c/spvb, the catalytic  domain of salmonella enterica spvb. although c/spvb also mono-adp ribosylates actin as do the iota and c2 toxins, cells treated with a cell-permeating c/spvb fusion toxin became rounded but recovered and remained viable. moreover, unmodified actin reappeared in these cells, and adp-ribosyltransferase activity due to c/spvb was not detectable in the cytosol after 24 h, a result most likely  due to degradation of c/spvb. repeated application of c/spvb prevented recovery of cells and reappearance of unmodified actin. in conclusion, a complete but transient adp ribosylation of actin was not sufficient to trigger apoptosis, implying that long-term stability of actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, such as iota  and c2, in the cytosol is crucial for inducing delayed, caspase-dependent cell death.

TI  == rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  == aim: to develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (rdb) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. methods: the 12 intestinal pathogens tested were salmonella spp., brucella spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, clostridium botulinum, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, vibrio parahaemolyticus, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the two universal primers were  designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16s and 23s rdna genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved rdb assay. results: the methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 cfus. the consistent detection rate of the improved rdb assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. conclusion: the hybridization results indicated that the improved rdb assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.

TI  == erythrophore cell response to food-associated pathogenic bacteria: implications for detection.
AB  == cell-based biosensors have been proposed for use as function-based detectors of toxic agents. we report the use of betta splendens chromatophore cells, specifically erythrophore cells, for detection of food-associated pathogenic bacteria. evaluation of erythrophore cell response, using bacillus spp., has revealed that this response can distinguish pathogenic bacillus cereus from a non-pathogenic b. cereus deltaplcr deletion mutant and a non-pathogenic bacillus  subtilis. erythrophore cells were exposed to salmonella enteritidis, clostridium  perfringens and clostridium botulinum. each bacterial pathogen elicited a response from erythrophore cells that was distinguished from the corresponding bacterial growth medium, and this observed response was unique for each bacterial pathogen. these findings suggest that erythrophore cell response has potential for use as a biosensor in the detection and toxicity assessment for food-associated pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == levels and toxigenicity of bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens from retail seafood.
AB  == for the period 1990 through 2003, seafood was the most commonly identified food linked to foodborne outbreaks in the united states. fish as a commodity has rarely been examined for the presence of bacillus cereus in particular. for the present study, 347 fresh and processed retail seafood samples were examined for the presence of clostridium botulinum, clostridium perfringens, and b. cereus. the presence of c. botulinum was not confirmed in any of the isolates, but c. perfringens was confirmed in 17 samples. one of the c. perfringens isolates possessed the enterotoxin gene, as determined by pcr. in contrast, 62 confirmed b. cereus isolates were obtained from separate samples at levels ranging from 3.6 to > 1,100 cfu/g. thirty (48%) of 62 isolates produced both the hemolysin bl (hbl) and nonhemolytic (nhe) enterotoxins, and 58 (94%) and 31 (50%) produced nhe or hbl toxins, respectively. the presence of at least one of the three genes of the nhe complex was detected in 99% of the isolates; 69% of the isolates possessed all three genes. in contrast, 71% of the isolates possessed at least one of the three genes of the hbl complex, and 37% possessed all three hbl gene components. fifty of the 62 b. cereus isolates were from imported seafood, and 19 (38%) of these samples were at levels > 100 cfu/g. twelve of the 14 highest enterotoxin assay results were from isolates from imported food. only one b. cereus isolate possessed the cereulide synthetase gene, ces; this isolate also possessed the genes for the three-component hbl and nhe complexes. a majority of  enterotoxin-producing isolates were resistant to 2 of 10 antibiotics tested, ceftriaxone and clindamycin. our results demonstrate the potential of seafood as  a vehicle for foodborne illness caused by b. cereus, in particular the enterotoxin-producing genotype.

TI  == structural basis of actin recognition and arginine adp-ribosylation by clostridium perfringens iota-toxin.
AB  == the adp-ribosylating toxins (adprts) produced by pathogenic bacteria modify intracellular protein and affect eukaryotic cell function. actin-specific adprts  (including clostridium perfringens iota-toxin and clostridium botulinum c2 toxin) adp-ribosylate g-actin at arg-177, leading to disorganization of the cytoskeleton and cell death. although the structures of many actin-specific adprts are available, the mechanisms underlying actin recognition and selective adp-ribosylation of arg-177 remain unknown. here we report the crystal structure  of actin-ia in complex with the nonhydrolyzable nad analog betatad at 2.8 a resolution. the structure indicates that ia recognizes actin via five loops around nad: loop i (tyr-60-tyr-62 in the n domain), loop ii (active-site loop), loop iii, loop iv (pn loop), and loop v (adp-ribosylating turn-turn loop). we used site-directed mutagenesis to confirm that loop i on the n domain and loop ii are essential for the adp-ribosyltransferase activity. furthermore, we revealed that glu-378 on the exe loop is in close proximity to arg-177 in actin, and we proposed that the adp-ribosylation of arg-177 proceeds by an sn1 reaction via first an oxocarbenium ion intermediate and second a cationic intermediate by alleviating the strained conformation of the first oxocarbenium ion. our results  suggest a common reaction mechanism for adprts. moreover, the structure might be  of use in rational drug design to block toxin-substrate recognition.

TI  == binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins and their use as molecular trojan horses for drug delivery into eukaryotic cells.
AB  == binary bacterial toxins are unique ab-type toxins, composed of two non-linked proteins that act as a binding/translocation component and an enzyme component. all known actin-adp-ribosylating toxins from clostridia possess this binary structure. this toxin family is comprised of the prototypical clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridium perfringens iota toxin, clostridium difficile cdt, and clostridium spiroforme toxin. once in the cytosol of host cells, these toxins transfer an adp-ribose moiety from nicotinamide-adenosine-dinucleotide onto g-actin that then leads to depolymerization of actin filaments. in recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the cellular uptake mechanism of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, and in particular that of c2 toxin. both components act in a precisely concerted manner to intoxicate eukaryotic cells. the binding/translocation (b-) component forms a complex with the enzyme (a-) component and mediates toxin binding to a cell-surface receptor.  following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the enzyme component escapes from acidic endosomes into the cytosol. acidification of endosomes triggers pore formation by the binding/translocation component in endosomal membranes and the enzyme component subsequently translocates through the pore. this step requires a host cell chaperone, hsp90. due to their unique structure, binary toxins are naturally "tailor made" for transporting foreign proteins into the cytosol of host cells. several highly specific and cell-permeable recombinant fusion proteins have been  designed and successfully used in experimental cell research. this review will focus on the recent progress in studying binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins as  highly effective virulence factors and innovative tools for cell physiology as well as pharmacology.

TI  == differential requirement for the translocation of clostridial binary toxins: iota toxin requires a membrane potential gradient.
AB  == clostridial binary toxins, such as clostridium perfringens iota and clostridium botulinum c2, are composed of a binding protein (ib and c2-ii, respectively) that recognizes distinct membrane receptors and mediates internalization of a catalytic protein (ia and c2-i, respectively) with adp-ribosyltransferase activity that depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton. after internalization, it was found that c2 and iota toxins were not routed to the golgi apparatus and exhibited differential sensitivity to inhibitors of endosome acidification. while the c2-i component of c2 toxin was translocated into the cytosol from early endosomes, translocation of the ia component of iota toxin occurred between early and late endosomes, was dependent on more acidic conditions, and uniquely required a membrane potential gradient.

TI  == automated ribotyping for the identification and characterization of foodborne clostridia.
AB  == the dupont qualicon riboprinter was employed to determine if automated ribotyping could be used to differentiate between and characterize various species of foodborne clostridia. ecori digests were used to ribotype 49 isolates that represented seven clostridium species: c. aerotolerans, c. beirjerinckii, c. botulinum, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, c. putrificum, and c. sporogenes. ecorv  digests were also used to ribotype 17 c. botulinum isolates to determine if an alternate restriction enzyme was more suitable than was ecori for toxin typing. it was concluded that the riboprinter could be potentially used to identify most  of the clostridia represented in the study, but that the system has difficulty distinguishing between c. botulinum and c. sporogenes. the system may also be potentially used to characterize clostridia based on phenotypic characteristics.  toxin typing of clostridia remains problematic, but may be improved by the use of restriction enzyme combinations.

TI  == organization and regulation of the neurotoxin genes in clostridium botulinum and  clostridium tetani.
AB  == botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins are structurally and functionally related 150 kda proteins that are potent inhibitors of neuroexocytosis. botulinum neurotoxin  associates with non-toxic proteins to form complexes of various sizes. the botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are clustered in a dna segment called the botulinum locus. this locus is probably located on a mobile or degenerate mobile element, which accounts for the various genomic localizations (chromosome, plasmid, phage) in different clostridium botulinum types. the botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are organized in two polycistronic operons (ntnh-bont and ha operons) transcribed in opposite orientations. the gene that separates the two operons of the botulinum locus in c. botulinum a encodes a 21 kda protein botr/a, which is a positive regulator of  the expression of the botulinum locus genes. similarly, in clostridium tetani, the gene located immediately upstream of the tetanus toxin gene, encodes a positive regulatory protein, tetr. botr and tetr are possibly alternative sigma factors related to txer and uvia, which regulate c. difficile toxin and c. perfringens bacteriocin production, respectively. txer and uvia define a new sub-group of the sigma(70) family of rna polymerase initiation factors. in addition, the c. botulinum genome contains predicted two-component system genes,  some of which are possibly involved in regulation of toxinogenesis.

TI  == insights in metabolism and toxin production from the complete genome sequence of  clostridium tetani.
AB  == the decryption of prokaryotic genome sequences progresses rapidly and provides the scientific community with an enormous amount of information. clostridial genome sequencing projects have been finished only recently, starting with the genome of the solvent-producing clostridium acetobutylicum in 2001. a lot of attention has been devoted to the genomes of pathogenic clostridia. in 2002, the  genome sequence of c. perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene, has been  released. currently in the finishing stage and prior to publication are the genomes of the foodborne botulism-causing c. botulinum and of c. difficile, the causative agent of a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. our team sequenced the genome of neuropathogenic  c. tetani, a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium predominantly found in the soil. in deep wound infections it occasionally causes spastic paralysis in humans and vertebrate animals, known as tetanus disease, by the secretion of potent neurotoxin, designated tetanus toxin. the toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic membranes of interneurons of the spinal cord and the brainstem, thus preventing muscle relaxation. fortunately, this disease is successfully controlled through immunization with tetanus toxoid, a formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin, but nevertheless, an estimated 400,000 cases  still occur each year, mainly of neonatal tetanus. the world health organization  has stated that neonatal tetanus is the second leading cause of death from vaccine preventable diseases among children worldwide. this minireview focuses on an analysis of the genome sequence of c. tetani e88, a vaccine production strain, which is a toxigenic non-sporulating variant of strain massachusetts. the genome  consists of a 2,799,250 bp chromosome encoding 2618 open reading frames. the tetanus toxin is encoded on a 74,082 kb plasmid, containing 61 genes. additional  virulence-related factors as well as an insight into the metabolic strategy of c. tetani with regard to its pathogenic phenotype will be presented. the information from other clostridial genomes by means of comparative analysis will also be explored.

TI  == regulation of toxin and bacteriocin gene expression in clostridium by interchangeable rna polymerase sigma factors.
AB  == the production of major extracellular toxins by pathogenic strains of clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani and clostridium difficile, and a bacteriocin by clostridium perfringens is dependent on a related group of rna polymerase sigma-factors. these sigma-factors (botr, tetr, tcdr and uvia) were shown to be sufficiently similar that they could substitute for one another in in vitro dna binding and run-off transcription experiments. in cells, however, the sigma-factors fell into two subclasses. botr and tetr were able to direct transcription of their target genes in a fully reciprocal manner. similarly, uvia and tcdr were fully interchangeable. neither botr nor tetr could substitute for uvia or tcdr, however, and neither uvia nor tcdr could direct transcription of the natural targets of botr or tetr. the extent of functional interchangeability  of the sigma-factors was attributed to the strong conservation of their subregion 4.2 sequences and the conserved -35 sequences of their target promoters, while restrictions on interchangeability were attributed to variations in their subregion 2.4 sequences and the target site -10 sequences. the four sigma-factors have been assigned to group 5 of the sigma(70) family and seem to have arisen from a common ancestral protein that may have co-evolved with the genes whose transcription they direct. a fifth clostridiumsigma-factor, sigma(y) of clostridium acetobutylicum, resembles the tcdr family, but was not functionally interchangeable with members of this family.

AB  == many clostridium species are pathogenic for humans and animals, and most of the resulting diseases, such as tetanus, botulism, gas gangrene and pseudomembranous  colitis, are due to the production of potent extracellular toxins. the biochemical mechanisms of action of clostridium toxins have been extensively studied in the past ten years. however, detailed information about the regulation of toxin gene expression has only recently emerged. tcdr, botr, tetr and uvia are now known to be related alternative rna polymerase sigma factors that drive transcription of toxin a and toxin b genes in c. difficile, the neurotoxin genes  in c. botulinum and c. tetani, and a bacteriocin gene in c. perfringens. although the clostridium sigma factors have some similarity to members of the ecf sigma factor group, they differ sufficiently in structure and function so that they have been assigned to a new group within the sigma(70)-family.

TI  == salmonella enterica spvb adp-ribosylates actin at position arginine-177-characterization of the catalytic domain within the spvb protein and a comparison to binary clostridial actin-adp-ribosylating toxins.
AB  == the spvb protein from salmonella enterica was recently discovered as an actin-adp-ribosylating toxin. spvb is most likely delivered via a type-iii secretion system into eukaryotic cells and does not have a binding/translocation  component. this is in contrast to the family of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins from various bacillus and clostridium species. however, there are homologies in amino acid sequences between the c-terminal domain of spvb and the  catalytic domains of the actin-adp-ribosylating toxins such as c2 toxin from clostridium botulinum and iota toxin from clostridium perfringens. we compared the biochemical properties of the catalytic c-terminal domain of spvb (c/spvb) with the enzyme components of c2 toxin and iota toxin. the specificity of c/spvb  concerning the modification of g- or f-actin was comparable to the c2 and iota toxins, although there were distinct differences regarding the recognition of actin isoforms. c/spvb and iota toxin modify both muscle alpha-actin and nonmuscle beta/gamma-actin, whereas c2 toxin only modifies beta/gamma-actin. in contrast to the iota and c2 toxins, c/spvb possessed no detectable glycohydrolase activity in the absence of a protein substrate. the maximal reaction rates were comparable for all toxins, whereas variable k(m) values for nad were evident. we  identified arginine-177 as the modification site for c/spvb with the actin homologue protein act88f from drosophila.

TI  == clostridium botulinum: a bug with beauty and weapon.
AB  == clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, anaerobic spore-forming bacteria, is distinguished by its significant clinical applications as well as its potential to be used as bioterror agent. growing cells secrete botulinum neurotoxin (bont), the most poisonous of all known poisons. while bont is the causative agent of deadly neuroparalytic botulism, it also serves as a remarkably effective treatment for involuntary muscle disorders such as blepharospasm, strabismus, hemifacial spasm, certain types of spasticity in children, and other ailments. bont is also used in cosmetology for the treatment of glabellar lines, and is well-known as the active component of the anti-aging medications botox and dysport. in addition, recent reports show that botulinum neurotoxin can be used as a tool for pharmaceutical drug delivery. however, bont remains the deadliest of all toxins, and is viewed by biodefense researchers as a possible agent of bioterrorism (bt). among seven serotypes, c. botulinum type a is responsible for  the highest mortality rate in botulism, and thus has the greatest potential to act as biological weapon. genome sequencing of c. botulinum type a hall strain (atcc 3502) is now complete, and has shown the genome size to be 3.89 mb with a g+c content of approximately 28.2%. the bacterium harbors a 16.3 kb plasmid with  a 26.8% g+c content--slightly lower than that of the chromosome. most of the virulence factors in c. botulinum are chromosomally encoded; bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence has shown that the plasmid does not harbor toxin  genes or genes for related virulence factors. interestingly, the plasmid does harbor genes essential to replication, including dnae, which encodes the alpha subunit of dna polymerase iii which has close similarity with its counterpart in  c. perfringens strain 13. the plasmid also contains similar genes to those that encode the abc-type multidrug transport atpase, and permease. the presence of abc-type multidrug transport atpase, and permease suggests putative involvement of efflux pumps in bacteriocin production, modification, and export in c. botulinum. the c. botulinum plasmid additionally harbors genes for lambdaba04 prophage and site-specific recombinase that are similar to those found in the ames strain of bacillus anthracis; these genes and their products may play a role in genomic rearrangement. completion of genome sequencing for c. botulinum will provide an opportunity to design genomic and proteomic-based systems for detecting different serotypes of c. botulinum strains in the environment. the completed sequence may also facilitate identification of potential virulence factors and drug targets, as well as help characterize neurotoxin-complexing proteins, their polycistronic expression, and phylogenetic relationships between  different serotypes.

AB  == the threat of bioterrorism remains a reality worldwide and, although of low probability, an attack would be a high-consequence event. microbes are available  to individuals with appropriate contacts and even many low-grade bacterial pathogens can severely affect health. toxins provide bacteria with a system of defence that is often detrimental to humans and their versatility makes them potential tools of bioterrorism. it should be remembered that the aim of terrorism is not always to kill but rather to strike fear into peoples lives. therefore, agents such as botulinum and cholera toxin could be used, which may not cause significant mortality but would cause widespread panic and potentially  high morbidity. importantly, no state can ever be fully prepared for a response and it is probable that no state ever could be. it is for this reason that biological agents are so attractive as weapons.

AB  == clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, respectively, produce potent toxins, botulinum neurotoxin (bont) and tetanus neurotoxin (tetx), which are responsible for severe diseases, botulism and tetanus. neurotoxin synthesis is a  regulated process in clostridium. the genes botr/a in c. botulinum a and tetr in  c. tetani positively regulate expression of bont/a and associated non-toxic proteins (antps), as well as tetx respectively. the botr/a gene lies in close vicinity of the two operons which contain bont/a and antps genes in c. botulinum  a, and tetr immediately precedes the tetx gene in c. tetani. we show that botr/a  and tetr function as specific alternative sigma factors rather than positive regulators based on the following results: (i) botr/a and tetr associated with target dnas only in the presence of the rna polymerase core enzyme (core), (ii) botr/a and tetr directly bound with the core enzyme, (iii) botr/a-core recognized -35 and -10 regions of ntnh-bont/a promoter and (iv) botr/a and tetr triggered in vitro transcription from the target promoters. in c. botulinum a, bont/a and antps genes are transcribed as bi- and tricistronic operons controlled by botr/a. botr/a and tetr are seemingly related to a new subgroup of the sigma70 family that includes tcdr and uvia, which, respectively, regulate production of toxins a and b in c. difficile and bacteriocin in c. perfringens. sequences of -35 region  are highly conserved in the promoter of target toxin genes in c. botulinum, c. tetani, c. difficile and c. perfringens. overall, a common regulation mechanism probably controls toxin gene expression in these four toxigenic clostridial species.

TI  == binary bacterial toxins: biochemistry, biology, and applications of common clostridium and bacillus proteins.
AB  == certain pathogenic species of bacillus and clostridium have developed unique methods for intoxicating cells that employ the classic enzymatic "a-b" paradigm for protein toxins. the binary toxins produced by b. anthracis, b. cereus, c. botulinum, c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. spiroforme consist of components  not physically associated in solution that are linked to various diseases in humans, animals, or insects. the "b" components are synthesized as precursors that are subsequently activated by serine-type proteases on the targeted cell surface and/or in solution. following release of a 20-kda n-terminal peptide, the activated "b" components form homoheptameric rings that subsequently dock with an "a" component(s) on the cell surface. by following an acidified endosomal route and translocation into the cytosol, "a" molecules disable a cell (and host organism) via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic amp, or inactivation of signaling pathways linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. recently, b. anthracis has gleaned much notoriety as a biowarfare/bioterrorism agent, and of primary interest has been the edema and lethal toxins, their role in anthrax, as well as the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeting these virulence factors and ultimately b. anthracis. this review comprehensively surveys the literature and discusses the similarities, as well as distinct differences, between each clostridium and bacillus binary toxin in terms of their biochemistry, biology, genetics, structure, and applications in science and medicine. the information may foster future studies that aid novel vaccine and drug development, as well as a better understanding of a conserved intoxication process utilized by various gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria.

TI  == medical aspects of biologic toxins.
AB  == biologic toxins are molecules produced by living organisms that are poisonous to  other species, such as humans. some biologic toxins are so potent and relatively  easy to produce that they have been classified as biothreat agents. these include the botulinum neurotoxins, ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxin b, and clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin. this article focuses on these four biothreat toxins and their medical aspects. the majority of the article is spent on the botulinum  neurotoxins, because these are the most poisonous substances known and are the only toxins classified as category a threat agents-the highest level of threat agent. the remainder of the article is devoted to sections on the other three biothreat toxins: ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxin b, and c perfringens epsilon  toxin.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == influence of several methodological factors on the growth of clostridium perfringens in cooling rate challenge studies.
AB  == proper temperature control is essential in preventing clostridium perfringens food poisoning. the u.s. department of agriculture food safety and inspection service cooling guidelines offer two options for the cooling of meat products: follow a standard time-temperature schedule or validate that alternative cooling  regimens result in no more than a 1-log cfu/g increase of c. perfringens and no growth of clostridium botulinum. the latter option requires laboratory challenge  studies to validate the efficacy of a given cooling process. accordingly, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of several methodological variables that might be encountered during typical c. perfringens challenge studies. variables studied included plastic bag type (whirlpak or spiral biotech), sealing method (multivac or foodsaver), initial spore inoculum size (1  to approximately 3 log cfu/g), and growth environment (ground beef or trypticase-peptone-glucose-yeast extract [tpgy] broth). the major factors that affected growth were sample bag type and growth environment. samples incubated in whirlpak bags showed significantly less growth than those incubated in spiral biotech bags, which was likely due to the former bag's greater oxygen permeability. c. perfringens spores showed shorter germination, outgrowth, and lag times and c. perfringens cells showed faster growth rates in ground beef compared with tpgy broth. no significant difference was observed between two different sealing methods. initial spore inoculum levels in the range studied had no significant effect on final c. perfringens cell concentration.

TI  == clostridial disease associated with neurologic signs: tetanus, botulism, and enterotoxemia.
AB  == clostridial infections are found worldwide in almost all species of animals and may involve a variety of body systems and present with a diversity of clinical signs. most damage done through clostridial infections is due to the action of toxins released from the bacteria.thus, disease caused by clostridium spp should  more correctly be called intoxication. two prominent clostridial infections are associated with neurologic signs: clostridium botulinum and c tetani. in both infections, the mechanism that is responsible for causing the problem is similar, despite the remarkable difference in clinical presentation. in addition, neurologic signs are described with c perfringens types c and d but are not the dominant feature of these diseases.

(food microbiol. 16:335-349, 1999) may be helpful in determining if the c. perfringens performance standard has been achieved, but this model has not been extensively validated. the objective of this study was to validate the juneja 1999 model in ground beef under a variety of changing temperature and temperature abuse situations. the juneja 1999 model consistently underpredicted growth of c. perfringens during exponential cooling of ground beef. the model also underpredicted growth of c. perfringens in ground  beef cooled at two different rates. the results presented here show generally good agreement with published data on the growth of c. perfringens in similar products. the model error may be due to faster-than-expected exponential growth rates in ground beef during cooling or an error in the mathematical formulation of the model.

TI  == clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin activates the sphingomyelin metabolism system in sheep erythrocytes.
AB  == clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin induces hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes through the activation of glycerophospholipid metabolism. sheep erythrocytes contain large amounts of sphingomyelin (sm) but not phosphatidylcholine. we investigated the relationship between the toxin-induced hemolysis and sm metabolic system in sheep erythrocytes. alpha-toxin simultaneously induced hemolysis and a reduction in the levels of sm and formation of ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (s1p). n-oleoylethanolamine, a ceramidase inhibitor, inhibited the toxin-induced hemolysis and caused ceramide to accumulate in the toxin-treated cells. furthermore, dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine and b-5354c, isolated from a novel marine bacterium, both sphingosine kinase inhibitors, blocked the toxin-induced hemolysis and production of s1p and caused sphingosine  to accumulate. these observations suggest that the toxin-induced activation of the sm metabolic system is closely related to hemolysis. s1p potentiated the toxin-induced hemolysis of saponin-permeabilized erythrocytes but had no effect on that of intact cells. preincubation of lysated sheep erythrocytes with pertussis toxin blocked the alpha-toxin-induced formation of ceramide from sm. in addition, incubation of c. botulinum c3 exoenzyme-treated lysates of sheep erythrocytes with alpha-toxin caused an accumulation of sphingosine and inhibition of the formation of s1p. these observations suggest that the alpha-toxin-induced hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes is dependent on the activation of the sm metabolic system through gtp-binding proteins, especially the formation of s1p.

TI  == bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bactericidal effects of japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the ph of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). konjac fluids completely inactivated escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7 and e. coil o26:h9, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahemolyticus. and staphylococcus aureus. the initial level of 6 log cfu/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable s. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. on the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum type e and type a). at least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. when the initial cell count was 6 log cfu/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected  after 120 days. when the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log cfu/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within i to 3 days. repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination  during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.

TI  == the host cell chaperone hsp90 is essential for translocation of the binary clostridium botulinum c2 toxin into the cytosol.
AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin is the prototype of the binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins and consists of the binding component c2ii and the  enzyme component c2i. the activated binding component c2iia forms heptamers, which bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface and interact with the enzyme component c2i. this toxin complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. in acidic endosomes, heptameric c2iia forms pores and mediates the translocation  of c2i into the cytosol. we report that the heat shock protein (hsp) 90-specific  inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol, block intoxication of vero cells, rat astrocytes, and hela cells by c2 toxin. adp-ribosylation of actin in the cytosol  of toxin-treated cells revealed that less active c2i was translocated into the cytosol after treatment with hsp90 inhibitors. under control conditions, c2i was  localized in the cytosol of toxin-treated rat astrocytes, whereas geldanamycin blocked the cytosolic distribution of c2i. at low extracellular ph (ph 4.5), which allows the direct translocation of c2i via c2iia heptamers across the cell  membrane into the cytosol, hsp90 inhibitors retarded intoxication by c2i. geldanamycin did not affect toxin binding, endocytosis, and pore formation by c2iia. the adp-ribosyltransferase activity of c2i was not affected by hsp90 inhibitors in vitro. the cytotoxic actions of the actin-adp-ribosylating clostridium perfringens iota toxin and the rho-adp-ribosylating c2-c3 fusion toxin was similarly blocked by hsp90 inhibitors. in contrast, radicicol and geldanamycin had no effect on anthrax lethal toxin-induced cytotoxicity of j774-a1 macrophage-like cells or on cytotoxic effects of the glucosylating clostridium difficile toxin b in vero cells. the data indicate that hsp90 is essential for the membrane translocation of adp-ribosylating toxins delivered by  c2ii.

TI  == an investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  == in 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the uk and ireland was reported and clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to c. botulinum and bacillus cereus were also reported. because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in england during 2000 and 2002. two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. the first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (mrd) which was inoculated directly into clostridium botulinum isolation cooked meat broth (cbi). the second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in cbi broth. duplicate cbi broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min. subcultures were made after incubation for 7  and 14 days on to eight different solid media. the methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either c. botulinum or c. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the mrd suspension technique. fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. no fungi were isolated. aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus  spp. and paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at  least one species was isolated from each sample. b. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with b. licheniformis isolated  from 40%. between one and five samples yielded cultures of b. coagulans, b. laterosporus, b. pumilus, b. subtilis and p. macerans. staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; s. warneri and s. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. one or two samples yielded cultures of s. aureus, s. capitis and s. haemolyticus. the remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with c. perfringens and two samples with either c. sordellii or c. tertium. multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the  remaining 15. in 13 samples b. cereus alone was isolated, in one b. subtilis alone and in one sample b. pumilus alone. c. botulinum and c. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.

AB  == several bacterial protein toxins, including clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridum perfringens iota toxin, clostridium difficile adp-ribosyltransferase,  and the bacillus-produced vegetative insecticidal proteins, target the cytoskeleton by adp-ribosylation of actin. all these toxins are binary in structure and consist of an enzyme component, possessing adp-ribosyltransferase activity and a separated binding and translocation component, which is involved in the delivery of the enzyme component into the cell. the toxins are not only important virulence factors but also cell biological tools to study the function  of the actin cytoskeleton. moreover, the binary toxins turned out to be effective transporter systems for the delivery of specific fusion toxins (e.g., rho-adp-ribosylating c3 exoenzyme) into cells. the present review describes the biological functions of the toxins, focuses on recent studies on the uptake and delivery mechanism and discusses the usage as a drug delivery system.

TI  == clostridium perfringens iota toxin. mapping of the ia domain involved in docking  with ib and cellular internalization.
AB  == clostridium perfringens iota toxin consists of two unlinked proteins. the binding component (ib) is required to internalize into cells an enzymatic component (ia)  that adp-ribosylates g-actin. to characterize the ia domain that interacts with ib, fusion proteins were constructed between the c. botulinum c3 enzyme, which adp-ribosylates rho, and various truncated versions of ia. these chimeric molecules retained the wild type adp-ribosyltransferase activity specific for rho and were recognized by antibodies against c3 enzyme and ia. internalization of each chimera into vero cells was assessed by measuring the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular adp-ribosylation of rho. fusion proteins containing c3 linked to the c terminus of ia were transported most efficiently into cells like wild type ia in an ib-dependent manner that was blocked by bafilomycin a1. the minimal ia fragment that promoted translocation of ia-c3 chimeras into cells consisted of 128 central residues (129-257). these findings revealed that iota toxin is a suitable system for mediating the entry of heterologous proteins such as c3 into cells.

TI  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin: binding studies with fluorescence-activated cytometry.
AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 enterotoxin consists of two unlinked proteins designated as c2ii, which recognizes a cell-surface glycoprotein and translocates an adp-ribosyltransferase, c2i, into the cytosol of a targeted cell. fluorescence-activated cytometry was used to study the cellular interactions of alexa488-labeled c2i (c2i-a488) and proteolytically activated c2ii (c2iia-a488).  the binding of c2iia-a488 (4 degrees c/10 min) to chinese hamster ovary (cho) and african green monkey kidney (vero) cells yielded a signal/noise ratio of 7:1 and  4:1, respectively. c2i-a488 binding required c2iia and resulted in a 4:1 (cho) and 10:1 (vero) signal/noise ratio that was readily competed by unlabeled c2i. neither c2i nor c2iia bound to a cho line (rk14), lacking the receptor for c2iia. c2i-a488 did not dock with the heterologous cell-binding component (iota b) of clostridium perfringens iota toxin, a binary toxin closely related to c2. pretreatment of wild-type cho or vero cells with pronase or papain (37 degrees c/30 min) prevented a cell-associated c2iia-specific signal. however, cho and vero cells pretreated with papain at 25 degrees c had a 1.5- to 2.3-fold increase in c2iia-specific fluorescence versus untreated cells incubated with c2iia-a488.  overall, these studies further demonstrated the utility of fluorescence-activated cytometry for studying the binding characteristics of bacterial binary toxins like c2.

TI  == microbiological, biological, and chemical weapons of warfare and terrorism.
AB  == microbiological, biological, and chemical toxins have been employed in warfare and in terrorist attacks. in this era, it is imperative that health care providers are familiar with illnesses caused by these agents. botulinum toxin produces a descending flaccid paralysis. staphylococcal enterotoxin b produces a  syndrome of fever, nausea, and diarrhea and may produce a pulmonary syndrome if aerosolized. clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin could possibly be aerosolized  to produce acute pulmonary edema. ricin intoxication can manifest as gastrointestinal hemorrhage after ingestion, severe muscle necrosis after intramuscular injection, and acute pulmonary disease after inhalation. nerve agents inhibit acetylcholinesterase and thus produce symptoms of increased cholinergic activity. ammonia, chlorine, vinyl chloride, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, tear gas, and zinc chloride primarily injure the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. sulfur mustard (and nitrogen mustard) are  vesicant and alkylating agents. cyanide poisoning ranges from sudden-onset headache and drowsiness to severe hypoxemia, cardiovascular collapse, and death.  health care providers should be familiar with the medical consequences of toxin exposure, and understand the pathophysiology and management of resulting illness.

AB  == aims: little information exists regarding the microbiology of two traditional maori food preparation processes which may involve fermentations. preliminary microbiological and chemical analyses were carried out on these two foods in order to identify the fermentations involved (if any). methods and results: testing was carried out on freshly-prepared foods and on those that had been processed and stored. kina (sea urchins, evechinus chloroticus) are harvested and then stored either under fresh water or buried underground. the most frequently-occurring process appeared to be an alkaline fermentation. large numbers of clostridium perfringens were detected in one set of samples prepared outside of the traditional season, but this was the only pathogen detected. in kina stored in buried plastic bottles during the traditionally-accepted time of the year, bacterial numbers decreased. tiroi is prepared from mussels and puha (sow thistle, sonchos asper) that have been cooked to some degree, combined and stored. of three methods used to prepare and store tiroi, the results for one indicated the possible involvement of a lactic acid fermentation, but the other two methods were effectively only cooking and bottling processes. conclusions: in the case of kina, the use of an alkaline fermentation to prepare a seafood for consumption is unusual. one method of tiroi production is a lactic acid fermentation. significance and impact of the study: if these foods are produced as described and are not either eaten immediately or cooked before consumption, then growth, and intoxication by, clostridium botulinum might occur.

TI  == characterization of the enzymatic component of the adp-ribosyltransferase toxin cdta from clostridium difficile.
AB  == certain strains of clostridium difficile produce the adp-ribosyltransferase cdt,  which is a binary actin adp-ribosylating toxin. the toxin consists of the binding component cdtb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component cdta. here we studied the enzyme component (cdta) of the toxin using the binding component of clostridium perfringens iota toxin (ib), which is  interchangeable with cdtb as a transport component. ib was used because cdtb was  not expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli. similar to iota toxin, cdta adp-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. the n-terminal part of cdta (cdta1-240) competes with full-length cdta for binding to the iota toxin binding component. the c-terminal part (cdta244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length cdta. changes of glu428 and glu430 to glutamine, ser388 to alanine, and arg345 to lysine blocked adp-ribosyltransferase activity. comparison of cdta with c. perfringens iota toxin and clostridium botulinum c2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment ia208-413 but loss of activity of several n-terminally deleted c2i proteins including c2i103-431, c2i190-431, and c2i30-431. the data indicate that  cdta belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins  with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. it shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and c2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in nad-binding and/or catalytic activity. the enzyme components of cdt, iota toxin, and c2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.

TI  == differentiation of clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum from non-toxigenic clostridia, isolated from prepared and frozen foods by pcr-dan based methods.
AB  == during the elaboration process of prepared and frozen foods, clostridium sp. have been reported. from those microorganisms, c. perfringens and c. botulinum may pose a high risk for the consumers. to avoid these pathogenic organisms an haccp  program should be implemented, but in addition sensitive and moderately time consuming microbiological methods for monitoring c. perfringens and c. boulinum should be established. in this work, an rflp analysis of the 16s rdna will be developed to differentiate c. perfringens from other clostridium sp. in addition, a pcr protocol, will be assayed to detect c. botulinum. both two methods will be  compared with biochemical characterization by api system. the restriction analysis of the 16s rdna with taq i and rsa i showed at least the same sensitivity to differentiate c. perfringens from clostridial isolates as biochemical identification. however, the former method takes only 8-10 h of analysis as compared with 24-48 h required for biochemical characterization. with the specific pcr protocol to detect c. botulinum a band of 1.1 kbp was obtained derived from the specific amplification of bont genes, taking 6-8 h for analysis. both two molecular dna based methods should be considered as verification techniques of pathogenic clostridia in the haccp program.

TI  == bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  == numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. the clostridial binary toxins (iota and c2 families) adp-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. the large clostridial toxins from clostridium difficile, clostridium sordellii and clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the rho family that regulate actin polymerization. in contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from escherichia coli  activates rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. the  enterotoxin of bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for e-cadherin and it  promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. the bacterial toxins that  modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes  in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.

TI  == [detection of toxin-producing pathogenic bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for detection of pathogenic clostridium  botulinum, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli.  with this aim in view, primers to botulinic toxins types a, b, c1, d, e, f, and g, perfringens enterotoxin, difficile toxin, and types 1 and 2 shigella-like toxins were chosen and synthesized. optimal amplification conditions were selected for each pair of primers, with dna and the respective agent as the reaction mixture matrices. pcr was highly specific and sensitive in all cases. its sensitivity was 10-100 cells/sample. among the tested c. botulinum, c. perfringens, c. difficile, and e. coli strains, specific amplification products of expected size were observed only in the strains containing the respective toxin genes. these findings recommend the use of these methods in clinical microbiology. strains containing type 2 shigella-like toxin gene were detected among e. coli strains isolated from patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome,  which for the first time indicates that the problem with e. coli epidemic strain  o157 is valid for russia. as a result of our studies, test systems for detection  of types a, b, c, d, e, f, and g c. botulinum strains, c. perfringens and c. difficile, and e. coli o157 strains are now available.

TI  == control of bacterial spores.
AB  == bacterial spores are much more resistant than their vegetative counterparts. the  most dangerous spore-former is clostridium botulinum which produces a potent neurotoxin that can prove fatal. the most common food poisoning from a spore-former is caused by c. perfringens. other food poisoning spore-formers include bacillus cereus, b. subtilis and b. licheniformis. there are a number of  non-pathogenic spore-formers including butyric and thermophilic anaerobes that cause significant economic losses to food producers. some unusual spoilage complaints have been reported, for example, b. sporothermodurans in uht milk, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris in apple and orange juice and desulfotomaculum nigrificans in hot vending machines. control of spore-formers requires an understanding of both the resistance and outgrowth characteristics of the spores.

TI  == bacteria associated with processed crawfish and potential toxin production by clostridium botulinum type e in vacuum-packaged and aerobically packaged crawfish tails.
AB  == refrigerated vacuum-packaged storage has been shown to increase significantly the shelf life of fresh fish and seafood products, but the effect, if any, on the outgrowth and toxin production of clostridium botulinum type e on cooked crawfish is unknown. microflora associated with live crawfish reflect the microbial populations of the harvest water and sediments in which they are living. the presence or absence of specific pathogens in either vacuum-packaged or air-permeable bags of cooked crawfish have not been thoroughly evaluated. this study evaluates the potential survival and outgrowth of biological hazards in both vacuum-packaged and air-permeable-packaged cooked crawfish held at 4 and 10  degrees c for 30 days. during shelf-life studies of vacuum-packaged and air-permeable-bagged cooked crawfish, a total of 31 bacterial species were isolated and identified from crawfish samples using both selective and nonselective media. the only pathogens isolated from both vacuum-packed and air-permeable bags of processed crawfish samples during shelf-life studies were strains of aeromonas hydrophila and staphylococcus aureus. c. botulinum type e and clostridium perfringens species were not isolated from any of the uninoculated crawfish samples. cooked crawfish were inoculated with 10(3) c. botulinum type e spores per g of crawfish tail meat to determine whether cooked crawfish tails would support the growth of c. botulinum type e strains and produce toxin at refrigerated temperatures. spore-inoculated crawfish tails were  vacuum packaged in both a high barrier film and an air-permeable bag and stored at 4 degrees c and 10 degrees c for 30 days. c. botulinum toxin e was not detected in any of the spore-inoculated packages throughout the shelf-life study  until day 30. microbiological data from this study should be useful in the development and implementation of the hazard analysis and critical control point  plans for processed crawfish tails.

TI  == ribotyping as an identification tool for clostridium botulinum strains causing human botulism.
AB  == ribotyping was used for characterisation of 68 clostridium botulinum strains and  five related clostridium species to determine the applicability of this method for identification of species causing human botulism. thirteen restriction enzymes were initially tested for suitability for ribotyping of c. botulinum, of  which ecori and hindiii were selected. both enzymes clearly differentiated between proteolytic (group i) and a nonproteolytic (group ii) strains of c. botulinum, and can be recommended for group/species identification. using a commercial software package (gelcompar), a numerical analysis of the discriminatory abilities of ecori and hindiii ribotyping within and between the two c. botulinum groups was performed. ecori had the higher discriminatory index  (0.982), but the ribopatterns generated with group ii strains were partly muddled and difficult to interpret. all hindiii ribopatterns were easy to analyse and the discriminatory index for all strains was almost equally high (0.954), whereas this enzyme did not discriminate well between group i isolates. the clostridium strains diverged at 35+/-13% (mean+/-standard deviation) dice similarity in dendrograms based on cluster analysis of the ribotyping results. these findings are in good agreement with taxonomical ribotyping studies with other bacterial genera, indicating that ribotyping is a highly suitable method for c. botulinum species identification.

TI  == tetr is a positive regulator of the tetanus toxin gene in clostridium tetani and  is homologous to botr.
AB  == the tetr gene immediately upstream from the tetanus toxin (tetx) gene was characterized. it encodes a 21,562-da protein which is related (50 to 65% identity) to the equivalent genes (botr) in clostridium botulinum. tetr has the feature of a dna binding protein with a basic pi (9.53). it contains a helix-turn-helix motif and shows 29% identity with other putative regulatory genes in clostridium, i.e., uvia from c. perfringens and txer from c. difficile.  we report for the first time the transformation of c. tetani by electroporation,  which permitted us to investigate the function of tetr. overexpression of tetr in c. tetani induced an increase in tetx production and in the level of the corresponding mrna. this indicates that tetr is a transcriptional activator of the tetx gene. overexpression of botr/a (60% identity with tetr at the amino acid level) in c. tetani induced an increase in tetx production comparable to that for overexpression of tetr. however, botr/c (50% identity with tetr at the amino acid level) was less efficient. this supports that tetr positively regulates the tetx  gene in c. tetani and that a conserved mechanism of regulation of the neurotoxin  genes is involved in c. tetani and c. botulinum.

TI  == biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin p, a novel sec-dependent bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium p13 with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  == enterocin p is a new bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13 isolated from a spanish dry-fermented sausage. enterocin p inhibited most of tested spoilage and food-borne gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum. enterocin p is produced during growth in mrs broth from 16 to 45 degrees c; it is heat resistant (60 min at 100 degrees c; 15 min at 121 degrees c) and can withstand exposure to ph between 2.0 and 11.0, freeze-thawing, lyophilization, and long-term storage at 4 and -20 degrees c. the bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, cation-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. the sequence of 43 amino acids of the n terminus was obtained by  edman degradation. dna sequencing analysis of a 755-bp region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames (orfs). the first orf encodes a 71-amino-acid protein containing a hydrophobic n-terminal sec-dependent leader sequence of 27 amino acids followed by the amino acid sequence corresponding to the purified and sequenced enterocin p. the bacteriocin is apparently synthesized as a prepeptide that is cleaved immediately after the val-asp-ala residues (positions -3 to -1), resulting in the mature bacteriocin consisting of 44 amino  acids, and with a theoretical molecular weight of 4,493. a second orf, encoding a putative immunity protein composed of 88 amino acids with a calculated molecular  weight of 9,886, was found immediately downstream of the enterocin p structural gene. enterocin p shows a strong antilisterial activity and has the consensus sequence found in the pediocin-like bacteriocins; however, enterocin p is processed and secreted by the sec-dependent pathway.

TI  == antibody responses to clostridial infection in humans.
AB  == serum antibody responses to the major toxins produced by clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, clostridium septicum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium botulinum have been documented following infection. effective toxoid  vaccines for tetanus and enteritis necroticans due to c. perfringens type c demonstrate the potential of antitoxin responses. although individual serum and mucosal antibody responses to c. difficile enterotoxin (toxin a) vary, one-third  of patients with c. difficile diarrhea develop neutralizing serum antibodies. iga in the serum, not igg, is typically responsible for this neutralization, suggesting a unique role for serum iga in response to c. difficile infection, an  infection that is usually limited to the intestinal mucosa. the relationship of naturally occurring antitoxin antibodies to the clinical course of c. difficile infection is controversial. however, patients with chronic relapsing c. difficile diarrhea and low levels of igg to toxin a have shown clinical responses following intravenous therapy with immune globulin. antibody responses to non-toxin c. difficile proteins also occur, but their significance is only partially known.

TI  == trimeric g proteins control exocytosis in chromaffin cells. go regulates the peripheral actin network and catecholamine secretion by a mechanism involving the small gtp-binding protein rho.
AB  == besides having a role in signal transduction, heterotrimeric g proteins may be involved in membrane trafficking events. in chromaffin cells, go is associated with secretory organelles and its activation by mastoparan inhibits the atp-dependent priming of exocytosis. the effectors by which go controls exocytosis are currently unknown. the subplasmalemmal actin network is one candidate, since it modulates secretion by controlling the movement of secretory  granules to the plasma membrane. in streptolysin-o-permeabilized chromaffin cells, activation of exocytosis produces disassembly of cortical actin filaments. mastoparan blocks the calcium-evoked disruption of cortical actin, and this effect is specifically inhibited by antibodies against galphao and by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cooh-terminal domain of galphao. disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin e and clostridium perfringens iota toxin partially reverses the mastoparan-induced inhibition of secretion. furthermore, the effects of mastoparan on cortical actin and exocytosis are greatly reduced in cells treated with clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates the small g protein rho. we propose that the control exerted by the granule-associated go on exocytosis may be related to effects on the cortical actin network through a sequence of events which eventually involves the participation of rho.

AB  == to analyse the transcription pattern of the five tcda-e genes of the pathogenicity locus (paloc) of clostridium difficile a protocol was established to purify rna from strain vpi10463. transcription analysis of the five tcda-e genes showed that they were all transcribed. in the early exponential phase, a high level of tcdc and low levels of tcda,b,d,e transcripts were detectable; this was inverted in the stationary phase, suggesting that tcdc might have a negative  influence on transcription of the other genes. three transcription initiation sites, one for tcda and two for tcdb were determined by primer extension analysis. readthrough transcripts from outside the locus were not obtainable, so  that parts of the transcription of tcdd, tcdb, tcda and tcdc must occur by monocistronic transcription. within the locus all possible intergenic readthrough transcripts were detectable except that between tcdc and tcda, a stretch of dna interrupted by a functional transcription terminator. thus we found mono- and polycistronic transcription of tcda and tcdb to occur which should lead to production of a surplus of tcda over tcdb transcripts. this would explain the surplus of tcda over tcdb expression observed in vitro. due to its basic nature and similarity to bcna of clostridium perfringens and to orf-22 of clostridium botulinum, tcdd is most probably a regulatory protein with dna-binding properties. on the basis of the presented study we discuss a model for the growth-phase-related, coordinate regulation of toxin expression wherein tcdc has  a negative and tcdd a positive regulatory function on transcription of the tcdd,b,e and tcda genes.

TI  == epidemiology of foodborne diseases: a worldwide review.
AB  == acute foodborne disease infections and intoxications are much more of a concern to governments and the food industry today than a few decades ago. some of the factors that have led to this include the identification of new agents that have  caused life-threatening conditions; the finding that traditional agents are being associated with foods that were of no concern previously: an increasing number of large outbreaks being reported; the impact of foodborne disease on children, the  aging population and the immunocompromised; migrant populations demanding their traditional foods in the countries of settlement; the ease of worldwide shipment  of fresh and frozen food; and the development of new food industries, including aquaculture. however, to meaningfully monitor increases or decreases in foodborne disease requires an effective surveillance system at the local, national and international levels. to date, resources have been limited for most countries and regions to do this, and our current knowledge is based, for the most part, on passive reporting mechanisms. laboratory isolation data and reports of notifiable diseases have some value in observing timely changes in case numbers of some enteric diseases, but they usually do not indicate the reasons for these trends.  special epidemiological studies are useful for the area covered, but it is often  questionable whether they can be extrapolated to other areas or countries. outbreak investigations tell us that a certain set of circumstances led to illness and that another outbreak may occur under similar but not necessarily identical conditions. control programmes have often been triggered by the conclusions from investigations of specific outbreaks. unfortunately, the agent/  food combination leading to illness in many of the reported incidents were not predicted from existing databases, and no doubt foodborne agents will continue to surprise food control agencies in the foreseeable future. nevertheless, data from around the world do show some common elements. salmonella is still the most important agent causing acute foodborne disease, with salmonella enteritidis and  s. typhimurium being of most concern. foods of animal origin, particularly, meat  and eggs, were most often implicated. desserts, ice cream and confectionery items were products also mentioned, but some of these would have egg as a raw or incompletely cooked ingredient. incidents most frequently occurred in homes or restaurants, and the main factors contributing to outbreaks were poor temperature control in preparing, cooking and storing food. clostridium botulinum, salmonella and vtec are more frequently documented in industrialized than in developing countries. etec, epec, shigella, vibrio cholerae and parasites are the main scourges in developing countries, but it is uncertain how many cases are attributed to food, to water or to person-to-person transmission. the apparent decrease of s. aureus and c. perfringens outbreaks in industrialized countries may be related to improved temperature control in the kitchen. an increasing number of illnesses are international in scope, with contamination in a commercial product occurring in one country and affecting persons in several other countries, or tourists being infected abroad and possibly transmitting the  pathogen to others at home. for salmonella, a rapid alert and response coordination is being encouraged through salm-net and other international programs. however, unless such a network is worldwide, tracking clusters of illnesses is going to fall on the countries where the first cases occur, and some of these have very limited resources for investigation and control. it was heartening to see funds recently being allocated to foodborne disease surveillance and control in several industrialized countries, but the same commitment is required by the world health organization for the international community.

AB  == the active site of the enzymatic component (ia) of the clostridium perfringens iota toxin has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis. sequence alignment showed that ia and c3 enzymes display a segment in their c-terminal part which is homologous to that forming the active domain of pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, and escherichia coli thermolabile toxins. this structure consists of a beta-strand and an alpha-helix which forms the nad-binding cavity and which is flanked by two catalytic spatially conserved residues involved in catalysis [domenighini et al. (1994) mol. microbiol. 14, 41-50]. substitutions (arg-295-lys, glu-378-ala, glu-380-asp, and glu-380-ala) induced a drastic decrease in adp-ribosylation and cytotoxic activities, while substitution of the  adjacent arg (arg-296-lys) only partially affected the enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity. these results indicate that arg-295, glu-378 and glu-380 of ia are  involved in the adp-ribosylation activity which is essential for the morphological changes of cells treated with iota toxin.

AB  == an 8 kb segment of the clostridium botulinum nctc 2916 genome 5' to the type a botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames.  four encode components (ha70, ha17, ha34 and ntnh/a) of the progenitor toxin complex. the product of the fifth, orfx, possesses a putative c-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including msmr from streptococcus mutans, uvia from c. perfringens and orftxe1 located upstream of the c. difficile toxin b gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types b, c, d and g botulinum toxins. primer extension and northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [ha34, ha17, ha70] and [ntnh/a, type a toxin gene], with the orfx gene expressed singly. immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the ha34 and ntnh/a genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-attttaggtttacaaaa-3' and 5'-atgttatatgtaa-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type c botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. it is likely that these sequence motifs, together with orfx, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups i, iii and iv c. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.

TI  == cytotoxic effects by microinjection of adp-ribosylated skeletal muscle g-actin in ptk2 cells in the absence of clostridium perfringens iota toxin.
AB  == the adp-ribosylating toxins clostridium botulinum c2 toxin and c. perfringens iota toxin, which adp-ribosylate monomeric g-actin at arg-177 but not the polymeric f-actin, induce depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in cultured  cells. since adp-ribosylated g-actin has properties of a barbed-end-capping protein, we studied whether the adp-ribosylated actin affects the actin cytoskeleton of ptk2 cells even in the absence of adp-ribosylating toxin. skeletal muscle actin was adp-ribosylated by c. perfringens iota toxin and the toxin was removed using an anti-iota toxin antibody. microinjection of adp-ribosylated actin caused retraction of the cell body, redistribution and depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. the finding that adp-ribosylated actin affects per se the actin cytoskeleton explains the cytopathic effects of adp-ribosylating toxins on microfilaments, although f-actin is not directly modified by the toxins.

TI  == probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == dna-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. in this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of salmonella, e. coli, v. cholerae, non-o1 vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and c. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. in food control, dna-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are  enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of dna-based methods. the most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a clostridium botulinum c2 toxin-resistant cell line: evidence for possible involvement of the cellular c2ii receptor in growth regulation.
AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, which consists of the binding component c2ii and  the enzyme component c2i, acts on eukaryotic cells by selective adp-ribosylation  of g-actin. to obtain c2 toxin-resistant cells, we mutagenized cho-k1 cells with  n-nitroso-n-methylurea and selected for c2 resistance. cells which survived the selection procedure with 50 ng of c2i and 100 ng of c2ii per ml were obtained with a frequency of 30 x 10(-6). the colony-forming ability of cho wild-type cells was reduced to 50% with 10 ng of c2i and 20 ng of c2ii per ml. in contrast, the colony-forming ability of the isolated cho mutant cells was not influenced by up to 200 ng of c2i and 400 ng of c2ii per ml. toxin-induced adp-ribosylation of  g-actin was not impaired in lysates of mutant cells. the c2 toxin-resistant phenotype remained sensitive to the cell-rounding activities of cytotoxins from c. perfringens (iota-toxin), c. novyi, c. difficile, and c. botulinum (c3) and to cytochalasin d. binding of component c2ii was impaired in resistant cho cells, suggesting mutation of the toxin cell surface receptor. serum factors protected wild-type cells against the cytotoxic effect of c2 toxin. furthermore, the c2-resistant phenotype correlated with an increased serum dependency. the data suggest that the action of c. botulinum c2 toxin is mediated by its binding and uptake via a cell surface receptor which might be involved in growth regulation.

TI  == characterization of a rabbit serum raised against a botulinum toxin type a binding protein from presynaptic plasma membranes from torpedo electric organ.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxin type a blocks acetylcholine release from the peripheral nervous system. we have previously described a putative botulinum neurotoxin type a receptor of presynaptic plasma membranes from torpedo. the electric organ of torpedo, which is largely enriched in cholinergic nerve endings, is homologous to the neuromuscular junction, allowing us to isolate large scale of presynaptic components. in order to characterize this protein we have raised a polyclonal antibody (a-p140) against this receptor. the antiserum a-p140 recognizes a 140,000 mol. wt band in non-reducing conditions and an 80,000 band in reducing conditions. the immunohistochemistry assay reveals the p140 protein on the ventral face of the electrocytes where the nerve terminals are localized. moreover, a-p140 antiserum recognizes the p140-bont/a complex after binding and cross-linking experiments. in addition, we have immunoprecipitated an in vitro translated product which is closely coincident in mol. wt to the 80,000 band of the receptor.

TI  == organization of the botulinum neurotoxin c1 gene and its associated non-toxic protein genes in clostridium botulinum c 468.
AB  == a 12.3 kb dna fragment encompassing the botulinum neurotoxin c1 (bont/c1) gene and an upstream flanking region was sequenced from clostridium botulinum c 468 phage 1c. the resulting bont/c1 locus includes six genes which are organized into three transcriptional units. cluster 1 encompasses the bont/c1 gene and an upstream gene encoding a non-toxic protein associated with the toxin (antp139/c1). transcriptional analysis revealed that these two genes form an operon; the bont/c1 gene can be transcribed alone or co-transcribed with antp139/c1. cluster 2 encompasses three genes (antp33/c1, antp17/c1 and antp70/c1), which also form an operon. the corresponding proteins are similar to  components of the hemagglutinin complex associated with bont/a and bont/b of c. botulinum a and b. in addition, antp33/c1 is identical to ha-33, an hemagglutinin encoded by c. botulinum c-stockholm phage c-st; antp70/c1 displays some relatedness to c. perfringens enterotoxin. the third transcriptional unit consists of orf-22, which encodes a basic protein showing 29% identity with the gene product of uvia, a plasmid-encoded protein of 22 kda which has been identified as a positive regulator of the bacteriocin production in c. perfringens. orf-22 could be an effector controlling the expression of the bont/c1 and its antp genes in c. botulinum c 468.

TI  == adenine nucleotides regulate adp-ribosylation of membrane-bound actin and actin-binding to membranes.
AB  == adenine nucleotides were shown to increase the adp-ribosylation of actin by clostridium perfringens iota and clostridium botulinum c2 toxin in membranes from human platelets, hamster fat cells, rat liver- and rat brain cells. atp and atp gamma s were the most effective agents with atp showing half-maximal and maximal  effects at about 2 and 10 microm, respectively. the rank order of various adenine nucleotides were atp = atp gamma s > adp > amp-pnp >> amp = camp. guanine nucleotides showed the same rank order of potencies but were less effective than  adenine nucleotides. adenine nucleotides which increased adp-ribosylation were able to release actin from membranes. [32p]adp-ribosylated rabbit skeletal muscle actin, which is unable to polymerize, was used as tool to study membrane-binding  of actin. the [32p]adp-ribosylated actin bound to stripped rat liver membranes in a saturable, time- and temperature-dependent manner. atp inhibited the binding of adp-ribosylated actin with a half-maximal and maximal inhibitory concentration at about 50 and 300 microm, respectively. the data indicate that actin-binding to membranes is prevented or reversed in the presence of adenine nucleotides thereby increasing the accessibility of actin for adp-ribosylation by toxins.

TI  == cellular and molecular actions of binary toxins possessing adp-ribosyltransferase activity.
AB  == clostridial organisms produce a number of binary toxins. thus far, three complete toxins (botulinum, perfringens and spiroforme) and one incomplete toxin (difficile) have been identified. in the case of complete toxins, there is a heavy chain component (mr approximately 100,000) that binds to target cells and helps create a docking site for the light chain component (mr approximately 50,000). the latter is an enzyme that possesses mono(adp-ribosyl)transferase activity. the toxins appear to proceed through a three step sequence to exert their effects, including a binding step, an internalization step and an intracellular poisoning step. the substrate for the toxins is g-actin. by virtue  of adp-ribosylating monomeric actin, the toxins prevent polymerization as well as promoting depolymerization. the most characteristic cellular effect of the toxins is alteration of the cytoskeleton, which leads directly to changes in cellular morphology and indirectly to changes in cell function (e.g. release of chemical mediators). binary toxins capable of modifying actin are likely to be useful tools in the study of cell biology.

AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin and clostridium perfringens iota toxin belong to a novel family of actin adp-ribosylating toxins. adp-ribosylation of actin inhibits actin polymerization and g-actin-associated atpase activity. the adp-form of actin is adp-ribosylated at a higher rate than actin with bound atp. adp-ribosylation of actin is reversible, a reaction, which is accompanied by reconstitution of actin atpase activity.

TI  == purification of the clostridium spiroforme binary toxin and activity of the toxin on hep-2 cells.
AB  == the two components sa (mr, 44,000) and sb (mr, 92,000) of clostridium spiroforme  toxin were identified and characterized. serological data permitted the identification of two groups of actin adp-ribosylating clostridial toxins. the first consists of only c. botulinum c2. the second group includes spiroforme toxin, iota toxin of c. perfringens e, and an enzyme called cdt found in one strain of c. difficile, antibodies against which cross-react with all of the members of both groups. c. spiroforme toxin acted on cells by disrupting microfilaments by adp-ribosylation of g actin. toxicity was not blocked by 10 or  20 mm ammonium chloride and was only moderately inhibited by 30 mm nh4cl. inhibition of coated-pit formation in hep-2 cells by potassium depletion strongly protected against the effect of c. spiroforme toxin. toxicity was not blocked by  incubation of hep-2 cells and spiroforme toxin at 15 degrees c. these results suggest that this new binary toxin enters cells via the coated-pit-coated-vesicle pathway and might reach the cytoplasm at the same time as or before transfer to early endosomes.

TI  == adp-ribosylation of actin causes increase in the rate of atp exchange and inhibition of atp hydrolysis.
AB  == adp-ribosylation of skeletal muscle actin by clostridium perfringens iota toxin increased the rate of exchange of actin-bound [gamma-32p]atp by unlabelled atp about twofold. increased exchange rates were observed with atp and atp[gamma s],  much less with adp but not with amp or nad. adp-ribosylation of skeletal muscle actin reduced "basal" and mg2+ (1 mm)-induced atp hydrolysis by about 80%. similar inhibition of atp hydrolysis was observed with liver actin adp-ribosylated by clostridium botulinum c2 toxin. the data indicate that adp-ribosylation of actin at arg-177 largely affects the atp-binding and atpase activity.

TI  == production by clostridium spiroforme of an iotalike toxin that possesses mono(adp-ribosyl)transferase activity: identification of a novel class of adp-ribosyltransferases.
AB  == clostridium spiroforme iotalike toxin produced time- and concentration-dependent  incorporation of adp-ribose into homo-poly-l-arginine. polyasparagine, polyglutamic acid, polylysine, and agmatine were poor substrates. enzyme activity was associated with the light-chain polypeptide of the toxin. the heavy chain did not possess adp-ribosyltransferase activity, nor did it enhance or inhibit activity of the light chain. in broken-cell assays, the toxin acted mainly on g-actin, rather than f-actin. a single adp-ribose group was transferred to each substrate molecule (g-actin). the enzyme was heat sensitive, had a ph optimum in  the range of 7 to 8, was inhibited by high concentrations of nicotinamide, and was reversibly denatured by urea and guanidine. physiological levels of nucleotides (amp, adp, atp, and adp-ribose) and cations (na+, k+, ca2+, and mg2+) were not very active as enzyme inhibitors. the toxin was structurally and functionally similar to clostridium botulinum type c2 toxin and clostridium perfringens iota toxin. when combined with previous findings, the data suggest that a new class of mono(adp-ribosyl)ating toxins has been found and that these agents belong to a related and possibly homologous series of binary toxins.

TI  == adp-ribosylated actin caps the barbed ends of actin filaments.
AB  == the mode of action on actin polymerization of skeletal muscle actin adp-ribosylated on arginine 177 by perfringens iota toxin was investigated. adp-ribosylated actin decreased the rate of nucleated actin polymerization at substoichiometric ratios of adp-ribosylated actin to monomeric actin. adp-ribosylated actin did not tend to copolymerize with actin. actin filaments were depolymerized by the addition of adp-ribosylated actin. the maximal monomer  concentration reached by addition of adp-ribosylated actin was similar to the critical concentration of the pointed ends of actin filaments. adp-ribosylated actin had no effect on the rate of polymerization of gelsolin-capped actin filaments which polymerize at the pointed ends. the results suggest that adp-ribosylated actin acts as a capping protein which binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments to inhibit polymerization. based on an analysis of the depolymerizing effect of adp-ribosylated actin, the equilibrium constant for binding of adp-ribosylated actin to the barbed ends of actin filaments was determined to be about 10(8) m-1. as actin is adp-ribosylated by perfringens iota toxin and by botulinum c2 toxin, it appears that conversion of actin into a capping protein by adp-ribosylation is a pathophysiological reaction catalyzed by bacterial toxins which ultimately leads to inhibition of actin assembly.

TI  == actin-specific adp-ribosyltransferase produced by a clostridium difficile strain.
AB  == by screening possible adp-ribosyltransferase activities in culture supernatants from various clostridium species, we have found one clostridium difficile strain  (cd196) (isolated in our laboratory) that is able to produce, in addition to toxins a and b, a new adp-ribosyltransferase that was shown to covalently modify  cell actin as clostridium botulinum c2 or clostridium perfringens e iota toxins do. the molecular weight of the cd196 adp-ribosyltransferase (cdt) was determined to be 43 kilodaltons, and its isoelectric point was 7.8. no cytotoxic activity on vero cells or lethal activity upon injection in mice was associated with this enzyme. cdt was neither related to c. difficile a or b toxins nor to c. botulinum c2 toxin component i. however, vero cells cultivated in the presence of c. difficile b toxin had a lower amount of actin able to be adp-ribosylated by cdt or c2 toxin in vitro. antibodies raised against cdt reacted by immunoblot analysis with a 43-kilodalton protein of c. perfringens type e culture supernatant producing the iota toxin.

TI  == clostridium spiroforme toxin is a binary toxin which adp-ribosylates cellular actin.
AB  == we have purified from clostridium spiroforme strain 246 an heterogeneous population of proteins (sa) ranging from 43 to 47 kilodaltons exhibiting adp-ribosyl transferase activity as do c. botulinum c2 toxin component i or the ia chain of c. perfringens e iota toxin. c. spiriforme sa had alone no activity upon injection in mice or inoculated to vero cells. when spiroforme adp ribosyl transferase were mixed with a trypsin activated protein (sb) separated from c. spiroforme bacterial supernatant, a lethal effect in mice and cytotoxicity on vero cells were recorded. the sa cross-reacted immunologically with either the light chain of c. perfringens e iota toxin or the adp-ribosyl transferase from c. difficile 196 strain. no immunological relatedness was observed between sa and c2 toxin component i. c. spiroforme toxin is thus another binary toxin close to iota.

TI  == egg yolk paste for determining some food poisoning bacteria.
AB  == egg yolk, aseptically prepared from fresh eggs, was partially dehydrated with a 40% high fructose corn syrup solution, and 10% salt was added. this salted yolk paste was added to mannitol salt agar for the detection of staphylococcus aureus, to nacl-glycine kim and goepfert medium for detection of bacillus cereus, to clostridium welchii agar for detection of c. perfringens, and to gifu anaerobic medium for detection of c. botulinum. these food poisoning bacteria showed the same lecithovitellin (lv) reaction on these media as on the same media prepared with fresh egg yolk. the yolk paste could be stored at -20 c without freezing and did not show any bacterial growth after holding at 25 c for 30 days. the increased salt content resulted from the addition of salted yolk paste to the media did not inhibit the growth of the food poisoning bacteria used in these experiments. for the identification of the food poisoning bacteria used in this work, and which give a lv reaction, salted yolk paste is more convenient to use than yolk separated from fresh shell eggs.

TI  == production of toxic antigens in dialyzed cultures of microorganisms.
AB  == data on the production of clostridial toxins in dialyzed cultures are summarized. principal modifications of this cultivation technique suitable for both research  and production are shown. if toxins are released from the cells by autolysis (neurotoxins of clostridium tetani, c. botulinum; lethal factors of c. novyi and  c. sordellii), a 10-fold increase of the antigen concentration in filtrates of dialyzed cultures is found in comparison with normal cultures. if toxins are excreted already during growth (lethal factors of c. perfringens type a, c. septicum), the positive effect of the technique is less significant. a dialyzed culture ensures a well-balanced production of toxic filtrates that contain highly concentrated, relatively pure and strongly immunogenic antigens.

TI  == histopathological effect of botulinum c2 toxin on mouse intestines.
AB  == botulinum c2 toxin has histopathological activity in the mouse intestine and induces fluid accumulation in intestinal loops. the toxin caused degenerative and necrotic changes in the intestinal mucosa: intracellular vacuolization of epithelial cells, desquamation and necrosis of the villous epithelium, intercellular edema, and infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes. the detectable changes in the morphology of the intestinal mucosa preceded the increase in fluid accumulation in intestinal loops. intraluminal injection of botulinum c2 toxin also induced the leakage of plasma protein into the intestinal lumen as determined by the extravasation of evans blue. in contrast to botulinum  c2 toxin, cholera and clostridium perfringens enterotoxin controls caused a very  slight protein leakage, although these toxins induced marked fluid accumulation in intestinal loops. the results indicate that the mode of action of botulinum c2 toxin in eliciting the secretory response is distinguishable from those of cholera and c. perfringens enterotoxins and suggest that botulinum c2 toxin induces the secretory response by cytopathic effect(s) on the epithelial cells of the intestine.

TI  == the clinical significance, taxonomy and special methodological problems of the pathogenic clostridia.

AB  == foods can serve as vehicles of many pathogenic and toxigenic agents of disease. bacterial agents comprise three groups: 1) those that grow in the food and produce an active toxin before consumption (e.g., clostridium botulinium); 2) those that merely exist as contaminants in the food but are able to initiate infection when swallowed (e.g., salmonella spp.); and 3) those that multiply and  produce large numbers of vegetative cells in the food, then release an active enterotoxin when they sporulate in the gut. a few parasitic (e.g., trichinella spiralis) and viral agents (e.g., hepatitis a) also can be transmitted by food. botulinum poisoning is the deadliest foodborne disease. the potential danger of botulism from cured meats is a major factor in the argument over use of nitrites  as meat curing agents. a new disease called infant botulism has been recognized since 1976. apparently it is not foodborne but results from intraintestinal growth of c. botulinum in very young infants. salmonellosis is the most important of the foodborne diseases from the standpoint of overall human health. the primary vehicles are contaminated raw meat, poultry, and eggs. faulty food handling practices are responsible for most food poisoning in the united states.

TI  == neuraminidase production by clostridia.
AB  == the production of neuraminidase (ec 3.2.1.18) by a range of clostridial species was investigated with techniques previously developed to distinguish neuraminidase-negative and neuraminidase-positive strains of clostridium perfringens (welchii). large amounts of extracellular neuraminidase were produced by representative strains of c. perfringens and c. septicum in the test media. under similar conditions, two strains each of c. chauvoei and c. tertium were found to produce small amounts of the enzyme. all of 12 strains of c. sordellii were clearly shown to produce neuraminidase, often in large amounts, but none of  five strains of the closely related but non-pathogenic c. bifermentans had demonstrable neuraminidase activity. no neuraminidase was produced by c. novyi (oedematiens) types a-d (10 strains), c. tetani (6), c. botulinum types a, b, c or e (4), c. sporogenes (4), c. histolyticum (4) or by single strains of five other clostridial species. clostridial neuraminidase was predominantly extracellular and was not calcium-dependent. the investigation took account of variations in growth and enzyme production in different media. it was necessary to prolong the neuraminidase-assay reaction time to 24 h and to monitor for the presence of nan-aldolase (ec 4.1.3.3) to define true negatives. it is suggested that neuraminidase production may be of value in taxonomic studies and that its production by several pathogenic species of clostridia may be of interest in studies of pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == recovery of clostridia on catalase-treated plating media.
AB  == four plating media commonly used for culturing clostridia were tested for their ability to support growth of several clostridium species after storage of the plates for 1 to 10 days at 4 and 25 degrees c with and without subsequent addition of catalase. liver-veal (lv) agar and brain heart infusion (bhi) agar rapidly became incapable of supporting growth after storage without added catalase, whereas shahidi ferguson perfringens agar base and brewer anaerobic agar were less affected. plate counts of vegetative cells of nine of the less fastidious clostridium species on untreated lv and bhi agars, stored for 3 days at 4 degrees c, were 60 to 90% lower than counts on catalase-treated media. counts on shahidi ferguson perfringens agar base were only 1 to 24% lower on untreated medium with the same species. addition of 500 u of purified beef liver  catalase to the surface of the 3-day-old agars before inoculation resulted in substantial restoration of the ability of the media to support colony formation from vegetative cells except with the most strictly anaerobic species (nonproteolytic c. botulinum types b, e, and f, and c. novyii types a and b). a similar response was obtained with spores of the less fastidious species on catalase-treated media. our results suggest that inhibition of most clostridium species on lv and bhi agars may be due to accumulation of peroxide during preparation, storage, and incubation of the media, and also suggest that the presence of glucose in these media is a major factor contributing to their inability to support growth. it is believed that the addition of exogenous catalase prevents the accumulation of peroxide(s), thus allowing colony formation from vegetative cells of the clostridia under what would otherwise be unsuitable  cultural conditions.

TI  == quantitative chemical analyses and antigenic properties of peptidoglycans from clostridium botulinum and other clostridia.
AB  == the cell wall peptodoglycans were isolated from clostridium botulinum and some other species of the genus clostridium by hot formamide extraction and their quantitative chemical composition and antigenic properties were determined. the petidoglycan of c. botulinum type e was found to be a diaminopimelic acid (dap)-containing type composed of glucosamine, muramic acid, glutamic acid, alanine and dap in the molar ratio of 0.76:0.78:1.00:1.88:0.81. all other types of c. botulinum and clostridium sporogenes also belonged to the same peptidoglycan type. the peptidoglycans of clostridium bifermentans and clostridium histoloyticum contained dap but they differed from those of c. botulinum in the molar ratio of alanine to glutamic acid. the peptidoglycan of clostridium perfringens was composed of glutamic acid, alanine, dap and glycine in the molar ratio of 1.00:1.64:0.94:0.90. on the other hand, the peptidoglycan of clostridium septicum was found to contain lysine instead of dap and the molar  ratio was 1.00:1.41:0.96 for glutamic acid, alanine and lysine. in spite of the difference in amino acid composition of peptidoglycans among the clostridia, the  quantitative precipitin test demonstrated that antiserum against c. botulinum type e peptidoglycan cross-reacted with the peptidoglycans from other clostridia  as well as various types of c. botulinum.

AB  == thirty-one soil samples were examined for the presence of organisms capable of inhibiting growth and toxin production of strains of clostridium botulinum type a. such organisms were found in eight samples of soil. inhibiting strains of c. perfringens were found in five samples, of c. sporogenes in three and of bacillus cereus in three. three of the c. perfringens strains produced an inhibitor effective on all 11 strains of c. botulinum type a against which they were tested, seven of eight proteolytic type b strains, one nonproteolytic type b strain, five of nine type e strains and all seven type f strains, whether proteolytic or nonproteolytic. they did not inhibit any of 26 type c strains, 6 type d strains, 4 type e strains, or 24 c. sporogenes strains. in mixed culture,  an inhibitor strain of c. perfringens repressed growth and toxin production by a  c. botulinum type a strain even though it was outnumbered by the latter about 40  times. it also repressed growth and toxin production of c. botulinum in mixed culture of soils in which this latter organism naturally occurred when cooked meat medium but not when trypticase medium was used.

TI  == taxonomy of the clostridia: ribosomal ribonucleic acid homologies among the species.
AB  == rrna homologies have been determined on reference strains representing 56 species of clostridium. competition experiments using tritium-labelled 23s rrna were employed. the majority of the species had dna with 27 to 28% guanine plus cytosine (%gc). these fell into rrna homology groups i and ii, which were well defined, and a third group which consisted of species which did not belong in groups i and ii. species whose dna was 41 to 45% gc comprised a fourth group. thirty species were placed into rrna homology group i on the basis of having 50%  or greater homology with clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. carnis, c. sporogenes, c. novyi or c. pasteurianum. ten subgroups were delineated in homology group i. species in each subgroup either had high homology with a particular reference species or a similar pattern of homologies to all of the reference organisms. the eleven species in rrna homology group ii had 69% or greater homology to c. lituseburense. species in groups i and ii had intergroup homologies of 20 to 40%. the six species in group ii had very low homologies with groups i and ii. negligible homology also resulted when five of the species were  tested against the sixth, c. ramosum. the five species having dna with 41 to 45%  gc were c. innocuum, c. sphenoides, c. indolis, c. barkeri and c. orotic um. little rrna homology was apparent between c. innocuum and the other high % gc species or with several bacillus species having similar %gc dna. correlations between homology results and phenotypic characteristics are discussed.

TI  == common mesophilic anaerobes, including clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, in 21 soil specimens.
AB  == a relatively rich medium was markedly superior to a dilute medium for the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from soil. the obligate anaerobes isolated from 21 soil samples were all clostridia and the counts ranged from 2.7 x 10-2 to 3.3  x 10-6 per g. the organisms most frequently isolated were clostridium subterminate, c. sordelii, c. sporogenes, c. indolis, c. bifermentans, c. mangenoti, and c. perfringens. seventeen other species were also recognized but almost one-third of the isolates could not be identified with any known species of clostridium. c. botulinum type a was demonstrated in six soil samples, and type b in one. these soils were neutral to alkaline in reaction (average ph 7.9)  and low in organic matter content (1.4%). the association of c. botulinum types a and b with neutral to alkaline soils was statistically significant (p = 0.001) as was their association with soils low in organic matter (p = 0.005). c. botulinum  types e and f were found in one soil sample, ph 4.5, with organic matter 13.7%. c. tetani was isolated from two soil samples, both of intermediate ph value and higher than average organic matter content.

TI  == inhibition of protease production of various bacteria by ammonium salts: its effect on toxin production and virulence.
AB  == production of protease by many bacteria was found to be inhibited by ammonium salts, and the enzyme production was more sensitive to the salts than was growth  of the organisms. inhibition of protease production by some pathogenic bacteria may result in the recognition of an exotoxin which otherwise would have been digested by the protease. in the case of pseudomonas aeruginosa, qualitatively different toxicities could be demonstrated in the culture fluids, depending on the presence or absence of protease in such a fluid. the toxicity of the culture  in the presence of a high titer of protease may be due primarily to the protease, whereas the toxicity exhibited in the absence of protease could be due to proteinacious exotoxin. producers of high titers of protease tended to be less virulent in vivo than producers of low titers of the enzyme, which exert their toxicities by a separate exotoxin.

AB  == food poisoning caused by the ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins is considered in relation to comparative symptoms, procedures for extraction and purification of the causal toxins, their chemistry, serology, assay procedures and pharmacology, in so far as these are known.the bacteria discussed in this context are clostridium botulinum, c. perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and vibrio parahemolyticus. the possible roles of the enterococci, proteus, e. coli and of unknown species, in relation to production of non-antigenic toxic substances, are discussed briefly.requirements for prevention of the various forms of bacterial food poisoning are outlined.

TI  == pouch method for the isolation and enumeration of clostridia.
AB  == an anaerobic film-pouch method has been developed for the isolation and enumeration of clostridia. fabrication of the pouch is described. counts of spore suspensions of putrefactive anaerobe 3679 and of clostridium botulinum strains 41-b and 33-a in pouches were compared with those obtained by anaerobic-jar and agar-deep techniques. statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in favor of the pouch over the tube and anaerobic-jar methods. tests performed with  c. welchii, both in spore suspension and added to chicken pot pie in culture form, also demonstrated the pouch to be at least as proficient as the other, more cumbersome, techniques.

TI  == lysosomal disruption by bacterial toxins.
AB  == bernheimer, alan w. (new york university school of medicine, new york), and lois  l. schwartz. lysosomal disruption by bacterial toxins. j. bacteriol. 87:1100-1104. 1964.-seventeen bacterial toxins were examined for capacity (i) to  disrupt rabbit leukocyte lysosomes as indicated by decrease in turbidity of lysosomal suspensions, and (ii) to alter rabbit liver lysosomes as measured by release of beta-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase. staphylococcal alpha-toxin, clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin, and streptolysins o and s affected lysosomes in both systems. staphylococcal beta-toxin, leucocidin and enterotoxin, shiga neurotoxin, serratia endotoxin, diphtheria toxin, tetanus neurotoxin, c. botulinum type a toxin, and c. perfringens epsilon-toxin were not active in either system. staphylococcal delta-toxin, c. histolyticum collagenase, crude c.  perfringens beta-toxin, and crude anthrax toxin caused lysosomal damage in only one of the test systems. there is a substantial correlation between the hemolytic property of a toxin and its capacity to disrupt lysosomes, lending support to the concept that erythrocytes and lysosomes are bounded by similar membranes.

TI  == sporulation of clostridium botulinum types a, b, and e, clostridium perfringens,  and putrefactive anaerobe 3679 in dialysis sacs.
AB  == schneider, morris d. (quartermaster food and container institute for the armed forces, u.s. army, chicago, ill.), nicholas grecz, and abe anellis. sporulation of clostridium botulinum types a, b, and e, clostridium perfringens, and putrefactive anaerobe 3679 in dialysis sacs. j. bacteriol. 85:126-133. 1963.-concentrated cultures of spores of clostridium botulinum type a (33a, 37a), b (41b, 51b), and e (strain vh), c. perfringens (strain e), and putrefactive anaerobe 3679 were prepared in intussuscepted cellulose dialysis tubing. the apparatus consisted of a telescoped cellulose bag immersed into a suitable sporulation medium in a large pyrex tube. the initial inoculum was a heavy suspension in physiological saline solution of either vegetative cells or heat-shocked spores. the seed material was introduced into the interior of the dialysis bag. maximal spore populations were obtained within 10 to 12 days. strains of c. botulinum type e and c. perfringens, known for their poor sporulation in conventional cultures, gave good spore crops in the dialysis bag.  some crops were of the order of 10(10) and 10(11) viable spores per liter of medium. the spores produced in the dialysis bag were conspicuously large, particularly after incubation for 20 to 30 days. observations of the characteristics of spores formed in telescoped bags indicate that two highly resistant strains of c. botulinum, 33a and 41b, were apparently less resistant to gamma rays than spores of the same strains produced in identical media in conventional cultures.
