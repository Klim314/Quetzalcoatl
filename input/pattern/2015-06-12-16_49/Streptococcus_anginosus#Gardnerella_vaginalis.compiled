TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  - The physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. This prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. Semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and/or U. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) CCU ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. In standard aerobic cultures, Gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and Streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). Ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered, high (> or =10(4) CCU ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) CCU ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. Of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. This study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of U. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for U. urealyticum should be raised to > or =10(4) CFU ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before any treatment.
TI  - Anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including Gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal G. vaginalis in both genders. From a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. Inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. Several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. At least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. Most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). S. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, Streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and Haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. G. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.
