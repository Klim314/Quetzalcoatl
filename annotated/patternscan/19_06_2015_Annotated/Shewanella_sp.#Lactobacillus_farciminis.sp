TI  == characterisation of volatile compounds produced by bacteria isolated from the spoilage flora of cold-smoked salmon.
AB  == this study investigated the volatile compounds produced by bacteria belonging to  nine different bacterial groups: lactobacillus sake, l. farciminis, l. alimentarius, carnobacterium piscicola, aeromonas sp., shewanella putrefaciens, brochothrix thermosphacta, photobacterium phosphoreum and enterobacteriaceae isolated from cold-smoked salmon. each bacterial group was represented by several strains. in addition, combinations of the groups were examined as well. sterile blocks of cold-smoked salmon were inoculated, vacuum-packed and stored at 6 degrees c. after 40 days of storage at 6 degrees c, aerobic viable count and ph were recorded, the volatile fraction of the samples was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms), and spoilage was assessed by sensory evaluation. among the 81 volatile compounds identified by gc-ms, 30 appeared to be released as a result of bacterial metabolism. some of the effects of inoculated bacterial strains on the composition of the volatile fraction seemed to be characteristic of certain bacterial species. sensory analysis showed relationships between bacteria, the composition of the volatile fraction and the  organoleptic quality of smoked salmon.
