TI  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. one factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8, cxcl-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. the purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. il-8 gene expression and protein production in ht-29 cells were evaluated by real-time pcr  and elisa, respectively. pre-incubation of ht-29 cells with lactobacillus kefir im002, bifidobacterium adolescentis frp 61, bifidobacterium longum frp 68 and frp 69, bifidobacterium breve frp 334, and leuconostoc mesenteroides im080 significantly inhibited il-8 secretion induced by salmonella typhimurium dt104. co-culture of selected probiotics and salmonella typhimurium dt104 reduced il-8 production, while potential probiotics and lab had no effect on il-8 secretion in ht-29 cells preincubated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 prior to adding probiotics. lactobacillus kefir im002 supernatant also significantly reduced il-8 production. in conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and lab modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == purification, amino acid sequence and characterization of the class iia bacteriocin weissellin a, produced by weissella paramesenteroides dx.
AB  == weissella paramesenteroides dx has been shown to produce a 4450-da class iia bacteriocin, weissellin a, composed of 43 amino acids with the sequence knygngvycnkhkcsvdwatfsaniannsvamagltggnagn. the bacteriocin shares 68% similarity with leucocin c from leuconostoc mesenteroides. computational analyses predict that the bacteriocin is a hydrophobic molecule with a beta-sheet type conformation. weissellin a exhibited various levels of activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested, but was not active against salmonella enterica enteritidis. the antimicrobial activity was not associated with target-cell lysis. the bacteriocin retained activity after exposure to 121 degrees c for 60 min or to -20 degrees c for 6months, and to ph 2.0-10.0. it was not sensitive to  trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, pepsin and papain, but was inactivated by proteinase k. at a dissolved oxygen concentration of 50%, weissellin a was produced with growth-associated kinetics. the properties of weissellin a make this bacteriocin  a potentially suitable agent for food and feed preservation.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == efficacy of leuconostoc mesenteroides (atcc 13146) isomaltooligosaccharides as a  poultry prebiotic.
AB  == the complex dietary carbohydrates, called prebiotics, have been used to control salmonella and improve intestinal bacterial balance in broilers. leuconostoc mesenteroides (atcc 13146) isomaltooligosaccharides (imo) stimulate growth of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus and are not used by salmonella or escherichia coli. we tested the efficacy of these imo as a prebiotic. imo, compared with fructooligosaccharides (fos) as sole carbon source, promoted growth of chicken cecal isolates and bifidobacterium. cecal isolates and salmonella typhimurium grown in mixed culture on imo reduced the salmonella population. cecal isolates grown on imo showed higher viable counts and faster growth than salmonella, indicating a potential value for these oligomers for poultry intestinal microflora modification.

TI  == interactive inhibition of meat spoilage and pathogenic bacteria by lysozyme, nisin and edta in the presence of nitrite and sodium chloride at 24 degrees c.
AB  == to develop a nisin- and lysozyme-based antimicrobial treatment for use with processed ham and bologna, in vitro experiments were conducted to determine whether inhibition enhancing interactions occur between the antimicrobials lysozyme, chrisin (a commercial nisin preparation), edta, nacl and nano(2). inhibitory interactions were observed between a number of agents when used against specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. the observed interactions included lysozyme with edta (enterococcus faecalis and weissella viridescens), chrisin with edta (all gram-positive organisms), edta with nacl (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia grimesii), edta with nitrite (e. coli, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium), chrisin with nitrite (lc. mesenteroides, l. monocytogenes), and nacl with nitrite (s. typhimurium, shewanella putrefaciens).  previous reports have described interactions between nisin with edta that resulted in enhanced antimicrobial effect against gram-negative bacteria, or lysozyme with nisin against gram-positive bacteria. these interactions were not observed in these experiments. we observed that unlike previous studies, these experiments were conducted on growing cells in nutrient broth, rather than under  conditions of nutrient limitation. we propose that screening of antimicrobials for use in food systems in nutrient-deficient systems is inappropriate and that new protocols should be developed.

TI  == glucooligosaccharides from leuconostoc mesenteroides b-742 (atcc 13146): a potential prebiotic.
AB  == there is an emerging market for functional oligosaccharides for use in foods. currently, technology for the production of oligosaccharides is limited to extraction from plant sources, acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides or synthesis by transglycosylation reactions. oligosaccharides can also be produced  using a leuconostoc fermentation and restricting the polymer size by addition of  maltose. maltose limits the dextransucrase reaction, yielding high concentrations of alpha-glucooligosaccharides. branched oligomers produced by this process were  readily catabolized by bifidobacteria and lactobacilli but were not readily utilized by either salmonella sp. or escherichia coli, pointing toward their use  in intestinal microflora modification.

TI  == effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
AB  == the impact of a novel type of modified atmosphere (ma), referred to as high o2-ma, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. pure cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter agglomerans, aureobacterium strain 27, candida guilliermondii, c. sake, salmonella typhimurium, salm. enteritidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees c under an atmosphere composed of o2 (80 or 90%, balanced with n2), co2 (10 or 20%, balanced with n2), or a combination of both gases. in general, exposure to high o2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while co2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in  combination. with minimally-processed vegetables, where co2 levels of around 20%  or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high o2 and 10-20% co2 may provide adequate suppression of  microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.
