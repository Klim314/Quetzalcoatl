mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth.
neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid.
the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism.
the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed.
neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for growth.
this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid.
because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.
