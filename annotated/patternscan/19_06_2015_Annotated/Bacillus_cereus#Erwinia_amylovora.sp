TI  == antimicrobial and genotoxicity effects of zero-valent iron nanoparticles.
AB  == background: in a world of nanotechnology, the first concern is the potential environmental impact of nanoparticles. an efficient way to estimate nanotoxicity  is to monitor the responses of bacteria exposed to these particles. objectives: the current study explored the antimicrobial properties of nzvi (zero-valent iron nanoparticles) on the gram-negative bacterial systems erwinia amylovora, xanthomonas oryzae and the gram-positive bacterial systems bacillus cereus and streptomyces spp. the genotoxicity potential of nzvi was also assayed. materials  and methods: the toxicity of nzvi was tested by two different methods: growing bacteria in liquid (broth dilution) and agar media (challenge test) containing different nzvi concentrations for 24-72 hours. the genotoxicity of nzvi was assessed using the preincubation version of the ames test. results: the lowest concentrations of nzvi that inhibited the visible growth (mic) of e. amylovora, x. oryzae, b. cereus and streptomyces spp. were 625, 550, 1250 and 1280 ppm, respectively. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) for e. amylovora and x. oryzae were 10,000 and 5,000 ppm of nzvi, respectively. mbc was not observed for the gram positive bacteria. no bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects were observed for oxidized nzvi. mutant frequency did not increase according to the vehicle control at the concentrations assayed, indicating a lack of mutagenicity  associated with nzvi. conclusions: nzvi nanoparticles are not mutagenic at low concentrations, therefore they can be used without detrimental effects on soil bacteria.
