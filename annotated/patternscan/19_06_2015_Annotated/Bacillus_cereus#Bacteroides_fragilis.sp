TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == evaluation of the sterility testing process of hematopoietic stem cells at canadian blood services.
AB  == background: sterility testing of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) at the canadian  blood services stem cell laboratory is performed using bact/alert aerobic (sa) culture bottles. this study was conducted to verify the efficacy of this method and to assess the use of the bact/alert aerobic (bpa) and anaerobic (bpn) culture bottles for microbial testing of hscs. study design and methods: hsc products, including cryopreserved apheresis peripheral blood, marrow, and cord blood and fresh cord blood, were spiked with four aerobic organisms including staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida  albicans, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis at a target concentration of 100  colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. one to 2 ml of pre- and postspiked samples was inoculated into sa, bpa, and bpn bottles in duplicate and incubated for 5 to 10 days. the presence of the testing organisms in positive culture bottles was confirmed by plating on blood agar. results: the bact/alert system detected the aerobic organisms in all hscs in sa and bpa bottles within 34.1 hours while b. fragilis was detected only in bpn bottles within 68.6 hours. the mean recovered concentration of microorganisms in the hsc products ranged from 55 to 352 cfus/ml with the exception of b. cereus, which was greater than 10(3) cfus/ml. conclusion: this study shows that the current sterility testing process at the canadian blood services stem cell laboratory detected the tested aerobic but not  the anaerobic microbial contaminants in hscs. the ability of the bact/alert system using bpa and bpn bottles to detect bacterial contamination in hscs was also demonstrated.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == role of zinc content on the catalytic efficiency of b1 metallo beta-lactamases.
AB  == metallo beta-lactamases (mbetal) are enzymes naturally evolved by bacterial strains under the evolutionary pressure of beta-lactam antibiotic clinical use. they have a broad substrate spectrum and are resistant to all the clinically useful inhibitors, representing a potential risk of infection if massively disseminated. the mbetal scaffold is designed to accommodate one or two zinc ions able to activate a nucleophilic hydroxide for the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. the role of zinc content on the binding and reactive mechanism of action has been the subject of debate and still remains an open issue despite the large  amount of data acquired. we report herein a study of the reaction pathway for binuclear ccra from bacteroides fragilis using density functional theory based quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics dynamical modeling. ccra is the prototypical binuclear enzyme belonging to the b1 mbetal family, which includes several harmful chromosomally encoded and transferable enzymes. the involvement of a second zinc ion in the catalytic mechanism lowers the energetic barrier for  beta-lactam hydrolysis, preserving the essential binding features found in mononuclear b1 enzymes (bcii from bacillus cereus) while providing a more efficient single-step mechanism. overall, this study suggests that uptake of a second equivalent zinc ion is evolutionary favored.

TI  == thiols as classical and slow-binding inhibitors of imp-1 and other binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of a variety of thiol compounds on the function of binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases, with a particular focus on imp-1 from pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been investigated. thiol inhibitors, depending on their structural features, fall into two categories, one in which inhibition at neutral ph was instantaneous and the other in which inhibition was time-dependent. while mercaptans with anionic substituents in the vicinity of their sh groups exhibited the former type of inhibition, neutral thiols appear to induce a slow, time-dependent isomerization of the initially formed ei complex to a tighter ei complex. kinetic parameters describing the latter process were obtained by fitting progress curves of substrate hydrolysis using standard and numerical procedures. the failure of charged thiols to exhibit slow binding is suggested to be due to a rapid isomerization of the initial ei complex. slow binding in the case of neutral thiols was observed only below ph 8. studies on the ph dependence of catalysis by imp-1 revealed that (i) enzyme inactivation at  low ph is a slow process with presumably two groups with a pk(a) of approximately 5.2 in the protein being responsible for the loss of activity, (ii) inhibition by thiols is independent of ph between ph 5 and 9, and (iii) an apparent enhancement of the catalytic activity of imp-1 by thiols occurs at ph <5. the last mentioned  phenomenon is explained by a model in which mercaptans retard the proton-dependent isomerization of the enzyme. studies on the thiol-mediated inhibition of the binuclear forms of bacteroides fragilis (ccra) and bacillus cereus (bcii strain 5/b/6) metallo-beta-lactamase have revealed that while ccra was instantaneously albeit moderately inhibited by mercaptans, bcii mimicked imp-1 in its interaction with thiols. these differences are proposed to be due partly to the structural divergence of these proteins in the vicinity of zn2.

TI  == identification of a series of tricyclic natural products as potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == this work describes the discovery and characterization of a novel series of tricyclic natural product-derived metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. natural product screening of the bacillus cereus ii enzyme identified an extract from a strain of chaetomium funicola with inhibitory activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. sb236050, sb238569, and sb236049 were successfully extracted and purified from this extract. the most active of these compounds was  sb238569, which possessed k(i) values of 79, 17, and 3.4 microm for the bacillus  cereus ii, pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1, and bacteroides fragilis cfia metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively, yet none of the compounds exhibited any inhibitory activity against the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (50% inhibitory concentration > 1,000 microm). the lack of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme and serine beta-lactamases demonstrated the selective nature of these compounds. the crystal structure of sb236050 complexed in the active site of cfia has been obtained to a resolution of 2.5 a. sb236050 exhibits key polar interactions with lys184, asn193, and his162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. sb236050 and sb238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. eight micrograms of sb236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the mic of meropenem for two clinical isolates of b. fragilis producing cfia, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (mic < or = 4 microg/ml). consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  == carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. the first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the n-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase i, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase i. other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, e-1010, s-4661 and bms-181139. carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, dz-2640, cs-834 and gv-129606. carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. this differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. however, class b beta-lactamases, along with some rare class a and d enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. although class b enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp., bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, flavobacterium spp. and legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in b. fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and members of enterobacteriaceae such as serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. the very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.

TI  == functional control of the binuclear metal site in the metallo-beta-lactamase-like fold by subtle amino acid replacements.
AB  == at present there are three protein families that share a common structural domain, the alphabeta/betaalpha fold of class b beta-lactamases: zinc beta-lactamases, glyoxalases ii, and a-type flavoproteins. a detailed inspection  of their superimposed structures was undertaken and showed that although these proteins contain binuclear metal sites in spatially equivalent positions, there are some subtle differences within the first ligand sphere that determine a distinct composition of metals. although zinc beta-lactamases contain either a mono or a di-zinc center, the catalytically active form of glyoxalase ii contains a mixed iron-zinc binuclear center, whereas a-type flavoproteins contain a di-iron site. these variations on the type of metal site found within a common fold are correlated with the subtle variations in the nature of the ligating amino acid residues and are discussed in terms of the different reactions catalyzed by each of the protein families. correlation of these observations with sequence data results in the definition of a sequence motif that comprises the possible binuclear metal site ligands in this broad family. the evolution of the  proteins sharing this common fold and factors modulating reactivity are also discussed.

TI  == familial mutations and zinc stoichiometry determine the rate-limiting step of nitrocefin hydrolysis by metallo-beta-lactamase from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the diverse members of the metallo-beta-lactamase family are a growing clinical threat evolving under considerable selective pressure. the enzyme from bacillus cereus differs from the bacteroides fragilis enzyme in sequence, zinc stoichiometry, and mechanism. to chart the evolution of the more reactive b. fragilis enzyme, we have made changes in an active site cysteine residue as well  as in zinc content to mimic that which occurs in the b. cereus enzyme. specifically, by introducing a c104r mutation into the b. fragilis enzyme, binding of two zinc ions is maintained, but the k(cat) value for nitrocefin hydrolysis is decreased from 226 to 14 s(-)(1). removal of 1 equiv of zinc from this mutant further decreases k(cat) to 4.4 s(-)(1). in both cases, the observed  k(cat) closely approximates that found in the di- and monozinc forms of the b. cereus enzyme (12 and 6 s(-)(1), respectively). pre-steady-state stopped-flow studies using nitrocefin as a substrate indicate that these enzyme forms share a  similar mechanism featuring an anionic intermediate but that the rate-limiting step changes from protonation of that species to the c-n bond cleavage leading to the intermediate. overall, features that contribute 3.7 kcal/mol toward the acceleration of the c-n bond cleavage step have been uncovered although some of the total acceleration is masked in the steady-state by a change in rate-limiting step. these experiments illustrate one step in the evolution of a catalytic mechanism and, in a larger perspective, one step in the evolution of antibiotic resistance mechanisms.

TI  == characterization of vim-2, a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase and its plasmid- and integron-borne gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate in france.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa col-1 was identified in a blood culture of a 39-year-old-woman treated with imipenem in marseilles, france, in 1996. this strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem, but  remained susceptible to the monobactam aztreonam. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of p. aeruginosa col-1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli dh10b. the deduced 266-amino-acid protein was an ambler class b beta-lactamase, with amino acid identities of 32% with b-ii from bacillus cereus; 31% with imp-1 from several gram-negative rods in japan, including p. aeruginosa; 27% with ccra from bacteroides fragilis; 24% with blab from chryseobacterium meningosepticum; 24% with ind-1 from chryseobacterium indologenes; 21% with cpha-1 from aeromonas hydrophila; and 11% with l-1 from stenotrophomonas maltophilia. it was most closely related to vim-1 beta-lactamase recently reported from italian p. aeruginosa clinical isolates (90% amino acid identity). purified vim-2 beta-lactamase had a pi of 5.6, a relative molecular mass of 29.7 kda, and a broad substrate hydrolysis range, including penicillins,  cephalosporins, cephamycins, oxacephamycins, and carbapenems, but not monobactams. as a metallo-beta-lactamase, its activity was zinc dependent and inhibited by edta (50% inhibitory concentration, 50 microm). vim-2 conferred a resistance pattern to beta-lactams in e. coli dh10b that paralleled its in vitro  hydrolytic properties, except for susceptibility to ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and cefepime. bla(vim-2) was located on a ca. 45-kb plasmid that in  addition conferred resistance to sulfamides and that was not self-transmissible either from p. aeruginosa to e. coli or from e. coli to e. coli. bla(vim-2) was the only gene cassette located within the variable region of a novel class 1 integron, in56, that was weakly related to the bla(vim-1)-containing integron. vim-2 is the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing metalloenzyme characterized from a p.  aeruginosa isolate outside japan.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of j-111,225, a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem, against transferable imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase producers.
AB  == imp-1 beta-lactamase, a class b zinc metallo-enzyme encoded by the transferable bla(imp) gene, is known to confer high-level resistance to carbapenems as well as to penicillins and cephalosporins. j-111, 225 is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with a structurally unique side chain comprising a trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio moiety at the c2 position. it inhibited 17 serratia marcescens and two pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1-producing clinical isolates at a concentration of 32 mg/l (range 4-32 mg/l). it showed synergy with imipenem against imp-1-producing s. marcescens bb5886 and p. aeruginosa gn17203 with minimal fic indices of 0.38 and 0.5, respectively. j-111,225 was more resistant than imipenem to hydrolysis by class b metallo-beta-lactamases. in kinetic studies, j-111,225 inhibited the imp-i enzyme with a k(i) of 0.18 microm when imipenem was used as a substrate. in contrast, j-111,225 was the substrate for hydrolysis by other class b beta-lactamases such as bacteroides fragilis ccra, stenotrophomonas maltophilia l1 and bacillus cereus type ii enzyme with respective k(m) values of 11, 10 and 148 microm. the greater antibacterial activity of j-111,225 against imp-1-producing bacteria may result from its unique interaction with the beta-lactamase.

TI  == carbapenem derivatives as potential inhibitors of various beta-lactamases, including class b metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == a variety of 1beta-methylcarbapenem derivatives were screened to identify inhibitors of imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase, a class b beta-lactamase, in an automated microassay system using nitrocefin as a substrate. the structure-inhibitory-activity relationship study revealed that three types of 1beta-methylcarbapenems having benzothienylthio, dithiocarbamate, or pyrrolidinylthio moieties at the c-2 position showed good inhibitory activity. among the compounds screened, j-110,441, having a benzothienylthio moiety at the  c-2 position of 1beta-methylcarbapenem, was the most potent inhibitor of class b  metallo-beta-lactamases with k(i) values of 0. 0037, 0.23, 1.00, and 0.83 microm  for imp-1 encoded by the bla(imp) gene, ccra from bacteroides fragilis, l1 from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and type ii from bacillus cereus, respectively. in  a further characterization study, j-110,441 also showed inhibitory activity against tem-type class a serine beta-lactamase and chromosomal class c serine beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae with k(i) values of 2.54 and 0.037 microm, respectively. combining imipenem or ceftazidime with j-110,441 had a synergistic effect on the antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. against the isolates of imp-1-producing serratia marcescens, the mics of imipenem decreased to levels ranging from 1/64 to 1/4 in the presence of one-fourth of the mic of j-110,441. against e. cloacae producing high levels of class c beta-lactamase, the mic of ceftazidime decreased from 64 to 4 microg/ml in the presence of 4 microg of j-110,441 per ml. this is the first report to describe a new class of inhibitor of class b and class c beta-lactamases including transferable imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == cloning and characterization of blavim, a new integron-borne metallo-beta-lactamase gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate.
AB  == production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity was detected in a carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (isolate vr-143/97)  from an italian inpatient at the verona university hospital (northern italy). the metallo-beta-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of vr-143/97, constructed in an escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class b beta-lactamase that was named vim-1. at the sequence level vim-1 was rather divergent from the other class b enzymes (16.4 to 38.7% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass b1 including the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus (bc-ii), the bacteroides fragilis ccra, the chryseobacterium meningosepticum blab, and the cassette-encoded imp-1 enzymes. among these, vim-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to bc-ii. similarly to blaimp, blavim was also found to be carried on  a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. the blavim-containing integron  was located on the chromosome of p. aeruginosa vr-143/97, and the metallo-beta-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable to e. coli by conjugation. expression of the integron-borne blavim gene in e. coli resulted in  a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the vim-1 enzyme.

TI  == x-ray structure of the znii beta-lactamase from bacteroides fragilis in an orthorhombic crystal form.
AB  == beta-lactamases are extracellular or periplasmic bacterial enzymes which confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. on the basis of their catalytic mechanisms, they can be divided into two major groups: active-site serine enzymes (classes a, c and d) and the znii enzymes (class b). the first crystal structure  of a class b enzyme, the metallo-beta-lactamase from bacillus cereus, has been solved at 2.5 a resolution [carfi, pares, duee, galleni, duez, frere & dideberg (1995). embo j. 14, 4914-4921]. recently, the crystal structure of the metallo-beta-lactamase from bacteroides fragilis has been determined in a tetragonal space group [concha, rasmussen, bush & herzberg (1996). structure, 4,  823-836]. the structure of the metallo-beta-lactamase from b. fragilis in an orthorhombic crystal form at 2.0 a resolution is reported here. the final crystallographic r is 0.196 for all the 32501 observed reflections in the range 10-2.0 a. the refined model includes 458 residues, 437 water molecules, four zinc and two sodium ions. these structures are discussed with reference to zn binding  and activity. a catalytic mechanism is proposed which is coherent with metallo-beta-lactamases being active with either one zn ion (as in aeromonas hydrophila) or two zn ions (as in b. fragilis) bound to the protein.

TI  == spectroscopic characterization of a binuclear metal site in bacillus cereus beta-lactamase ii.
AB  == the zinc metalloenzyme beta-lactamase ii (betalii) from bacillus cereus has been  overexpressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione-s-transferase, and the metal binding properties of recombinant betalii toward zn(ii) and co(ii) have been studied by fluorescence and activity measurements. the apoenzyme is able to bind two metal ion equivalents, which confer on betalii its maximum enzymatic efficiency. the enzyme is partially active with one metal ion equivalent. the dico(ii) and a mixed zn(ii)co(ii) derivative of betalii were obtained and probed by electronic and paramagnetic nmr spectroscopy. in the high-affinity site, the metal is bound to three his residues and a solvent molecule, adopting a tetrahedral geometry. a cys, a his, and an asp residue are coordinated to the low-affinity metal site, together with two or three solvent molecules. this coordination polyhedron resembles the binuclear metal site of the bacteroides fragilis beta-lactamase [concha, n., rasmussen, b.  a., bush, k., and herzberg, o. (1996) structure 4, 823-836; carfi, a., duee, e.,  paul-soto, r., galleni, m., frere, j. m., and dideberg, o.

(1995) embo j. 14, 4914-4921]. these results suggest that this binuclear metal site may be a general feature of metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == characterization and sequence of the chryseobacterium (flavobacterium) meningosepticum carbapenemase: a new molecular class b beta-lactamase showing a broad substrate profile.
AB  == the metallo-beta-lactamase produced by chryseobacterium (formerly flavobacterium) meningosepticum, which is the flavobacterial species of greatest clinical relevance, was purified and characterized. the enzyme, named blab, contains a polypeptide with an apparent mr of 26000, and has a pi of 8.5. it hydrolyses penicillins, cephalosporins (including cefoxitin), carbapenems and 6-beta-iodopenicillanate, a mechanism-based inactivator of active-site serine beta-lactamases. the enzyme was inhibited by edta, 1-10 phenanthroline and pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, with different inactivation parameters for each chelating agent. the c. meningosepticum blab gene was cloned and sequenced. according to the g+c content and codon usage, the blab gene appeared to be endogenous to the species. the blab enzyme showed significant sequence similarity to other class b beta-lactamases, being overall more similar to members of subclass b1, which includes the metallo-enzymes of bacillus cereus (bc-ii) and bacteroides fragilis (ccra) and the imp-1 enzyme found in various microbial species, and more distantly related to the metallo-beta-lactamases of aeromonas spp. (cpha, cpha2 and imis) and of stenotrophomonas maltophilia (l1).

TI  == inhibition of metallo-beta-lactamases by a series of thiol ester derivatives of mercaptophenylacetic acid.
AB  == a series of mercaptophenylacetic acid thiol esters bearing a phenyl substituent adjacent to the carboxylic acid function has been shown to be inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases. the inhibition of the bacteroides fragilis cfia and bacillus cereus ii metallo-beta-lactamases was zn2- dependent, greater inhibition being observed at 1 microm znso4 than at 100 microm znso4. despite this zn2+ dependency, isothermal titration calorimetry studies illustrated that representative compounds had no detectable affinity for zn2+ (k > 1 mm). this indicates that their mode of inhibition was not by chelation of the active site zn2+. greatest potency was observed against the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l1 metallo-beta-lactamase with i50 values of between < 1.95 microm and 6 microm and  sb-217843 exhibited a similar level of inhibition of this enzyme at 1 and 100 microm zn2+ (i50 values 5 and 6 microm, respectively). inhibition of b. cereus ii metallo-beta-lactamase by sb-218018 and sb-217782 was competitive with ki values  of 185 microm and 1500 microm, respectively. therefore, these compounds are specific inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases and provide further probes of the  active sites of these enzymes.

TI  == inhibition of metallo-beta-lactamases by a series of mercaptoacetic acid thiol ester derivatives.
AB  == a series of mercaptoacetic acid thiol esters have been identified as metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. electrospray mass spectrometry (esms) has shown that irreversible inhibition of the bacillus cereus ii metallo-beta-lactamase by sb214751, sb214752, and sb213079 was concomitant with a 90-da increase in mass of the enzyme. tryptic digestion of the b. cereus ii inhibited with sb214751 illustrated that the peptide fragment, containing the only cysteine of the enzyme, had undergone a mass increment of 90 da. it was further demonstrated that b. cereus ii hydrolyzed this type of compound across the thiol ester bond to yield mercaptoacetic acid. mercaptoacetic acid is the only molecular fragment common to sb214751, sb214752, and sb213079, and free mercaptoacetic acid does not bind covalently to b. cereus ii. therefore, it is concluded that these compounds inhibit b. cereus ii by the mechanism-based delivery of mercaptoacetic acid, forming a disulfide linkage with the active sites cysteine (predicted mass shift = +90 da) under the aerobic conditions of the assay. the different thiol esters examined had a broad range of potencies against the metallo-beta-lactamases tested. for example sb214751, sb214752, and sb213079 all had 50% inhibitory concentrations of < 10 and > 1,000 microm for the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l-1 and bacteroides fragilis cfia enzymes, respectively. sb216968 was particularly active against the aeromonas hydrophila cpha metallo-beta-lactamase and was found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of this enzyme (ki = 3.9 microm), whereas it exhibited irreversible inhibition of the l-1 enzyme. these observations with this series of compounds have revealed subtle differences between the active sites of different metallo-beta-lactamases. finally, a novel application for isothermal titration calorimetry for assessing the zinc chelating activity of candidate inhibitors is also presented.

TI  == crystal structure of the wide-spectrum binuclear zinc beta-lactamase from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == background: the metallo-beta-lactamase from bacteroides fragilis hydrolyzes a wide range of beta-lactam antibiotics, and is not clinically susceptible to any known beta-lactamase inhibitors. b. fragilis is associated with post-surgery hospital infections, and there has been a recent report of plasmid-mediated dissemination of the enzyme. effective inhibitors are therefore urgently needed.  knowledge of the three-dimensional structure will aid in the drug design effort.  results: the crystal structure of the enzyme has been determined by using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at the zinc absorption edge and refined to  1.85 a resolution. the structure is a four-layer alpha/beta/beta/alpha molecule.  the active site, found at the edge of the beta sandwich contains a binuclear zinc center with several novel features. one zinc is tetrahedrally coordinated, the other has a trigonal bipyramidal coordination; a water/hydroxide molecule serves  as a ligand for both metals. the residues that coordinate the two zincs are invariant in all metallo-beta-lactamases that have been sequenced, except for two conservative replacements. despite the existence of the pattern for binuclear zinc binding, the reported structure of the bacillus cereus enzyme contains only  a single zinc. conclusions: structural analysis indicates that affinity for the penta-coordinated zinc can be modulated by neighboring residues, perhaps explaining the absence of the second zinc in the b. cereus structure. models of bound substrates suggest that the active-site channel can accommodate a wide variety of beta-lactams. we propose that the zinc cluster prepares an hydroxide,  probably the hydroxide that ligates both zincs, for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon atom of the beta-lactam. the resulting negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate implicated in catalysis is stabilized by an oxyanion hole formed by the side chain of the invariant asn 193 and the tetrahedral zinc.

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

TI  == molecular characterization of an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase found in  a clinical isolate of serratia marcescens that shows imipenem resistance.
AB  == a clinical isolate of serratia marcescens (tn9106) produced a metallo beta-lactamase (imp-1) which conferred resistance to imipenem and broad-spectrum  beta-lactams. the blaimp gene providing imipenem resistance was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli hb101. the imp-1 was purified from e. coli hb101 that harbors psmbnu24 carrying blaimp, and its apparent molecular mass was calculated to be about 30 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. kinetic studies of imp-1 against various beta-lactams revealed that this enzyme hydrolyzes not only various broad-spectrum beta-lactams but also carbapenems. however, aztreonam was relatively stable against imp-1. although clavulanate or cloxacillin failed to inhibit imp-1, hg2+, fe2+, or cu2+ blocked the enzyme's activity. moreover, the presence of edta in the reaction buffer resulted in a decrease in the enzyme's activity. carbapenem resistance was not transferred from s. marcescens tn9106 to e. coli csh2 by conjugation. a hybridization study confirmed that blaimp was encoded on the chromosome of s. marcescens tn9106. by nucleotide sequencing analysis, blaimp was found to encode  a protein of 246 amino acid residues and was shown to have considerable homology  to the metallo beta-lactamase genes of bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, and aeromonas hydrophila. the g+c content of blaimp was 39.4%. four consensus amino acid residues, his-95, his-97, cys-176, and his-215, which form putative zinc ligands, were conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of imp-1. by determination of the amino acid sequence at the n terminus of purified mature imp-1, 18 amino acid residues were found to be processed from the n terminus of the premature enzyme as a signal peptide. these results clearly show that imp-1 is an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase, of which the primary structure has  been completely determined, that confers resistance to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.

TI  == biochemical properties of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae and cloning of the gene into escherichia coli.
AB  == a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae, strain nor-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pi) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain e. cloacae nor-1; the higher pi corresponded to ampc cephalosporinase. plasmid dna was not detected in e. cloacae nor-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into escherichia coli jm109. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pacyc184. one recombinant plasmid, pptn1, harbored a 5.3-kb sau3a fragment from e. cloacae nor-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. this enzyme (pi 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as edta and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of zncl2. its relative molecular mass was 30,000 da. induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. subcloning experiments with hindiii partial digests of pptn1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pptn2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pptn1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb hindiii fragment from pptn2 failed to determine any homology with ampc of e. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family enterobacteriaceae (bla(tem-1)) and bla(shv-3) derivatives), and with previously  described carbapenemase genes such as those from xanthomonas maltophilia, bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis (cfia), and aeromonas hydrophila (cpha). this work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from e. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. this is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == an overview of the kinetic parameters of class b beta-lactamases.
AB  == the catalytic properties of three class b beta-lactamases (from pseudomonas maltophilia, aeromonas hydrophila and bacillus cereus) were studied and compared  with those of the bacteroides fragilis enzyme. the a. hydrophila beta-lactamase exhibited a unique specificity profile and could be considered as a rather specific 'carbapenemase'. no relationships were found between sequence similarities and catalytic properties. the problem of the repartition of class b  beta-lactamases into sub-classes is discussed. improved purification methods were devised for the p. maltophilia and a. hydrophila beta-lactamases including, for the latter enzyme, a very efficient affinity chromatography step on a zn(2+)-chelate column.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and deduced functions of a set of cotranscribed genes of streptomyces coelicolor a3(2) including the polyketide synthase for the antibiotic actinorhodin.
AB  == a 5.3-kb region of the streptomyces coelicolor actinorhodin gene cluster, including the genes for polyketide biosynthesis, was sequenced. six identified open reading frames (orf1-6) were related to genetically characterized mutations  of classes acti, vii, iv, and vb by complementation analysis. orf1-6 run divergently from the adjacent actiii gene, which encodes the polyketide synthase  (pks) ketoreductase, and appear to form an operon. the deduced gene products of orf1-3 are similar to fatty acid synthases (fas) of different organisms and pks genes from other polyketide producers. the predicted orf5 gene product is similar to type ii beta-lactamases of bacillus cereus and bacteroides fragilis. the orf6  product does not resemble other known proteins. combining the genetical, biochemical, and similarity data, the potential activities of the products of the six genes can be postulated as: 1) condensing enzyme/acyl transferase (orf1 + orf2); 2) acyl carrier protein (orf3); 3) putative cyclase/dehydrase (orf4); 4) dehydrase (orf5); and 5) "dimerase" (orf6). the data show that the actinorhodin pks consists of discrete monofunctional components, like that of the escherichia  coli (type ii) fas, rather than the multifunctional polypeptides for the macrolide pkss and vertebrate fass (type i).

TI  == the aeromonas hydrophila cpha gene: molecular heterogeneity among class b metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == an aeromonas hydrophila gene, named cpha, coding for a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase, was cloned in escherichia coli by screening an aeromonas  genomic library for clones able to grow on imipenem-containing medium. from sequencing data, the cloned cpha gene appeared able to code for a polypeptide of  254 amino acids whose sequence includes a potential n-terminal leader sequence for targeting the protein to the periplasmic space. these data were in agreement  with the molecular mass of the original aeromonas enzyme and of the recombinant enzyme produced in e. coli, evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude beta-lactamase preparations followed by renaturation treatment for proteins separated in the gel and localization of protein bands showing carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase activity by a modified iodometric technique. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cpha enzyme showed regions of partial homology with both the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus and the cfia  beta-lactamase of bacteroides fragilis. sequence homologies were more pronounced  in the regions encompassing the amino acid residues known in the enzyme of b. cereus to function as ligand-binding residues for the metal cofactor. the cpha enzyme, however, appeared to share a lower degree of similarity with the two other enzymes, which, in turn, seemed more closely related to each other. these results, therefore, suggest the existence of at least two molecular subclasses within molecular class b metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == sequencing the gene for an imipenem-cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme (cfia) from bacteroides fragilis tal2480 reveals strong similarity between cfia and bacillus  cereus beta-lactamase ii.
AB  == using a newly constructed bacteroides fragilis-escherichia coli cloning shuttle vector, pjst61, we have cloned the cefoxitin (fox)-imipenem (imp) resistance determinant from b. fragilis tal2480. fox-imp resistance in this strain results from the production of a periplasmic, zn2(+)-containing beta-lactamase which hydrolyzes carbapenems and cephamycins and whose activity is resistant to clavulanic acid but sensitive to zn2(+)-binding reagents, including edta. the pjst61 vector permits efficient library construction in e. coli and allows for the transfer of the library to b. fragilis recipients for the screening or selection of specific phenotypes. the library clone containing the fox-imp resistance gene was detected after transfer to b. fragilis tm4000 (fox-imps) selecting for foxr. one of the isolates carrying plasmid pjst241 is resistant to  fox and imp and synthesizes a periplasmic protein with substrate and inhibitor properties identical to those of strain tal2480. on the basis of deletion analysis, tn1000 insertion mutations, and dna sequencing, we have defined the 747-base cfia (fox-imp resistance) gene within the 3.6-kilobase cloned insert in  pjst241. the cfia gene contains an open reading frame that could code for a precursor protein of 249 amino acids and with a molecular mass of 27,260 daltons. a potential signal sequence has been identified at the n terminus of this protein; cleavage within this sequence would result in a protein of 231 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25,249 daltons. the cfia protein shows remarkable  similarities to the exported, zn2(+)-requiring, type ii beta-lactamase blm proteins from bacillus cereus 569/h and 5/b/6. although overall amino acid identity is only 32%, the zn ligand-binding his and cys residues are precisely conserved and the amino acids in the vicinity of these sites show strong similarities (greater than 80%) when the cfia and blm proteins are compared.

TI  == septicemia in children with cancer.
AB  == because of the persistently high mortality from sepsis in cancer patients, a retrospective study was designed to identify the causative organisms and to determine the factors affecting the outcome of sepsis. a total of 84 episodes of  septicemia in 61 children with cancer were studied. the more frequently isolated  organisms were: staphylococcus aureus (21.4%); escherichia coli (18%); klebsiella (7.1%); pseudomonas (6%); and bacteroides fragilis (6%). other isolates included  proteus, serratia, acinetobacter, hemolytic streptococcus, and bacillus cereus. in 10.7% of septic episodes, mixed bacterial infections were documented. twenty-four (28.6%) resulted in death; in 13 (54%) death occurred within 24 hours after admission. the fatality rate was high in cases associated with absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of less than 100/cu mm, in neoplastic relapse, and when infection with gram-negative, anaerobic and mixed bacterial flora occurred.

TI  == effect of some bacterial products on platelet electrophoretic mobility (pem).
AB  == bacterial lps, used in our experiments, are able to decrease pem at concentration of 100 microgram/ml after incubation with 1 x 10(7) platelets/ml for 30 min at 37 degrees c. such effect is statistically significant for bacteroides fragilis lps, s. enteritidis and s. typhi. e. coli lps 026:b6 w and e. coli 055:b5 w are not effective at all, s. minnesota (incomplete) lps 595 and 345 free of 0-polysaccharide and partially lacking core in their molecule did not influence pem, while s. minnesota lps (s form) (a complete lps) strongly decreased pem. this fact could suggest that 0-polysaccharide is involved in this inhibitory effect on pem. klebsiella enterotoxin and b. cereus enterotoxin are able to decrease pem at concentration of 100 microgram/ml, after incubation with 1 x 10(7) platelets for 30 min at 37 degrees c, while no inhibition of pem was seen when shighella enterotoxin and v. parahaemoliticus enterotoxin was used in similar way. the aa. conclude that endotoxin and enterotoxin are able to change the electrokinetic charge (negative) of platelets, thereby, causing a decrease of pem.
