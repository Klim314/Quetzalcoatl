TI  == microbiological profile resistant to different intracanal medications in primary  endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study aimed to determine the microbiological profile  resistant to different intracanal medications in primary endodontic infections by using both microbiological culture and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. methods: twenty primarily infected root canals were selected and then  instrumented before being randomly divided into 2 groups according to the intracanal medications: calcium hydroxide (ca[oh]2) or ca(oh)2 + chlorhexidine (chx). samples were collected before and after root canal procedures, which consisted in submitting them to microbiological culture and processing them for checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no differences were found between the ca(oh)2 (99.98%) and ca(oh)2 + chx groups (99.76%) regarding the median percentage values for the reduction of cultivable bacteria. the most frequently detected species were capnocytophaga ochracea (70%) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (70%) in the initial samples. after instrumentation, the most frequently detected species were e. faecium (60%). after root canal treatments using either ca(oh)2 or ca(oh)2 + chx as intracanal medications, the most frequently detected species were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (90%) and enterococcus faecium (40%), respectively. both treatments significantly decreased the number of bacterial species compared with the initial sample. however, this reduction was significantly greater in the ca(oh)2 + chx group (p < .05). this difference was also observed when evaluating the total bacterial load (p < .05).  conclusions: the use of ca(oh)2 associated with chx as an intracanal medication showed better results by acting on gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms although such an action to eradicate enterococci should also be sought.

TI  == proteomic analysis of endodontic infections by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry.
AB  == introduction: endodontic infections are very prevalent and have a polymicrobial etiology characterized by complex interrelationships between endodontic microorganisms and the host defenses. proteomic analysis of endodontic infections can provide global insights into the invasion, pathogenicity mechanisms, and multifactorial interactions existing between root canal bacteria and the host in  the initiation and progression of apical periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to apply proteomic techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) for the identification of proteins of bacterial origin present in endodontic infections. methods: endodontic specimens were aseptically  obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-lc-ms/ms followed by a database search. results: proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors,  and antibiotic-resistance proteins. conclusions: lc-ms/ms offers a sensitive analytical platform to study the disease processes in the root canal environment. the array of proteins expressed in endodontic infections reflects the complex microbial presence and highlights the bacterial species involved in the inflammatory process.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.
