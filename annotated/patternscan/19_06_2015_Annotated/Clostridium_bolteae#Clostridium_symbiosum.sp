TI  == [epidemiological study on cigar-shaped clostridia isolated in a local japanese general hospital].
AB  == cigar-shaped clostridia such as clostridium clostridioforme and clostridium symbiosum have been found in serious infections such as bacteremia. in japan, however, these strains are unrecognized as clinically significant because they are overlooked as unidentified gram-negative rods. we isolated 60 strains of cigar-shaped clostridium spp. from 48 clinical specimens treated at our laboratory from november 2004 to september 2006. of these, 19 (39.6%) were primary infections and 29 (60.4%) postsurgical. primary infections included infected decubitus ulcer (7), peritonitis, intra abdominal abscess, sepsis (2 cases in each group), pyometra, bartholin's gland abscess, and fournier's gangrene (1 case in each group). secondary infections included 28 cases of surgical site infection and 1 case of pyothorax. crp in 30 cases (62.5%) exeeded  10 mg/dl. in 26 (54.2%), wbc exceeded 12,000/microl. the 60 isolated strains were as follows by 16s rrna sequencing: clostridium hathewayi (26.7%), c. clostridioforme (16.7%), clostridium bolteae (18.3%), clostridium citroniae (10%), clostridium aldenense (8.3%), and clostridium symbiosum (20%). in antimicrobial susceptibility, strains of c. hathe-wayi showed relatively higher mic for cefotaxime (mic50; 64 microg/ml, mic90; 128 microg/ml). three strains of  c. bolteae were beta-lactamase-producing and their mics for ampicillin exceeded 128 microg/ml.

TI  == clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and clostridium citroniae sp. nov. isolated from human clinical infections.
AB  == one hundred eight isolates were previously identified in our laboratory as clostridium clostridioforme by colonial and cellular morphology, as well as biochemical tests. recent studies have indicated that there are actually three different species in this c. clostridioforme group: c. hathewayi, c. bolteae, and c. clostridioforme. our isolates were reexamined using biochemical and enzymatic  tests and molecular methods. forty-six isolates were reidentified as c. hathewayi, 34 as c. bolteae, five as c. clostridioforme, and one as c. symbiosum. twenty-two strains were identified only to the genus level by 16s rrna gene sequencing, and although they are microscopically and morphologically indistinguishable from the above-mentioned three species, they are phenotypically different and only 96 to 98% similar by gene sequencing. twenty of these 22 strains were indole positive and formed two novel species. we propose clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and clostridium citroniae sp. nov. as names for these new species. they are differentiated from each other by results for raffinose, rhamnose, alpha-galactosidase, and beta-galactosidase: positive, negative, positive, and positive, respectively, for the former species and negative, positive, negative, and negative, respectively, for the latter species. the type  strain of c. aldenense is rma 9741 (atcc baa-1318; ccug 52204), and the type strain of c. citroniae is rma 16102 (atcc baa-1317; ccug 52203).
