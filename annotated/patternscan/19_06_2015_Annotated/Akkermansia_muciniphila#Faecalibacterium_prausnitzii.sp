TI  == specific gut microbiota features and metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with obesity.
AB  == background: gut microbial gene richness and specific bacterial species are associated with metabolic risk markers in humans, but the impact of host physiology and dietary habits on the link between the gut microbiota and metabolic markers remain unclear. the objective of this study was to identify gut metagenomic markers associated with estimates of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obesity, and to explore whether the associations between metagenomic and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for body fat, age and habitual dietary intake. methods: faecal dna from 53 women with obesity was analysed through quantitative metagenomic sequencing and analysis, and a systematic search was performed for bacterial genes associated with estimates of insulin resistance, inflammation and lipid metabolism. subsequently, the correlations between metagenomic species and metabolic markers were tested by linear regression models, with and without covariate adjustment. results: one hundred and fourteen metagenomic species correlated with metabolic markers (p<0.001) including akkermansia muciniphila, bilophila wadsworthia, bifidobacterium longum and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but also species not previously associated with metabolic markers including bacteroides faecis and dorea longicatena. the majority of the identified correlations between bacterial  species and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for differences in body  fat, age and dietary macronutrient composition; however, the negative correlation with insulin resistance observed for b. longum and f. prausnitzii appeared to be  modified by the intake of dietary fibre and fat, respectively. conclusions: this  study shows that several gut bacterial species are linked to metabolic risk markers in obesity, also after adjustment for potential confounders, such as long-term diet composition. the study supports the use of gut metagenomic markers for metabolic disease prediction and warrants further investigation of causality.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == manipulating the gut microbiota to maintain health and treat disease.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota composition varies between healthy and diseased individuals for numerous diseases. although any cause or effect relationship between the alterations in the gut microbiota and disease is not always clear, targeting the intestinal microbiota might offer new possibilities for prevention and/or treatment of disease. objective: here we review some examples of manipulating the intestinal microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants. results: prebiotics are best known for their ability to increase the number of bifidobacteria. however, specific prebiotics could potentially also stimulate other species they can also stimulate other species associated with health, like akkermansia muciniphila, ruminococcus bromii, the roseburia/enterococcus rectale group, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. probiotics have beneficial health effects for different diseases and digestive symptoms. these effects can be due to the direct effect of the probiotic bacterium or its products itself, as well as effects of the probiotic on the resident microbiota. probiotics can influence the microbiota composition as well  as the activity of the resident microbiota. fecal microbial transplants are a drastic intervention in the gut microbiota, aiming for total replacement of one microbiota by another. with numerous successful studies related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection, the potential of fecal microbial transplants to treat other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic and cardiovascular disorders is  under investigation. conclusions: improved knowledge on the specific role of gut  microbiota in prevention and treatment of disease will help more targeted manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. further studies are necessary to see the (long term) effects for health of these interventions.

TI  == impact of the gut microbiota on rodent models of human disease.
AB  == traditionally bacteria have been considered as either pathogens, commensals or symbionts. the mammal gut harbors 10(14) organisms dispersed on approximately 1000 different species. today, diagnostics, in contrast to previous cultivation techniques, allow the identification of close to 100% of bacterial species. this  has revealed that a range of animal models within different research areas, such  as diabetes, obesity, cancer, allergy, behavior and colitis, are affected by their gut microbiota. correlation studies may for some diseases show correlation  between gut microbiota composition and disease parameters higher than 70%. some disease phenotypes may be transferred when recolonizing germ free mice. the mechanistic aspects are not clear, but some examples on how gut bacteria stimulate receptors, metabolism, and immune responses are discussed. a more deeper understanding of the impact of microbiota has its origin in the overall composition of the microbiota and in some newly recognized species, such as akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which seem to have an impact on more or less severe disease in specific models. thus, the impact of the microbiota on animal models is of a magnitude that cannot be ignored in future research. therefore, either models with specific microbiota must be developed, or the microbiota must be characterized in individual studies and incorporated into data evaluation.

TI  == understanding how commensal obligate anaerobic bacteria regulate immune functions in the large intestine.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract is colonised by trillions of commensal bacteria, most of which are obligate anaerobes residing in the large intestine. appropriate bacterial colonisation is generally known to be critical for human health. in particular, the development and function of the immune system depends on microbial colonisation, and a regulated cross-talk between commensal bacteria, intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells is required to maintain mucosal immune homeostasis. this homeostasis is disturbed in various inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. several in vitro and in vivo studies indicate a role for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides fragilis, akkermansia muciniphila and segmented filamentous bacteria in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. these obligate anaerobes are abundant in the healthy intestine but reduced in several inflammatory diseases, suggesting an association with protective effects on human health. however, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the effects of obligate anaerobic intestinal bacteria remains limited, in part due to the difficulty of co-culturing obligate anaerobes together with oxygen-requiring human epithelial cells. by using novel dual-environment co-culture models, it will be possible to  investigate the effects of the unstudied majority of intestinal microorganisms on the human epithelia. this knowledge will provide opportunities for improving human health and reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases.

TI  == altered microbiota associated with abnormal humoral immune responses to commensal organisms in enthesitis-related arthritis.
AB  == introduction: prior studies have established altered microbiota and immunologic reactivity to enteric commensal organisms in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). since intestinal inflammation is present in a subset of patients with both pediatric and adult spondyloarthritis (spa), we hypothesized that spa patients may also have altered microbiota and immune responsiveness to enteric organisms.  methods: stool and blood specimens were collected from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (era) and non-inflammatory controls. dna purified from stool was subject to pcr amplification and sequencing of the variable iv region from the 16s rdna gene. iga and igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were performed on select species of bacteria in most subjects. results:  twenty-five children with era and 13 controls were included. the era patients had less faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.8% versus 10%, p = 0.008) and lachnospiraceae family (12 versus 7.0%, p = 0.020), a statistically significant increase in bifidobacterium (1.8% versus 0%, p = 0.032) and a non-statistically significant increase in bacteroides (21% versus 11%, p = 0.150). akkermansia muciniphila was abundant (>2%) in 7/27 era patients but none of the controls (p = 0.072.) cluster analysis revealed two clusters of era patients: cluster one (n =  8) was characterized by high levels of bacteroides genus, while a second (n = 15) cluster had similar levels as the controls. seven of 17 (41%) of the era subjects in cluster 2 compared to 0/8 of the subjects in cluster 1 had abundant akkermansia muciniphila (p = 0.057). serum iga and igg antibody levels against f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis were similar between patients and controls, whereas the two groups showed divergent responses when the fecal relative abundances of f. prausnitzii and bacteroides were compared individually against iga antibody levels recognizing f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: the  abundance of f. prausnitzii in the stool among patients with era is reduced compared to controls, and bacteroides and a. muciniphila are identified as associative agents in subsets of era patients. differences in the humoral responses to these bacteria may contribute to disease.

TI  == differential modulation by akkermansia muciniphila and faecalibacterium prausnitzii of host peripheral lipid metabolism and histone acetylation in mouse  gut organoids.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for numerous aspects of human health. however, the underlying mechanisms of many host-microbiota interactions remain unclear. the aim of this study was to characterize effects of the microbiota on host epithelium using a novel ex vivo model based on mouse ileal organoids. we have explored the transcriptional response of organoids upon exposure to short-chain fatty acids (scfas) and products generated by two abundant microbiota constituents, akkermansia muciniphila and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. we observed that a. muciniphila metabolites affect various transcription factors and genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism and growth, supporting previous in vivo findings. contrastingly, f. prausnitzii products exerted only weak effects on host transcription. additionally, a. muciniphila and its metabolite propionate modulated expression of fiaf, gpr43, histone deacetylases (hdacs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppargamma), important regulators of transcription factor regulation, cell cycle control, lipolysis, and satiety. this work illustrates that specific bacteria and their metabolites differentially modulate epithelial transcription in mouse organoids. we demonstrate that intestinal organoids provide a novel and powerful ex vivo model for host-microbiome interaction studies. importance: we investigated the influence of the gut microbiota and microbially produced short-chain fatty acids (scfas) on gut functioning. many commensal bacteria in the gut produce scfas, particularly butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders. organoids-small crypt-villus structures grown from ileal intestinal stem cells-were exposed to scfas and two specific gut bacteria. akkermansia muciniphila, found in the intestinal mucus, was recently shown to have a favorable effect on the disrupted metabolism associated with obesity. faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a commensal gut bacterium, the absence of which may be associated with crohn's disease. we showed that in our model, a.  muciniphila induces stronger effects on the host than f. prausnitzii. we observed that a. muciniphila and propionate affect the expression of genes involved in host lipid metabolism and epigenetic activation or silencing of gene expression.  we demonstrated that organoids provide a powerful tool for host-microbe interaction studies.

TI  == exploring the influence of the gut microbiota and probiotics on health: a symposium report.
AB  == the present report describes the presentations delivered at the 7th international yakult symposium, 'the intestinal microbiota and probiotics: exploiting their influence on health', in london on 22-23 april 2013. the following two themes associated with health risks were covered: (1) the impact of age and diet on the  gut microbiota and (2) the gut microbiota's interaction with the host. the strong influence of the maternal gut microbiota on neonatal colonisation was reported, as well as rapid changes in the gut microbiome of older people who move from community living to residential care. the effects of dietary changes on gut metabolism were described and the potential influence of inter-individual microbiota differences was noted, in particular the presence/absence of keystone  species involved in butyrate metabolism. several speakers highlighted the association between certain metabolic disorders and imbalanced or less diverse microbiota. data from metagenomic analyses and novel techniques (including an ex  vivo human mucosa model) provided new insights into the microbiota's influence on coeliac, obesity-related and inflammatory diseases, as well as the potential of probiotics. akkermansia muciniphila and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were suggested as targets for intervention. host-microbiota interactions were explored in the context of gut barrier function, pathogenic bacteria recognition, and the  ability of the immune system to induce either tolerogenic or inflammatory responses. there was speculation that the gut microbiota should be considered a separate organ, and whether analysis of an individual's microbiota could be useful in identifying their disease risk and/or therapy; however, more research is needed into specific diseases, different population groups and microbial interventions including probiotics.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis: novel mechanisms by which gut microbes trigger and prevent  disease.
AB  == new research has identified specific intestinal colonizing microbes that can have significant influence on health and disease. evidence is reviewed supporting an association between fusobacterium nucleatum and colon cancer and for a protective role of faecalibacterium prausnitzii in inflammatory bowel disease, of escherichia coli nissle 1917 in acute intestinal inflammation, of bifidobacterium infantis in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, and of akkermansia muciniphila in obesity and diabetes. these novel bacteria are clinically relevant and present opportunities for more focused diagnosis of colon cancer and prevention of common diseases.

TI  == microbiota and diabetes: an evolving relationship.
AB  == the gut microbiota affects numerous biological functions throughout the body and  its characterisation has become a major research area in biomedicine. recent studies have suggested that gut bacteria play a fundamental role in diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. data are accumulating in animal  models and humans suggesting that obesity and type 2 diabetes (t2d) are associated with a profound dysbiosis. first human metagenome-wide association studies demonstrated highly significant correlations of specific intestinal bacteria, certain bacterial genes and respective metabolic pathways with t2d. importantly, especially butyrate-producing bacteria such as roseburia intestinalis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii concentrations were lower in t2d subjects. this supports the increasing evidence, that butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids are able to exert profound immunometabolic effects. endotoxaemia, most likely gut-derived has also been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome and t2d and might play a key role in metabolic inflammation. a further hint towards an association between microbiota and t2d has been derived from studies in pregnancy showing that major gut microbial shifts occurring during pregnancy affect host metabolism. interestingly, certain antidiabetic drugs such as metformin also interfere with the intestinal microbiota. specific members of the microbiota such as akkermansia muciniphila might be decreased in diabetes and when administered to murines exerted antidiabetic effects. therefore, as a 'gut signature' becomes more evident in t2d, a better understanding of the role of the microbiota in diabetes might provide new aspects regarding its pathophysiological relevance and pave the way for new therapeutic principles.

TI  == future for probiotic science in functional food and dietary supplement development.
AB  == purpose of review: the purpose of this study is to provide an update of probiotic science evolving from classical approaches to the development of next-generation  probiotics, parallel to advances in the understanding of the complexity of the gut microbiome and its role in human health. recent findings: the probiotic concept is based on the notion that the gut ecosystem contributes to human physiology and, consequently, its modulation may help to maintain health and reduce disease risk. the understanding of the complexity of the gut microbiota and the specific components associated with progression from health to disease is rapidly increasing, thanks to the use of high-throughput and next-generation sequencing techniques in progressively better controlled epidemiological studies. evidence on microbiome-mediated effects by intervention with classical probiotics on humans is, however, limited. the new information is helping to set a rationale for selection of a next generation of probiotics. candidates include clostridia clusters iv, xiva and xviii, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, akkermansia muciniphila and bacteroides uniformis, the effects of which have been evaluated in preclinical trials with promising results for inflammatory and diet-related disorders. yet, the extent to which new probiotic formulations consisting of nonconventional indigenous gut bacteria will be effective on humans at a population level or in personalized nutrition strategies remains to be explored.  summary: understanding the role that indigenous intestinal bacteria and their ecological interactions play in human health and disease based on epidemiological, intervention and mechanistic studies will provide a robust rationale for selection of probiotic strains and facilitate the optimization of integrated dietary strategies to efficiently modulate the human gut microbiome, leading to improvements in nutrition and clinical practice.

TI  == human gut microbiota changes reveal the progression of glucose intolerance.
AB  == to explore the relationship of gut microbiota with the development of type 2 diabetes (t2dm), we analyzed 121 subjects who were divided into 3 groups based on their glucose intolerance status: normal glucose tolerance (ngt; n = 44), prediabetes (pre-dm; n = 64), or newly diagnosed t2dm (n = 13). gut microbiota characterizations were determined with 16s rdna-based high-throughput sequencing. t2dm-related dysbiosis was observed, including the separation of microbial communities and a change of alpha diversity between the different glucose intolerance statuses. to assess the correlation between metabolic parameters and  microbiota diversity, clinical characteristics were also measured and a significant association between metabolic parameters (fpg, crp) and gut microbiota was found. in addition, a total of 28 operational taxonomic units (otus) were found to be related to t2dm status by the kruskal-wallis h test, most of which were enriched in the t2dm group. butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g. akkermansia muciniphila atccbaa-835, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii l2-6) had a higher abundance in the ngt group than in the pre-dm group. at genus level, the abundance of bacteroides in the t2dm group was only half that of the ngt and pre-dm groups. previously reported t2dm-related markers were also compared with the data in this study, and some inconsistencies were noted. we found that verrucomicrobiae may be a potential marker of t2dm as it had a significantly lower abundance in both the pre-dm and t2dm groups. in conclusion, this research  provides further evidence of the structural modulation of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

TI  == comparison of bacterial quantities in left and right colon biopsies and faeces.
AB  == aim: to compare quantities of predominant and pathogenic bacteria in mucosal and  faecal samples. methods: twenty patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy with endoscopically and histologically normal mucosa were recruited to the study, 14 subjects of which also supplied faecal (f) samples between 15 d to 105 d post colonoscopy. mucosal biopsies were taken from each subject from the midportion of the ascending colon (right side samples, rm) and the sigmoid (left side samples,  lm). predominant intestinal and mucosal bacteria including clostridial 16s rrna gene clusters iv and xivab, bacteroidetes, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium spp., akkermansia muciniphila (a. muciniphila), veillonella spp., collinsella spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) and putative pathogens such as escherichia coli (e. coli), clostridium difficile (c. difficile), helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). host dna was quantified from the mucosal samples with human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene targeting qpcr. paired t tests and the pearson correlation were applied for statistical analysis. results: the most prominent bacterial groups were clostridial groups iv and xiva+b and bacteroidetes and bacterial species f. prausnitzii in both sample types. h. pylori and s. aureus were not detected and c. difficile was detected in only one mucosal sample and three faecal samples. e. coli was detected in less than half of the mucosal samples at both sites, but was present in all faecal samples. all detected bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae,  were present at higher levels in the faeces than in the mucosa, but the different locations in the colon presented comparable quantities (rm, lm and f followed by  p(1) for rm vs f, p(2) for lm vs f and p(3) for rm vs lm: 4.17 +/- 0.60 log(10)/g, 4.16 +/- 0.56 log(10)/g, 5.88 +/- 1.92 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.011, p(2) = 0.0069, p(3) = 0.9778 for a. muciniphila; 6.25 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 6.09 +/- 0.81 log(10)/g, 8.84 +/- 1.38 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0002, p(3) = 0.6893 for bacteroidetes; 5.27 +/- 1.68 log(10)/g, 5.38 +/- 2.06 log(10)/g, 8.20 +/- 1.14 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.7535 for bifidobacterium spp.; 6.44 +/- 1.15 log(10)/g, 6.07 +/-1.45 log(10)/g, 9.74 +/-1.13 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.637 for clostridium cluster iv; 6.65 +/- 1.23 log(10)/g, 6.57 +/- 1.52 log(10)/g, 9.13 +/- 0.96 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001,  p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.9317 for clostridium cluster xiva; 4.57 +/- 1.44 log(10)/g, 4.63 +/- 1.34 log(10)/g, 7.05 +/- 2.48 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.012, p(2) = 0.0357, p(3) = 0.7973 for collinsella spp.; 7.66 +/- 1.50 log(10)/g, 7.60 +/- 1.05 log(10)/g, 10.02 +/- 2.02 log(10)/g, p(1) </= 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0013, p(3) =  0.9919 for f. prausnitzsii; 6.17 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 5.85 +/- 0.93 log(10)/g, 7.25 +/- 1.01 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.0243, p(2) = 0.0319, p(3) = 0.6982 for veillonella spp.; 4.68 +/- 1.21 log(10)/g, 4.71 +/- 0.83 log(10)/g, 5.70 +/- 2.00 log(10)/g,  p(1) = 0.1927, p(2) = 0.0605, p(3) = 0.6476 for enterobacteriaceae). the bifidobacterium spp. counts correlated significantly between mucosal sites and mucosal and faecal samples (pearson correlation coefficients 0.62, p = 0.040 and  0.81, p = 0.005 between the right mucosal sample and faeces and the left mucosal  sample and faeces, respectively). conclusion: non-invasive faecal samples do not  reflect bacterial counts on the mucosa at the individual level, except for bifidobacteria often analysed in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == unbalance of intestinal microbiota in atopic children.
AB  == background: playing a strategic role in the host immune function, the intestinal  microbiota has been recently hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of atopy. in order to investigate the gastrointestinal microbial ecology of atopic disease, here we performed a pilot comparative molecular analysis of the faecal microbiota in atopic children and healthy controls. results: nineteen atopic children and 12 healthy controls aged 4-14 years were enrolled. stools were collected and the faecal microbiota was characterized by means of the already developed phylogenetic microarray platform, htf-microbi.array, and quantitative pcr. the intestinal microbiota of atopic children showed a significant depletion  in members of the clostridium cluster iv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, akkermansia muciniphila and a corresponding increase of the relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae. conclusion: depleted in key immunomodulatory symbionts, the atopy-associated microbiota can represent an inflammogenic microbial consortium which can contribute to the severity of the disease. our data open the way to the therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal microbiota in the treatment of atopy by means of pharmaceutical probiotics.

TI  == acute appendicitis is characterised by local invasion with fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is a local intestinal inflammation with unclear origin. the aim was to test whether bacteria in appendicitis differ in composition to bacteria found in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. methods and patients: we investigated sections of 70 appendices using rrna-based fluorescence in situ hybridisation. four hundred caecal biopsies and 400 faecal samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions were used as controls. a set of 73 group-specific bacterial probes was applied for the study. results: the mucosal surface in catarrhal appendicitis showed characteristic lesions of single epithelial cells filled with a mixed bacterial population ('pinned cells') without ulceration of the surroundings. bacteria deeply infiltrated the tissue in suppurative appendicitis. fusobacteria  (mainly fusobacterium nucleatum and necrophorum) were a specific component of these epithelial and submucosal infiltrates in 62% of patients with proven appendicitis. the presence of fusobacteria in mucosal lesions correlated positively with the severity of the appendicitis and was completely absent in caecal biopsies from healthy and disease controls. main faecal microbiota represented by bacteroides, eubacterium rectale (clostridium group xiva), faecalibacterium prausnitzii groups and akkermansia muciniphila were inversely related to the severity of the disease. the occurrence of other bacterial groups  within mucosal lesions of acute appendicitis was not related to the severity of the appendicitis. no fusobacteria were found in rectal swabs of patients with acute appendicitis. conclusions: local infection with fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum is responsible for the majority of cases of acute appendicitis.
