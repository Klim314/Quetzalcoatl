TI  - Evaluation of bacterial recovery and viability from three different swab transport systems.
AB  - This study evaluated three types of swab transport systems for organism recovery. Swabs with transport media were further assessed for organism viability over 24 hours over a range of different storage temperatures. Test organisms consisted of aerobes, fastidious aerobes and anaerobes. Swabs were tested according to the standardised quantitative elution method published by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; M-40A). There were substantial differences in primary organism recovery, with recovery rates from different swabs ranging from <0.1% to 78% for Streptococcus pyogenes. Similar differences were noted for other test organisms. In general, the flocked swab (ESwab) demonstrated highest rates of recovery for aerobic organisms, while higher rates of recovery of Fusobacterium nucleatum were demonstrated from a standard swab (Transwab). When considering organism viability, no single swab fulfilled all the criteria stipulated by the M-40A standard for all organism/temperature combinations. Organism viability was marginally better for the gel-based swab transport systems as compared to the liquid-media based ESwab. Significant differences between swab transport systems were demonstrated, including differences for primary organism recovery and viability. The ESwab showed the best recovery of organisms, while gel-based media demonstrated marginally better bacterial viability for most tested retention times and temperatures.
TI  - Oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of LL-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Some agents, including Escherichia coli and group A Streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. LL-37 is a human host defence peptide shown previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. However, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of LL-37 remains obscure. In order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on LL-37's activity against E. coli and S. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. Using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. Anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. Both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates as indicated by the growth curves generated. The sensitivities of E. coli and S. pyogenes to LL-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. The oxygen facultative E. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to LL-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. The microaerophilic pathogen S. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to LL-37 under oxygen deprivation. Our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess: treatment with immediate tonsillectomy - 10 years of experience.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Immediate tonsillectomy in patients with peritonsillar abscess is a safe and effective treatment that should be considered as an alternative to conventional incision and drainage. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and microbiology of immediate tonsillectomy over 10 years, in patients with peritonsillar abscess. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. We reviewed the clinical charts of patients diagnosed with peritonsillar abscess in Clinica Las Condes from September 2000 to August 2010, who were treated with immediate unilateral or bilateral tonsillectomy. The patients' epidemiological information, antibiotic therapy, laterality of the surgery, results of microbiological cultures, complications, and recurrences were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were studied, with a mean age of 24 years. There were no events of sepsis, and there were only four cases (3.6%) of postoperative bleeding, two of which resolved spontaneously. Only 29% of the patients required morphine pump-based analgesia in the postoperative period. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.4 days. Among the 28 unilateral tonsillectomies, 4 (14.2%) developed streptococcal tonsillitis and 2 (7.1%) were readmitted with a contralateral peritonsillitis: one cellulitis and one abscess that required drainage and tonsillectomy. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci) and anaerobic bacteria (mainly Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum).
TI  - Spontaneously draining acute otitis media in children: an observational study of  clinical findings, microbiology and clinical course.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the outcome of acute otitis media (AOM) with otorrhoea in children managed initially without antibiotics, in relation to bacterial and clinical findings, and to identify those who may benefit from antibiotics. METHODS: Otherwise healthy, not otitis prone children aged 2-16 y, presenting with AOM with spontaneous otorrhoea, were recruited from primary care and followed at selected ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinics. Specimens for bacterial investigations were obtained; symptoms were registered on a daily basis. The main outcomes measured were the frequency of children treated with antibiotics due to persisting AOM within 9 days in relation to clinical and bacteriological findings, and new AOM within 3 months. RESULTS: Twelve of 71 children who completed the trial received antibiotics during the first 9 days due to lack of improvement. One received antibiotics after 16 days due to relapsing AOM and 6 received antibiotics after 30 days due to new AOM. At 2-4 days following inclusion, over 70% of children showed normalized eardrum status and markedly reduced secretion. Alloiococcus otitidis was found in 23 samples, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12, Streptococcus pyogenes in 6, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in 5. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Fusobacterium necrophorum were not detected. Antibiotics were prescribed more extensively to children with a pulsating eardrum and abundant purulent secretion. All children with S. pyogenes received antibiotics, whereas children with only A. otitidis did not. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that antibiotics are indicated in AOM with otorrhoea and the presence of abundant purulent secretion, a pulsating eardrum, or the presence of S. pyogenes. The presence of only A. otitidis was not associated with a more prolonged course or the need for antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in tonsillitis.
AB  - This review summarizes the information that supports the potential importance of  anaerobic bacteria in tonsillitis. Some anaerobic bacteria possess interfering capability with Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) and other pathogens. The possible role of anaerobes in the acute inflammatory process in the tonsils is supported by several observations: anaerobes have been isolated from the cores of tonsils of patients with recurrent GABHS and non-GABHS tonsillitis (NST); the recovery of anaerobes as predominant pathogens in abscesses of tonsils, in many cases without any aerobic bacteria; their recovery as pathogens in well-established anaerobic infections of the tonsils (Vincent's angina); the increased recovery rate of encapsulated pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in acutely inflamed tonsils; their isolation from the cores of recurrently inflamed NST; and the response to antibiotics in patients with NST. Furthermore, immune response against Prevotella intermedia is present in patients with recurrent NST, and an immune response can also be detected against P. intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum in patients who recovered from peritonsillar cellulitis or abscesses, infectious mononucleosis and acute non-streptococcal and GABHS tonsillitis. Although more studies are needed, these findings support the possible pathogenicity of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli in tonsillitis.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - Innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  - The innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  The human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hBD-2 and hBD-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. Previous studies showed that hBD-2 was induced by Fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the NF-kappaB transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. The goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hBD-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of NF-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Different bacteria induced different levels of hBD-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal- and pathogen-stimulated cells. hBD-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the JNK and p38 pathways. However, in addition, hBD-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappaB. The results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hBD-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Tales of the unexpected.

TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  - Aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. A total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. Of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). Aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases and together with anaerobes in 87. The most common aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), Streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). Anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. Fusobacterium necrophorum and Prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, Prevotella intermedia from 32%, Peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, Fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and Actinomyces odontolyticus from 23%. The rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with S. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with F. necrophorum (P < .01). Recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with F. necrophorum than among those infected with S. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; P < .0001) or with S. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; P < .05). beta-Lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of Prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients studied harbored one or more such strains.
TI  - Enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - Necrobacillosis is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. Their possible role was studied in experiments made with a virulent FN strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously) were given. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with FN suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. Undiluted culture of a strain of Escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of FN to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered E. coli. A heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of E. coli culture had little if any effect on FN. Citrobacter freundii and comparatively small numbers of Corynebacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of E. coli. An alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of FN, though less strikingly than E. coli. FN increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and B. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
