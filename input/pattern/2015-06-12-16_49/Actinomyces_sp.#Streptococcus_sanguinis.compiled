TI  - A study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Prevotella intermedia, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. METHODS: The bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar and BHI blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. Bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. RESULTS: The optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. There was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence intensity and bacterial concentration. The mean optical density (MOD) of S. mutans and L. acidophilus cultivated in BHI blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, P < 0.05). The MOD of S. sanguis, A. viscosus, and P. intermedia cultivated in BHI blood agar was higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (37 +/- 12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, P > 0.05); the opposite was observed for C. albicans. CONCLUSION: At 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic bacteria. The fluorescence energy, Q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. Exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. METHODS In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. Furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against S. mutans was performed. RESULTS: The results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various oral bacteria and fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . mL(-1) to 125 mug . mL(-1), and the MIC of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . mL(-1) to 1,000 mug . mL(-1). Among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic S. mutans. Results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of S. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed S. mutans after 30 min. No viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: This study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing S. mutans within dental plaque.
TI  - S-aryl-L-cysteine sulphoxides and related organosulphur compounds alter oral biofilm development and AI-2-based cell-cell communication.
AB  - AIMS: To design and synthesize a library of structurally related, small molecules related to homologues of compounds produced by the plant Petiveria alliacea and determine their ability to interfere with AI-2 cell-cell communication and biofilm formation by oral bacteria. Many human diseases are associated with persistent bacterial biofilms. Oral biofilms (dental plaque) are problematic as they are often associated with tooth decay, periodontal disease and systemic disorders such as heart disease and diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a microplate-based approach, a bio-inspired small molecule library was screened for anti-biofilm activity against the oral species Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus sanguis 10556 and Actinomyces oris MG1. To complement the static screen, a flow-based BioFlux microfluidic system screen was also performed under conditions representative of the human oral cavity. Several compounds were found to display biofilm inhibitory activity in all three of the oral bacteria tested. These compounds were also shown to inhibit bioluminescence by Vibrio harveyi and were thus inferred to be quorum sensing (QS) inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Due to the structural similarity of these compounds to each other, and to key molecules in AI-2 biosynthetic pathways, we propose that these molecules potentially reduce biofilm formation via antagonism of QS or QS-related pathways. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study highlights the potential for a non-antimicrobial-based strategy, focused on AI-2 cell-cell signalling, to control the development of dental plaque. Considering that many bacterial species use AI-2 cell-cell signalling, as well as the increased concern of the use of antimicrobials in healthcare products, such an anti-biofilm approach could also be used to control biofilms in environments beyond the human oral cavity.
TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - Salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (CD) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [T-CD]). The same number of healthy children (HC) was used as controls. The salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. Metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the T-CD children. As shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest Shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in HC. Pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for HC. Levels of Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, and Streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the T-CD children. Streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in T-CD children. The saliva of T-CD children showed the largest amount of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of Actinobacteria. T-CD children were also characterized by decreased levels of some Actinomyces species, Atopobium species, and Corynebacterium durum. Rothia mucilaginosa was the only Actinobacteria species found at the highest level in T-CD children. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated T-CD children. Some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with T-CD children. Correlations (false discovery rate [FDR], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings of this study indicated that CD is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.
TI  - Systematic screening of plant extracts from the Brazilian Pantanal with antimicrobial activity against bacteria with cariogenic relevance.
AB  - This study proposes a bioprospection methodology regarding the antimicrobial potential of plant extracts against bacteria with cariogenic relevance. Sixty extracts were obtained from ten plants--(1) Jatropha weddelliana, (2) Attalea phalerata, (3) Buchenavia tomentosa, (4) Croton doctoris, (5) Mouriri elliptica, (6) Mascagnia benthamiana, (7) Senna aculeata, (8) Unonopsis guatterioides, (9) Allagoptera leucocalyx and (10) Bactris glaucescens--using different extraction methods - (A) 70 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C, (B) water 5 min/100 degrees C, (C) water 1 h/55 degrees C, (D) water 72 h/25 degrees C, (E) hexane 72 h/25 degrees C and (F) 90 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C. The plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 50 mg/ml using the agar well diffusion test against Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 19039, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35688, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 33478 and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811. The active extracts were tested to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), cytotoxicity and chemical characterization. Forty-seven extracts (78%) were active against at least one microorganism. Extract 4A demonstrated the lowest MIC and MBC for all microorganisms except S. gordonii and the extract at MIC concentration was non-cytotoxic. The concentrated extracts were slightly cytotoxic. Electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the extract constituents coincided with the mass of the terpenoids and phenolics. Overall, the best results were obtained for extraction methods A, B and C. The present work proved the antimicrobial activity of several plants. Particularly, extracts from C. doctoris were the most active against bacteria involved in dental caries disease.
TI  - An assessment of the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning of Essix orthodontic retainer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning on the removal of microorganisms from Essix orthodontic retainers. DESIGN: In vitro laboratory study. SETTING: Department of Orthodontics and Microbiology, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London, UK. METHODS: Study 1: 120 Essix retainers were divided into four cleaning groups. The effectiveness of each cleaning method to remove a single species biofilm of Streptococcus mutans from the retainer was assessed. Study 2: 140 Essix retainers were divided into four study groups (brushing with fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine gel, immersion in chlorhexidine solution only and a control) to investigate the chemical and mechanical cleaning of the multispecies biolfilm of (Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans). RELEVANT RESULTS: In study 1, brushing with toothpaste resulted in 99% reduction of Streptococcus mutans. In study 2, all three cleaning methods recorded similarly statistically significant reductions in colony forming units per millilitre compared to the control. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the cleaning groups for any of the microorganisms except MRSA-16. For MRSA-16, chlorhexidine mouthwash and gel were significantly more potent in eliminating the microorganism than the fluoride toothpaste. CONCLUSIONS: All three cleaning methods effectively removed 99% of microorganisms from the Essix retainers. Brushing with fluoride toothpaste can therefore be confirmed as an effective method for cleaning retainers in most circumstances. The use of chlorhexidine gel or mouthwash is recommended in patients where bacterial infection has to be avoided due to immunosuppression or other reasons.
TI  - Genetic basis of coaggregation receptor polysaccharide biosynthesis in Streptococcus sanguinis and related species.
AB  - Interbacterial adhesion between streptococci and actinomyces promotes early dental plaque biofilm development. Recognition of coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (RPS) on strains of Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis by Actinomyces spp. type 2 fimbriae is the principal mechanism of these interactions. Previous studies of genetic loci for synthesis of RPS (rps) and RPS precursors (rml, galE1 and galE2) in S. gordonii 38 and S. oralis 34 revealed differences between these strains. To determine whether these differences are strain-specific or species-specific, we identified and compared loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis in additional strains of these species and in several strains of the previously unstudied species, S. sanguinis. Genes for synthesis of RPS precursors distinguished the rps loci of different streptococci. Hence, rml genes for synthesis of TDP-L-Rha were in rps loci of S. oralis strains but at other loci in S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. Genes for two distinct galactose epimerases were also distributed differently. Hence, galE1 for epimerization of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal was in galactose operons of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis strains but surprisingly, this gene was not present in S. oralis. Moreover, galE2 for epimerization of both UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc was at a different locus in each species, including rps operons of S. sanguinis. The findings provide insight into cell surface properties that distinguish different RPS-producing streptococci and open an approach for identifying these bacteria based on the arrangement of genes for synthesis of polysaccharide precursors.
TI  - Smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. Cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. This study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (IL)-1ss, IL-10, prostaglandin E2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum IgG antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus sanguis, Prevotella loescheii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga ochracea). RESULTS: The patients were stratified into health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. Of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only IL-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. As might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. IL-1ss and antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and T. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. Smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.
TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - A high-sensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for evaluating bacterial adhesion to denture materials.
AB  - Oral bacteria adhered to dental material surfaces are known to cause various oral diseases. This study aimed to develop a highsensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for quantification of oral bacteria (Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Veillonella) adhered to denture material surfaces. The amount of adhered bacteria was estimated from the fluorescence intensity derived from resazurin, which is reduced by bacterial metabolic reactions. The addition of bacterial metabolic substrates (glucose for Streptococcus and Actinomyces and sodium lactate for Veillonella) to the reaction mixture increased the fluorescence intensity by 2.3-110 times, subsequently improved the sensitivity. Furthermore, an experimental device having silicon wells containing test material was carefully designed for accurate quantification of bacteria adhered to test materials. The improved resazurin method using a new experimental device successfully enabled the quantification of bacterial adhesion to polymethyl methacrylate and other three conventional denture materials.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of bacterial and mycotic seal in implant systems with  different implant-abutment interfaces and closing torque values.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible leakage of 3 species of bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Actinomyces odontolyticus) and of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata in osseointegrated implants with different implant-abutment interface (IAI) geometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of implants, (1) implant-abutment unit with a tube-in-tube interface and (2) implant-abutment unit with a flat-to-flat interface closed with different torque values, were compared in the study. In the first phase, the implants were assembled and cultured in vitro for 7 days. The implants and abutments were disconnected and samples were taken and cultured. In the second phase, the internal part of each implant was inoculated with 0.1 microL of microbial broth and then connected to the respective abutments. Afterward, medium samples were taken and cultured. RESULTS: The group 1 implants were more resistant to colonization than those of group 2 (P < 0.05). The intragroup difference was significant between the implant-abutment units assembled with the recommended torque values and those with lower torque values (P < 0.01) for both the groups. CONCLUSION: IAI geometry influences both bacterial and yeast colonization inside the implants as well as the torque value used to connect abutments to implants.
TI  - Endodontic bacteria from primary and persistent endodontic lesions in Chinese patients as identified by cloning and 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few literatures pertain to the 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) analysis  of bacteria contributing to primary and persistent endodontic lesions, with no information available for the Chinese population. As such, we investigated endodontic bacteria associated with primary and persistent endodontic lesions in adult Chinese patients living in Beijing, China using 16S rDNA gene sequencing techniques. METHODS: Endodontic microbial samples were obtained from fourteen adult Chinese patients and subjected to DNA extraction. Pllymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were cloned and 100 clones from each generated library were randomly selected. Purified plasmid DNA with 16S rDNA gene inserts was sequenced, and the sequences were searched against GenBank databases using the BLASTN algorithm. Only significant identification with the highest-scored BLAST result and 99% minimum similarity was considered for phylotyping. RESULTS: More than 150 taxa were obtained. Primary endodontic infection was mainly associated with Burkholderia cepacia, Actinomyces, Aranicola spp. and Streptococcus sanguinis, whilst Burkholderia cepacia was predominant in the persistent endodontic infections. CONCLUSION: There is a difference in the species profile associated with endodontic infections of Chinese patients living in Beijing in comparison to other geographical or ethnic reports.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  - This report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. Streptococcus gordonii (Sg)/S. oralis (So)/S. sanguinis (Ss) and Sg/Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn)/Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of IL-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. Only the Sg/Actinomyces naeslundii (An)/Fn multispecies biofilms elicited IL-6 levels above those of control. IL-8 was a primary response to the Sg/An/Fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. These results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.
TI  - Effect of osteopontin on the initial adhesion of dental bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are involved in numerous infections of the human body, including dental caries. While conventional therapy of biofilm diseases aims at eradication and mechanical removal of the biofilms, recent therapeutic approaches target the mechanisms of biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion in particular. The effect of bovine milk osteopontin, a highly phosphorylated whey protein, on adhesion of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Actinomyces naeslundii, three prominent colonizers in dental biofilms, to saliva-coated surfaces was investigated. While adhesion of A. naeslundii was not affected by osteopontin, a strong, dose-dependent reduction in the number of adhering S. mitis was shown. No difference in bacterial adhesion was observed for caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. Osteopontin did not affect bacterial viability, but changed bacterial surface hydrophobicity, and may be suggested to prevent the adhesins of S. mitis from interacting with their salivary receptors. The antiadhesive effect of osteopontin may be useful for caries prevention.
TI  - Osteopontin reduces biofilm formation in a multi-species model of dental biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. Among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. Milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. We here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (OPN), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. While considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of OPN with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of OPN on bacterial biofilms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Biofilms consisting of Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus downei and Streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. Crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of OPN, as compared to biofilms grown without OPN or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. Confocal microscopy revealed that OPN bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. The bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of OPN. In particular, colonization of S. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: OPN strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. If a similar effect can be observed in vivo, OPN might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.
TI  - White-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  - White-spot lesions (WSL) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. We characterized the microbiota of WSL, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. Participants were 60 children with fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with WSL. Plaque samples were assayed by a 16S rRNA-based microarray (HOMIM) and by PCR. Mean gingival index was positively associated with WSL (p = 0.018). Taxa associated with WSL by microarray included Granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), Veillonellaceae sp. HOT 155 (p < 0.01), and Bifidobacterium Cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qPCR, Streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and Scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) Taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: Gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), Actinomyces sp. HOT 448 (p = 0.003), Prevotella cluster IV (p = 0.021), and Streptococcus sp. HOT 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of S. mutans (p = 0.02) and Bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qPCR. Species' associations with WSL were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without WSL. Granulicatella, Veillonellaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, in addition to S. mutans and S. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of WSL in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. Many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with WSL.
TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - Bacterial viability on surface-modified resin-based dental restorative materials.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. A novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(L) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. The non-modified resin was used as the standard (ST). The viability of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. Total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. Means, standard deviations, univariate ANOVA and multiple comparisons with post hoc Scheffe's tests were calculated. t-Test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. For all tests p<0.05 was chosen. NULL HYPOTHESIS: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. The test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than ST. But all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to ST. The contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total SFE and a low polar term of SFE resulted in fewer bacteria. The material's chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. Different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. The novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(L) active agents or with a low gamma(L) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.
TI  - Effects of xylitol on xylitol-sensitive versus xylitol-resistant Streptococcus mutans strains in a three-species in vitro biofilm.
AB  - We studied the effects of xylitol on biofilms containing xylitol-resistant (Xr) and xylitol-sensitive (Xs) Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii and S. sanguinis. The biofilms were grown for 8 and 24 h on hydroxyapatite discs. The viable microorganisms were determined by plate culturing techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using a S. mutans-specific probe. Extracellular cell-bound polysaccharides (EPS) were determined by spectrofluorometry from single-species S. mutans biofilms. In the presence of 5 % xylitol, the counts of the Xs S. mutans decreased tenfold in the young (8 h) biofilm (p < 0.05) but no effect was seen in the mature (24 h) biofilm. No decrease was observed for the Xr strains, and FISH confirmed these results. No differences were detected in the EPS production of the Xs S. mutans grown with or without xylitol, nor between Xr and Xs S. mutans strains. Thus, it seems that xylitol did not affect the EPS synthesis of the S. mutans strains. Since the Xr S. mutans strains, not inhibited by xylitol, showed no xylitol-induced decrease in the biofilms, we conclude that growth inhibition could be responsible for the decrease of the counts of the Xs S. mutans strains in the clinically relevant young biofilms.
TI  - Levels of Selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the levels of Selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized Selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique. Between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, S. sputigena and the Mitsuokella sp. Human Oral Taxon (HOT) 131 (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone CS002), while higher mean counts of Actinomyces gerencseriae and Streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Selenomonas sp. HOT 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. In the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of P. gingivalis and S. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. There were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of P. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), S. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and Selenomonas dianae (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone EW076) (r = 0.42, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S. sputigena and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated further.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. However, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. This report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. Monoinfection biofilms were developed with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. Biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, OKF4, for up to 24h. Gro-1alpha, IL1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, TGFalpha, Fractalkine, MIP-1alpha, and IP-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. P. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines, except MIP-1alpha. Generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited Gro-1alpha, TGFalpha, and Fractalkine production, while F. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IP-10. A. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10. The oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. Moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic effects of commercially available dentifrice containing aloe vera: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain plants used in folk medicine serve as a source of therapeutic agents that have antimicrobial and other multipotential effects. This prospective, randomized, placebo, and positively controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of a commercially available dentifrice containing aloe vera on the reduction of plaque and gingival inflammation in patients with gingivitis. METHODS: Ninety patients diagnosed with chronic generalized gingivitis were selected and randomly divided into three groups: group 1, placebo toothpaste; group 2, toothpaste containing aloe vera; and group 3, toothpaste with polymer and fluoride containing triclosan. Clinical evaluation was undertaken using a gingival index, plaque was assessed using a modification of the Quigley-Hein index, and microbiologic counts were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. A subjective evaluation was also undertaken by questionnaire. RESULTS: Toothpaste containing aloe vera showed significant improvement in gingival and plaque index scores as well as microbiologic counts compared with placebo dentifrice. These improvements were comparable to those achieved with toothpaste containing triclosan. CONCLUSION: Toothpaste containing aloe vera may be a useful herbal formulation for chemical plaque control agents and improvement in plaque and gingival status.
TI  - Effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. Poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of oral microorganisms. OBJECTIVES: To examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. Co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. RESULTS: Nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. All tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. The co-aggregation of Streptococcus oralis with A. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. The per cent co-aggregation of S. oralis with A. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - pH landscapes in a novel five-species model of early dental biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. Organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. During early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated pH drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. The complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. We then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular pH landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus downei and Actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. Biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. The architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. We employed the pH-sensitive ratiometric probe C-SNARF-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm pH in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. Anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. Decrease in pH in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular pH-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular pH. Ratiometric pH analysis using C-SNARF-4 gives detailed insight into the pH landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.
TI  - In situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  - Many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. However, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. As a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16S ribosomal RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus salivarius. Surfaces blasted with Al(2) O(3) (S(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (S(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (S(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned surfaces. Hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. Chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of Ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. After 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing S. sanguinis and A. naeslundii only). The biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.
TI  - Effects of compounds found in Nidus Vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Nidus Vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. Subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (Chl/MeOH) chemical extraction of Nidus Vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of Streptococcus mutans. In this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the Nidus Vespae Chl/MeOH extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the acid inhibition properties, anti-F-ATPase activity and anti-LDH activity against S. mutans. The isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. In addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-MIC levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity of S. mutans cells. Treated with the test agents, the F-ATPase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. The results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in Chl/MeOH extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that Nidus Vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.
TI  - Influence of topography and hydrophilicity on initial oral biofilm formation on microstructured titanium surfaces in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (Ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces israelii, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus sanguinis were tested on Ti surfaces: pretreatment (PT [R(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (A [R(a) <0.8 mum]), A modified to be hydrophilic (modA), sand-blasted/acid-etched (SLA [R(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic SLA (modSLA). Disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (CM) or human saliva (HS). The total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with CM compared with the samples incubated with HS. PT, SLA, and modSLA exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in CM, whereas SLA and modSLA had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in HS. The proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: SLA and modSLA increased the proportion of species like A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of A. israelii and P. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. CONCLUSIONS: The initial biofilm formation and composition were affected by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.
TI  - Novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  - Oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. Oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. To provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (RGPLs), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. Bacterial species belonging to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or three-species biofilms, with each group comprising Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguinis; S. gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum; or S. gordonii, F. nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in single-species and multispecies biofilms. We evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and Hoechst 33258 and novel SYTO red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. The specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Modeling of diffusion transport through oral biofilms with the inverse problem method.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the passive transport of macromolecules within dental biofilms. METHODOLOGY: Fluorescently labeled dextrans with different molecular mass (3 kD, 10 kD, 40 kD, 70 kD, 2000 kD) were used as a series of diffusion probes. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were used as inocula for biofilm formation. The diffusion processes of different probes through the in vitro biofilm were recorded with a confocal laser microscope. RESULTS: Mathematical function of biofilm penetration was constructed on the basis of the inverse problem method. Based on this function, not only the relationship between average concentration of steady-state and molecule weights can be analyzed, but also that between penetrative time and molecule weights. CONCLUSION: This can be used to predict the effective concentration and the penetrative time of anti-biofilm medicines that can diffuse through oral biofilm. Furthermore, an improved model for large molecule is proposed by considering the exchange time at the upper boundary of the dental biofilm.
TI  - Effect of nanoporous TiO2 coating and anodized Ca2+ modification of titanium surfaces on early microbial biofilm formation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The soft tissue around dental implants forms a barrier between the oral environment and the peri-implant bone and a crucial factor for long-term success of therapy is development of a good abutment/soft-tissue seal. Sol-gel derived nanoporous TiO2 coatings have been shown to enhance soft-tissue attachment but their effect on adhesion and biofilm formation by oral bacteria is unknown. METHODS: We have investigated how the properties of surfaces that may be used on abutments: turned titanium, sol-gel nanoporous TiO2 coated surfaces and anodized Ca2+ modified surfaces, affect biofilm formation by two early colonizers of the oral cavity: Streptococcus sanguinis and Actinomyces naeslundii. The bacteria were detected using 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization together with confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: Interferometry and atomic force microscopy revealed all the surfaces to be smooth (Sa</=0.22 mum). Incubation with a consortium of S. sanguinis and A. naeslundii showed no differences in adhesion between the surfaces over 2 hours. After 14 hours, the level of biofilm growth was low and again, no differences between the surfaces were seen. The presence of saliva increased the biofilm biovolume of S. sanguinis and A. naeslundii ten-fold compared to when saliva was absent and this was due to increased adhesion rather than biofilm growth. CONCLUSIONS: Nano-topographical modification of smooth titanium surfaces had no effect on adhesion or early biofilm formation by S. sanguinis and A. naeslundii as compared to turned surfaces or those treated with anodic oxidation in the presence of Ca2+. The presence of saliva led to a significantly greater biofilm biovolume but no significant differences were seen between the test surfaces. These data thus suggest that modification with sol-gel derived nanoporous TiO2, which has been shown to improve osseointegration and soft-tissue healing in vivo, does not cause greater biofilm formation by the two oral commensal species tested than the other surfaces.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Influence of Salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  - AIM: To investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) combined with Salvadora Persica Extract (SPE). METHODS: SPE was added to GIC (Fuji IX) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. The compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. The antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. GIC containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. RESULTS: Significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding SPE to GIC (p<0.05). GIC with 2 or 4 % SPE was significantly weaker than the GIC control, while GIC with 1% SPE was not different from the control. The mean values for the 4% SPE-containing specimens and the GIC control group ranged from 108.7MPa to 141.1MPa for CS and from 8.2MPa to 12.5MPa for DTS. The 1% SPE-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control GIC specimens; the 2% SPE-containing specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. As compared with pure GIC the antimicrobial properties of the SPE-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). It has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the GIC with increasing concentrations of SPE. For most microorganisms tested the SPE group inhibited less than Chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure GIC (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: SPE could be a promising natural material as an additive to GICs. Further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.
TI  - An antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. METHODS: Comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. The following microorganisms were investigated: Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei and Candida albicans. For cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (CFUs), Columbia blood agar plates or Sabouraud agar were used. The cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. Colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. The rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. All experiments were done twice and the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: There was no significant reduction in CFUs by silver-coated toothbrushes (P > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. On the contrary, the colony counts for S. sanguis (P = 0.02) and C. albicans (P = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. Silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. METHODS: Roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. Teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with standardized suspensions of Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. Teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed for 3 minutes with 15 mL of irrigant. Biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. Numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined via the standard spiral-plating methodology. Treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis procedure. Pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney procedure. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the Holm method with p < 0.05. RESULTS: Results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. Levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the NaOCl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) group for S. sanguinis, A. viscosus, and P. nigrescens. Results for F. nucleatum and P. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. It should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.
TI  - Investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of Chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - This study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. Forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (CM, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (CS, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. Total DNA was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. Using 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. Among them, Mitis group streptococci and Campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. In addition, Capnocytophaga, Burkholderia, and Prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the CS group samples (P < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of Neisseria, Leptotrichia, Haemophilus, Mutans group streptococci, Corynebacterium, and Actinomyces in the three groups. Further DGGE analysis of rnpB gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (P < 0.05), while that of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. Overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.
TI  - [Establishment and evaluation of the in vitro dynamic biofilm model].
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a dynamic model which could simulate the ecologic environment of oral cavity and study the cariogenicity of oral biofilm, continuously observe the formation of oral biofilm. METHODS: The fermental vessel and chemostat were designed according to the purpose of the study. Four strains of oral bacteria, namely Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii, were inoculated in the fermenter. The hydroxyapatite (HA) discs and glass slides were put in the chemostat. The temperature, oxide pressure, pH, dilution rate, circulation rate and substrate of the chemostat were carefully modulated. Distilled water and 25mM sucrose solution were used to test the stability of the system. At the beginning of the model establishment, the anabiosis bacteria were inoculated in fermenter full of fresh artificial saliva with a dilution rate of 10%. After the growth of bacteria in the fermenter was stable, the four-organism bacterial consortium was inoculated in the chemotat for 24 hours together with fresh artificial saliva (v/v=1:9). The organisms in planktonic phase were examined everyday. When the populations of consortium got stable(about 72 hours), the test solution was pulsed in the chemostat every 12 hours for 5 days. The HA discs and glass slides were observed every 24 hours for five times. The data was analyzed using SPSS 10.0 software package. Dunnet t test was used to compare the difference between the two groups at the level of alpha=0.05. RESULTS: The dynamic model was successfully established on oral biofilm study. With the pulse of sucrose solution, the environment in the chemostat simulated the cariogenic environment in nature, and all data namely the bacteria population, the biofilm microstructure changed with solution pulse. CONCLSUIONS: The model established is proved to be stable and the parameters in the model could be successfully controlled. The model fulfills the dynamic observation of formation of biofilm and caries lesion in vitro.
TI  - [Dissertations 25 years after date 21. Enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  - The aim of the research described in 'Chemotherapy against Streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating Actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. Actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. This was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. A 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. After a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. After several hours Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. Actinomyces naeslundii recovered later, but often with higher numbers. Mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. This led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. The combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. Recently, attention is also established for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.
TI  - Two new phenylpropanoid derivatives and other constituents from Illicium simonsii active against oral microbial organisms.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanol extract of the leaves and stems of Illicium simonsii led to the isolation of two new compounds, simonin A (1) and 1-hydroxyl-2- O- beta- D-6'-acetyl-glucopyranosyl-4-allylbenzene (2), along with eight known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. The isolates were tested for anti-oral microbial activity using a microdilution method. Compounds 1 and 3- 6 showed significant activities against oral microbial organisms (Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Actinomyces naeslundii), with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 1.95 to 31.25 microg/mL in vitro.
TI  - An in vitro antimicrobial activity of ten Iranian-made toothpastes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial agents have been used as a chemotherapeutic agent to improve oral health. This in vitro study was carried out to determine the antimicrobial activity of ten Iranian-made toothpastes against commonly found bacteria in the oral cavity. METHODS: The microorganisms used in this study were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Candida albicans. Sterile discs impregnated with 10 Iranian-made toothpastes; Paveh, Saviz, Latifeh II, Bath, Darugar II, Darugar I, Close up, Tage, Pooneh III and Nasim, which were separately used on agar plates. Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste and Sterile pyrogenfree distilled water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The samples were tested in triplicate, at full strength, 1:1 and 1:3 dilutions. Inhibition zones were measured in millimeter after 48 hr. The data were analyzed by the ANOVA and t-test. RESULTS: All tested toothpastes demonstrated an antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of Bath on S. mutans, Paveh on S. sanguis, Paveh, Saviz, Latifeh III and Darugar II on C. albicans were similar to the activity of Crest Cavity Protection. The antimicrobial activity of Pooneh III and Nasim on S. mutans, Bath on S. sanguis and A. viscosus, and Bath and Pooneh III on C. albicans were significantly higher and the others were significantly lower than the positive control. While, the activity of Crest Cavity Protection was the same as Pooneh III, it showed a weaker activity compared with Bath. CONCLUSION: Apart from Bath and Pooneh III, the other Iranian-made toothpastes tested in this study showed a lower antimicrobial activity compared to Crest Cavity Protection.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Bacteriostatic effect of Piper betle and Psidium guajava extracts on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bacteriostatic effect of Piper betle and Psidium guajava extracts on selected early dental plaque bacteria was investigated based on changes in the doubling time (g) and specific growth rates (micro). Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces sp. were cultured in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) in the presence and absence of the extracts. The growth of bacteria was monitored periodically every 15 min over a period of 9 h to allow for a complete growth cycle. Growth profiles of the bacteria in the presence of the extracts were compared to those in the absence and deviation in the g and micro were determined and analyzed. It was found that the g and mu were affected by both extracts. At 4 mg mL(-1) of P. betle the g-values for S. sanguinis and S. mitis were increased by 12.0- and 10.4-fold, respectively (p < 0.05). At similar concentration P. guajava increased the g-value by 1.8- and 2.6 -fold, respectively (p < 0.05). The effect on Actinomyces sp. was observed at a much lower magnitude. It appears that P. betle and P. guajava extracts have bacteriostatic effect on the plaque bacteria by creating a stressed environment that had suppressed the growth and propagation of the cells. Within the context of the dental plaque, this would ensure the attainment of thin and healthy plaque. Thus, decoctions of these plants would be suitable if used in the control of dental plaque.
TI  - Transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and Lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental plaque pH decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low pH is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. Repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. The acidification also influences plaque bacteria. Severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. We, therefore, investigated the effects of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Actinomyces naeslundii were used. Effects of physiological acidification at pH 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at pH 4.0-7.0, were investigated. RESULTS: Mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus grew at pH 4.0 but the growth of S. sanguinis and S. oralis ceased below pH 4.2 and pH 4.2-4.4, respectively. Acidification at pH 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and Actinomyces, respectively. Furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of S. sanguinis, S. oralis and Actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental pH had returned to 7.0. The acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.
TI  - Activity of panduratin A isolated from Kaempferia pandurata Roxb. against multi-species oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  - The formation of dental biofilm caused by oral bacteria on tooth surfaces is the  primary step leading to oral diseases. This study was performed to investigate the preventive and reducing effects of panduratin A, isolated from Kaempferia pandurata Roxb., against multi-species oral biofilms consisting of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of panduratin A was determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution assay. Prevention of biofilm formation was performed on 96-well microtiter plates by coating panduratin A in mucin at 0.5-40 microg/ml, followed by biofilm formation at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The reducing effect on the preformed biofilm was tested by forming the biofilm at 37 degrees C for 24 h, followed by treatment with panduratin A at 0.2-10 microg/ml for up to 60 min. Panduratin A showed a MIC of 1 microg/ml for multi-species strains. Panduratin A at 2 x MIC for 8 h exhibited bactericidal activity against multi-species planktonic cells for 8 h. At 8 x MIC, panduratin A was able to prevent biofilm formation by > 50%. Biofilm mass was reduced by > 50% after exposure to panduratin A at 10 microg/ml for 15 min. Panduratin A showed a dose-dependent effect in preventing and reducing the biofilm. These results suggest that panduratin A is applicable as a natural anti-biofilm agent to eliminate oral bacterial colonization during early dental plaque formation.
TI  - Correlations of oral bacterial arginine and urea catabolism with caries experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Alkali generation by oral bacteria plays a key role in plaque pH  homeostasis and may be a major impediment to the development of dental caries. To determine if the capacity of oral samples to produce ammonia from arginine or urea was related to caries experience, the arginine deiminase system (ADS) and urease activity in saliva and dental plaque samples were measured in 45 adult subjects. METHODS: The subjects were divided into three groups according to caries status; 13 caries-free (CF) individuals (decayed, missing, and filled teeth = 0); 21 caries-active (CA) individuals (decayed teeth >or= 4); and 11 caries-experienced (CE) individuals (decayed teeth = 0; missing and filled teeth > 0). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the proportion of certain acid- or alkali-producing organisms in the samples. RESULTS: The amount of ammonia generated from the test substrates by plaque samples was generally higher than that produced by salivary samples in all groups. Significantly higher levels of salivary ADS activity and plaque urease activity were observed in CF subjects compared to CA subjects (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.014, respectively). The proportions of Streptococcus mutans from saliva and dental plaque of CA subjects were significantly higher than those from the CF group (P = 0.0153 and P = 0.0009, respectively). In the CA group, there was an inverse relationship between urease activity and the levels of S. mutans (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study supports the theory that increased caries risk is associated with reduced alkali-generating capacity of the bacteria colonizing the oral cavity; providing compelling evidence to further our understanding of oral alkali-generation in health and disease.
TI  - Distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in samples from five different oral habitats in young Greek children. DESIGN: Ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + SD 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). Samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. Mean proportions of Streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and Streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for Lactobacillus acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. Soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. These surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.
TI  - [Protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  - Microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific IgA1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. Microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. Nonspecific proteolytic activity was found in the following microorganisms: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Aerococcus viridans, Bifidobacterium longum, Neisseria subflave, Streptococcus parvulus, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Lactobaccilus catenoforme, Bacillus spp. Specific IgA1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards IgG was found in Streptococcus acidominimus, Streptococcus hansenii, Streptococcus salivarius, Leptotrychia buccalis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Neisseria sicca. No proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of Eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), Prevotella buccalis, Aerococcus viridans and Streptococcus sanguis.
TI  - Factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. II. Tooth position.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Little is known regarding the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that tooth location affects the microbial composition of supragingival plaque beyond the effect due to plaque mass as reflected by total DNA probe count. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal aspect of each tooth in 187 subjects (n = 4745 samples). All samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences in mean species counts and proportions were determined among tooth surfaces and six tooth type categories: molars, bicuspids, incisors/canines in the mandible and maxilla separately using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Stepwise multiple linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between species proportions and total DNA probe count, tooth location, periodontal and smoking status, age and sex. RESULTS: All species differed significantly among tooth types and among the six tooth categories. Higher plaque levels were seen on molars and lower incisors. Some differences observed between tooth types could be partly explained by the level of plaque. Teeth with high plaque mass exhibited high levels of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Campylobacter rectus and Campylobacter showae. However, certain species, such as Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus sanguinis, differed significantly at different tooth locations despite similarities in plaque mass. Twenty of the test species exhibited a significant association with tooth location after adjusting for total DNA probe count and subject level factors. CONCLUSION: While plaque mass was associated with differences in proportions of many species in supragingival biofilms, tooth location also was strongly associated with species proportions in both univariate and multivariate analyses.
TI  - Anticaries effect of compounds extracted from Galla chinensis in a multispecies biofilm model.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Galla Chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. Using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of Galla Chinensis and its chemical fractions. METHODS: A four-organism bacterial consortium (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. Galla Chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed into different flow cells. The pH value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the HA discs were counted. Enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. The biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. RESULTS: When Galla Chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase pH remained higher than that in the sucrose alone. A lower level of colonization on the HA surface was also observed in the groups to which Galla Chinensis and fluoride were added compared with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less compact biofilm, respectively. Enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the Galla Chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. CONCLUSIONS: Galla Chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. Galla Chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents that may prevent dental caries.
TI  - MLPA diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  - A multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. However, multiplex PCR techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube PCR. Here we report a novel use of MLPA in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. We designed 9 species specific probes for: Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral Streptococci and Lactobacilli based on their 16S rDNA sequences. MLPA analysis of DNA pooled from the strains showed the expected specific MLPA products. Relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar DNA showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. Moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests MLPA can be a cheaper alternative to using qPCR for quantification. We observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of MLPA products in DNAs isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. Furthermore, MLPA analyses of DNA isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. This clearly shows the usefulness of MLPA in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.
TI  - Interactions between salivary Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  - Coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. Bifidobacterium adolescentis OLB6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with Actinomyces naeslundii JCM8350, Streptococcus mitis OLS3293, Streptococcus sanguinis JCM5708, Veillonella parvula ATCC17745 or Porphyromonas gingivalis OB7124, but it did coaggregate with Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532. Subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using FISH revealed that B. adolescentis OLB6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. It did, however, adhere to biofilms of A. naeslundii, V. parvula, and F. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with A. naeslundii nor with V. parvula. These results suggest that the adhesion of B. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. Heat- or proteinase K-treated F. nucleatum could not coaggregate with B. adolescentis. Similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase K-treated B. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. It is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of B. adolescentis and F. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. The data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.
TI  - SMAP29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. SMAP29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of SMAP29, SMAP28, and three congeners (SMAP18A, SMAP18D, and SMAP14A). METHODS: The peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity against multiple strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. Cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. RESULTS: SMAP28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, P < 0.05); however, the activity of SMAP28 and SMAP29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). The congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). Overall, F. nucleatum was the most susceptible organism, while P. gingivalis was the least susceptible. Keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. SMAP28 was the most cytotoxic, while SMAP14A was the least cytotoxic. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of SMAP29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other oral diseases.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - [Effects of traditional Chinese medicine on oral bacteria biofilm].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of compounds of Galla chinensis extract (GCE) and Nidus vespae extract-1 (WVE1) on oral bacteria biofilm structure and activity and to determine the possibility of caries prevention by the compounds. METHODS: The morphology and activity of treated-oral bacterial biofilm and untreated-oral bacterial biofilm were observed by using fluorescence microscope in combination of idio-fluorochrome to label the died and living bacteria. The visible light semiquantitative method was used to measure biomass glucosyltransferase (GTF, A620) values and to determine the effects of active compounds of GCE and NVE1 on GTF of oral bacteria biofilm. RESULTS: The living bacteria in the untreated 24 h bacterial biofilm was dominant, and only a small number of died bacteria were found, the biofilm structure was regular and clear. GCE, GCE-B and NVE1 could inhibit the bacteria in the dental biofilm, which showed significant difference with the negative control. GCE and NVE1 could also inhibit GTF activity of 24 h bacterial biofilm in comparison with the negative control. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional Chinese medicine Galla chinensis and Nidus vespae could not only inhibit bacteria growth on oral bacterial biofilm, but also function by adjusting biofilm structure, composition and GTF activity of 24 h bacterial biofilm.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (RT group) and in 13 matched controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. A clinical examination was also performed. RESULTS: Candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the RT subjects and in 15% of the controls. In three RT subjects, C. albicans was found at all four sites analysed. An unexpected finding was that enterococci were found in all RT subjects and in high number in 38%. None of the controls harboured enterococci. In supragingival plaque, Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the RT subjects and the number and proportion of Lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. Mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the RT subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. CONCLUSION: The microbial results explain why some RT subjects have an increased susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for RT subjects.
TI  - Reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. In many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. An alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. METHODS: Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were evaluated as potential antagonists against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, P. intermedia ATCC 49046, and A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 as periodontopathogens. Adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. RESULTS: The largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for P. gingivalis. All antagonistic strains except S. crista ATCC 49999 inhibited the adhesion of P. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for A. naeslundii ATCC 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). Adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718. Intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for P. intermedia, most notably caused by S. mitis BMS. CONCLUSION: The adhesion of P. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while S. mitis BMS appeared to be the most successful antagonist.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  - Extracts or alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a M. aquifolium extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the M. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. The values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. The most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was Porphyromonas gingivalis.
TI  - In vitro anti-biofilm activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans Houtt. against oral primary colonizer bacteria.
AB  - In early dental plaque formation, oral primary colonizers such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus are initially attached to the pellicle-coated tooth surface to form a biofilm. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of macelignan, isolated from nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt.), in removing each single oral primary biofilm in vitro on a polystyrene 96-well microtiter plate. Four biofilm growth phases (4, 12, 20 and 24 h) were evaluated in this study after treatment with macelignan at various concentrations (0.2, 2 and 10 microg/mL) and exposure times (5, 10 and 30 min). Anti-biofilm activity of macelignan was measured as the percentage of the remaining biofilm absorbance after macelignan treatment in comparison with the untreated control. At 24 h of biofilm growth, S. mutans, A. viscosus and S. sanguis biofilms were reduced by up to 30%, 30% and 38%, respectively, after treatment with 10 microg/mL macelignan for 5 min. Increasing the treatment time to 30 min resulted in a reduction of more than 50% of each of the single primary biofilms. The results indicate that macelignan is a potent natural anti-biofilm agent against oral primary colonizers.
TI  - [Effects of the active compounds of M. officinalis on cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the principal biologically active compounds of M. officinalis on the growth and acid generation of the main cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus were chosen as the experimental bacteria. The active compounds (Magnolol and Honokiol) were separated from M. officinalis and then the effects of the two agents on the growth and acid generation of the bacteria were assessed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of the test strains were determined by MBEC-Device. RESULTS: It was found that the growth of not only plantonic bacteria but also the biofilm were efficiently inhibited by Magnolol and Honokiol. The two agents could also inhibit the acid production of the test strains. CONCLUSION: M. officinalis may be an effective anti-caries agent, and further researches will be necessary to define its usefulness in this aspect.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - [Study of susceptibility of oral bacteria biofilm to traditional Chinese drug preventing caries].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using MBEC-Assay to assay minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of Galla Chinensis and Nidus Vespae to oral bacterial biofilm. To set up traditional Chinese medicine susceptibility pharmacodynamic empirical study methods of oral bacterial biofilm. METHODS: Cariogenic bacteria strains were selected (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627) in this study. Extraction components of Galla Chinensis were GCE (aqueous extract), GCE-B (30% alcohol extract) and extraction components of Nidus Vespae were NVE1 (95% alcohol extract). (1) To observe oral bacterial biofilm formatiom in MBEC-Device at different time. (2) MBEC-HTP-Assay: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of GCE, GCE-B and NVE1 to oral bacteria strains were determined. RESULTS: Oral bacterial biofilm were readily formed on the lid of MBEC-Device under selected condition (observed by SEM). Oral cariogenic bacteria growing as plankton populations were sensitive to GCE, GCE-B and NVE1. To GCE, GCE-B and NVE1, oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm were 2-16 times less susceptible than growing plankton bacteria. GCE and GCE-B were the most effective medicine against oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm. NVE1 were effective in killing oral-bacterial biofilm at relatively high concentration. CONCLUSION: GCE and GCE-B were effective medicine against oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm. MBEC (minimal biofilm eradication concentration) can provide a relative accurate medicine concentration for clinical test.
TI  - Effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  - Dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. Bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. Recent literature has demonstrated that infrared CO(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. In this study, a XeCl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (Summit Technology, Boston, USA). Both aerobe (Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii) and anaerobe microorganisms (A. odontolyticus, Prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. According to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 J/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 Hz were used for all irradiations. Colony-forming units after laser irradiation were counted. Excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. As compared to S. mutans and S. sanguis, A. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. Anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. Excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. Depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. New studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other wavelengths or conventional therapies.
TI  - Multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  - Clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. The crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. Concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. Comparable numbers of Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Neisseria subflava, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. Quantitative fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. Biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific fluorescent stains. Anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm EPS and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (P < 0.05). Sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm EPS in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (P < 0.05). CLSM demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm EPS, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (P < 0.05). Agents in oral hygiene formulations (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (P < 0.05). Multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm EPS and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.
TI  - The effect of saliva or serum on bacterial and Candida albicans colonization on type I collagen.
AB  - Colonization of Candida albicans on oral surfaces can serve as a reservoir for disseminated infections, such as aspiration pneumonia and gastrointestinal infection, particularly in the immunocompromised host. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of salivary and serum pellicles on C. albicans, Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces colonization on type I collagen, a major organic component of periodontal ligaments. The colonization potential of two isolates each of C. albicans, S. mutans and S. sanguis, and a single isolate each of Lactobacillus and Actinomyces to uncoated (control), saliva-coated or serum-coated type I collagen plates (surface area 143 mm(2), Cell Disk; Sumitomo, Tokyo, Japan) was examined using a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate assay based on firefly luciferase-luciferin system. The results revealed that with mutans streptococci, a saliva pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting bacterial colonization compared with the pellicle-free collagen disc, and the serum-coated sample significantly inhibited the colonization of streptococci (anova; P < 0b01). In contrast, in the case of C. albicans, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces isolates, a serum pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting the colonization, followed by saliva pellicle and uncoated specimen (anova; P < 0b01). These results suggested that crevicular fluid rich in seruminous components would promote the colonization of Candida, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces on type I collagen as opposed to streptococci which showed greater avidity to saliva-coated collagen.
TI  - Expression of the short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  - The Mfa1 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii. We utilized a promoter-lacZ reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. Promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus cristatus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. Expression of SspA/B, the streptococcal receptor for Mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. Proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of Mfa1 expression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.
TI  - The effect of Piper betle and Psidium guajava extracts on the cell-surface hydrophobicity of selected early settlers of dental plaque.
AB  - The adhesion of early settlers of dental plaque to the tooth surface has a role in the initiation of the development of dental plaque. The hydrophobic surface properties of the bacteria cell wall are indirectly responsible for the adhesion of the bacteria cell to the acquired pellicle on the tooth surfaces. In this study, the effect of aqueous extract of two plants (Psidium guajava and Piper betle) on the cell-surface hydro-phobicity of early settlers of dental plaque was determined in vitro. Hexadecane, a hydrocarbon was used to represent the hydrophobic surface of the teeth in the oral cavity. It was found that treatment of the early plaque settlers with 1 mg/ml extract of Psidium guajava reduced the cell-surface hydrophobicity of Strep. sanguinis, Strep. mitis and Actinomyces sp. by 54.1%, 49.9% and 40.6%, respectively. Treatment of these bacteria with the same concentration of Piper betle however, showed a comparatively lesser effect (< 10%). It was also observed that the anti-adhesive effect of the two extracts on the binding of the early plaque settlers to hexadecane is concentration dependent.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  - Bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. This study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. Samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. Bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. The presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard method. The most frequently detected species were Porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), Treponema denticola (38%), Prevotella intermedia (37%), Streptococcus intermedius (36%), Campylobacter rectus (35%), Streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and Streptococcus oralis (34%). Species of Actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. The data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage and level of any specific species were found between these sites. Veillonella parvula, S. oralis, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. These findings demonstrated that a wide range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.
TI  - Interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating oral bacterial pairs.
AB  - The temporo-spatial development of plaque is governed by adhesive interactions between different co-aggregating bacterial strains and species. Physico-chemically, these interactions are due to attractive Lifshitz-Van der Waals and acid-base forces, and occur despite electrostatic repulsion and with a critical influence of temperature. The forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs have never been measured, however. The aim here, thus, is to investigate, by atomic force microscopy, whether there is a difference in interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating bacterial pairs at 10 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 40 degrees C. Actinomyces naeslundii 147 was immobilized on poly-L-lysine-coated tipless AFM cantilevers, while streptococci were immobilized on poly-L-lysine-coated glass surfaces. Upon approach, a repulsive force was measured, regardless of whether a co-aggregating or non-co-aggregating pair was involved. However, upon retraction, the co-aggregating pair exhibited larger adhesive forces and energies than did the non-co-aggregating pair. Adhesive interactions between the co-aggregating pair were smallest at 40 degrees C.
TI  - [Study of antibacterial effect of Galla Chinensis on the bacteria biofilm in chemostat].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antibacterial effect of Galla Chinensis with that of chlorhexidine by means of chemostat and provide experimental foundation for caries prevention with Chinese medicine instead of chemicals in future. METHOD: A multispecies consortium biofilm (BF) model was construted in the chemostat. The growth-inhibition on bacterial biofilm coated on HA was investigated by means of the colony-forming units (CFU). Acid-inhibition was inspected by continual pH-recording in the flow cells. And the profile on the biofilm treated by both experimental medicines was observed with the scanning electromicroscopy (SEM). RESULT: Both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the growth of the BF bacteria. And Galla Chinensis had no obvious influence on the ecological composing of the BF bacteria. Both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the acid producion of experimental bacteria. But the final pH of Galla Chinensis was lower than that of chlorhexidine. A typical biofilm formed on HA was observed by SEM. Both of Galla chinensis and chlorhexidine could inhibit the production of extracellular matrix and make the BF profile on the surface of the HA clearer and simpler. CONCLUSION: Galla Chinensis had definite antibacterial effect. No obvious difference is found between Galla Chinensis (4 g x L(-1)) and chlorhexidine (0.5 g x L(-1)). Therefore, it is possible for Chinese medicine to gradually replace the chemical medicine in clinic and it will give a new choice for caries prevention.
TI  - [Comparison of Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride on growth and metabolism of bacteria in biofilm model].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and Galla  Chinesis in bioflim model. To evaluate the feasibility of application of Gala Chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. In the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. After a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the HA disc was examed, the planktonic pH in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the HA disc was observed by SEM. RESULTS: (1) Galla Chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic pH in the flow cell, but Galla Chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) The biofilms formed after application of Galla Chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. CONCLUSION: Galla Chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.
TI  - Microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  - The aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16S RNA gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. A total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. We compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. A panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a PCR-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. A simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the healthy groups. Features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. Furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. Our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. The top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were Actinomyces sp. strain B19SC, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as Streptococcus parasanguinis, Abiotrophia defectiva, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguinis.
TI  - [An in vitro study on effect of Nidus vespae extract on the acid production of three strains of oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To inquire into the effect of different of Nidus Vespae extract (NVE)  on growth and acid production of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 and Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 were chosen as the experimental bacteria. Four extracts of Nidus Vespae were prepared and then the effects of these Nidus Vespae extracts on the acid production were determined. RESULTS: All of Nidus Vespae extracts could inhibit the growth the of the three strains, and NVE1, NVE3, NVE4 could inhibit the acid production of the three strains, NVE2 could inhibit the acid production of Actinomyces viscosus. CONCLUSION: Four extracts of Nidus Vespae could inhibit the acid production of three bacteria strains.
TI  - Microcalorimetric study on the influence of temperature on bacterial coaggregation.
AB  - Binding isotherms and heats of interaction have been determined at 15, 25, and 40 degrees C for a coaggregating and a non-coaggregating oral bacterial pair. Heats of interaction were measured upon three consecutive injections of streptococci into an actinomyces suspension using isothermal titration calorimetry. After each injection, the number of streptococci injected remaining free in suspension was quantified microscopically and the degree of binding between the two bacterial strains was established. The coaggregating pair shows positive cooperative binding. The highest cooperativity, at 25 degrees C, correlates with a strong, macroscopically visible coaggregation. The non-coaggregating pair shows low cooperativity and lacks macroscopically visible coaggregation. Interactions between the coaggregating partners seem to be mainly due to specific, enthalpically saturable and favorable binding sites. Even though the enthalpic part of the interaction is saturated, cooperativity increases with consecutive injections, implying that the coaggregation phenomenon is driven by entropy gain. The change in heat capacity (DeltaC(p)) is positive for the non-coaggregating pair from 15-40 degrees C as well as for the coaggregating pair beyond 25 degrees C. At lower temperatures the coaggregating pair causes a negative DeltaC(p). The decrease in heat capacity together with an increase in entropy is considered to be indicative of hydrophobic interactions playing an important role in the formation of large coaggregates as observed for the coaggregating pair at 25 degrees C.
TI  - Scaling and root planing, systemic metronidazole and professional plaque removal  in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a Brazilian population II--microbiological results.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (SRP) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned in four treatment groups, a control (C, n=10) that received SRP and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: T1 (n=12): SRP and metronidazole (M, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; T2 (n=12): SRP, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (PC) and placebo; and T3 (n=10): SRP, M and PC. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. Counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences over time was determined using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. RESULTS: The mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. Counts (x 10(5)+/-SEM) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups T2 and T3. Levels of beneficial species, such as some Actinomyces species, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (T3). Mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group T3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group T2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group T1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group C (NS). Proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups T2 and T3. CONCLUSIONS: All treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. Adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.
TI  - [The effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of Galla Chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of Galla Chinensis extract. METHODS: Four different components (GCE1, GCE2, GCE3 and GCE4) were separated from Galla Chinensis and there antibacterial activities to Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus salivarius SS 196, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413 were checked. There effects on the growth curve of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were also investigated. RESULTS: The most effective part of Galla Chinensis was found to be GCE2 and GCE4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. All of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. CONCLUSION: All of the 4 different components of Galla Chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of Galla Chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.
TI  - Differences in the subgingival microbiota of Swedish and USA subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. METHOD: One hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (N Sweden=79; USA=79) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, BOP, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=4345). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in Swedish than American subjects: Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); Streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); Eikenella corrodens (1.7, 1.0); Tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and Prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). Leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in American (5.5) than Swedish subjects (3.0). Cluster analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. Twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. Five clusters were dominated by American subjects and 2 clusters by Swedish subjects. Fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the Swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by high proportions of A. naeslundii genospecies 1, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythensis and P. melaninogenica. Other clusters were characterized by high proportions of Actinomyces gerencseriae, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eubacterium saburreum, L. buccalis and Neisseria mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. The heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the American subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the American subjects sampled.
TI  - Path-dependency of the interaction between coaggregating and between non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a thermodynamic approach.
AB  - Coaggregation, i.e. specific recognition between bacteria from different species, is a well-described phenomenon in the human oral cavity but remains physically poorly understood. With our study we aimed at elucidating some aspects of the mechanism of the coaggregation between the oral bacteria Streptococcus oralis J22 and Actinomyces naeslundii 147, in particular with respect to the driving force for coaggregation and its pathway-dependency. To that end, the macroscopic turbidity of the bacterial suspension, the morphology of the coaggregates, binding isotherms and heats of interaction were compared between the above-mentioned coaggregating bacterial pair and a non-coaggregating pair, Streptococcus sanguis PK1889 and A. naeslundii 147. The coaggregating pair forms large aggregates, which rapidly sediment from the suspension while the non-coaggregating pair forms only very small coaggregates that remain homogeneously suspended. Coaggregation is further characterized by a high affinity between the partner cells that bind to each other in a strong cooperative mode. The interactions between both pairs occur under the release of heat and are thus enthalpically favorable. More heat is released for the coaggregating than for the non-coaggregating pair. Adding the coaggregating bacteria in steps to each other leads to saturation of enthalpically favorable binding sites. This is observed when the streptococcus is added to the actinomyces as well as when the addition is done the other way around. It is concluded that the cooperativity of the coaggregation process is based on an increase of entropy. It is furthermore shown that the density of the coaggregates as well as the heat effect of formation of these coaggregates depend on the number of steps in which the partner cells are added to each other. Adding S. oralis J22 in three steps to A. naeslundii 147 results in the formation of denser coaggregates under the release of less heat, as compared to that of addition in one step. These differences point to a larger entropy increase when in a step-wise mixing the coaggregating bacteria are allowed to form more densely-packed coaggregates.
TI  - The antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices: results of an in vitro diffusion method study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of Americans are using natural herbal products for general and oral health care. Few of these products, however, have undergone rigorous testing, as evidenced by the limited amount of information on their safety and efficacy in the literature. The authors conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices. METHODS: The authors used a diffusion method to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of 14 natural herbal dentifrices against four microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Candida albicans. Colgate Total (Colgate-Palmolive, New York City) and sterile pyrogen-free water served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. The authors tested the natural herbal dentifrices at full strength and at 1:1 dilution. They measured the zones of inhibition at 24 and 48 hours to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the dentifrices. RESULTS: Six herbal dentifrices were effective in inhibiting the growth of all four microorganisms. The positive control produced significantly sized inhibition zones with all four microorganisms, while the negative control produced no observable zones. Six herbal dentifrices produced larger inhibition zones with A. viscosus than did the positive control. Six herbal dentifrices were inhibitory against C. albicans at full strength, but at 1:1 dilution, only three had such inhibitory effect. One herbal dentifrice produced microbial growth around and over the samples, indicating possible microbial contamination of the toothpaste. Only one herbal dentifrice showed consistent antimicrobial activity against all four microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in antimicrobial inhibition among the herbal dentifrices indicates that more research is needed to validate their effectiveness claims. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study provides practitioners with insight into the claims of natural herbal dentifrices' antimicrobial effects.
TI  - A simple approach to examine early oral microbial biofilm formation and the effects of treatments.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A simple in vivo approach to examine early dental plaque formation in the human mouth and to determine the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures on biofilm formation is reported. METHODS: A custom designed device that fits securely behind the teeth of the mandibular arch provides a surface for microbial colonization. This device is prepared with denture acrylic and can be repeatedly used by the subject, exposing a large and constant surface area for microbial accumulation. RESULTS: Large numbers of oral bacteria colonized the device by 2 h; these increased significantly by 4 h (P < 0.05). Bacterial colonization increased significantly after rinsing with a sucrose solution (P < 0.05) but remained unaffected after rinsing with water, a commercially available fluoride mouthrinse without antimicrobial agents, or brushing with a fluoride dentifrice (P > 0.05). Rinsing with mouthrinses formulated with chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride or triclosan/copolymer significantly inhibited colonization (P < 0.05). A dose-dependent inhibition was noted with chlorhexidine rinses (P < 0.05). Brushing with a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited microbial colonization compared with a control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This simple approach was useful for examining the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures. Significant biofilm inhibitory effects were noted with formulations that demonstrated efficacy in previous clinical studies.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: Endo Fill, Endomethasone, Endomethasone N, Sealer 26 and AH-Plus, against the following microorganisms: Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces naeslundii. The sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.The direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. The results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, Endo-Fill and Endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. Sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. At all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. In conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon the microbial susceptibility to them.
TI  - [Analysis of oral microflora early colonized in infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamic changes of oral microflora early colonized in infants. METHODS: The oral swab samples for the study were taken in 1 day, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after birth from 12 healthy neonates. By choosing suitable diluted concentration, the samples were incubated aerobically, facultative anaerobically and anaerobically. The strains were identified by observing colony characteristics, Gram staining and biochemical tests. RESULTS: S. salivarius was the most frequent microflora, followed by S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii and S. mutans occurred in oral cavity after tooth eruption. Veillonella spp. can be detected in oral cavity of 1-month-old babies, A. odontolyticus was isolated from 8.3% infants of more than 3 months old. L. acidophilus maintained the lower prevalence in oral cavity of babies. Leptotrichia buccalis and Capnocytophaga spp. occurred in oral cavity of some dentate infants. CONCLUSION: S. solivarius and S. mitis are predominant species in oral cavity of the infants, Veillonella spp. is the first and the most anaerobic species appeared in oral cavity of healthy babies. A. odontolyticus is the first actinomyces detected in oral cavity. With the increasing months, kind and amount of microflora increase dramatically.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Salivary receptors for the proline-rich protein-binding and lectin-like adhesins  of oral actinomyces and streptococci.
AB  - Colonization of the tooth surface by actinomyces and viridans group streptococci  involves the attachment of these bacteria to adsorbed salivary components of the acquired enamel pellicle. The hypothesis that this attachment depends on specific adhesins has now been assessed from the binding of bacteria with well-defined adhesive properties to blots of SDS-PAGE-separated parotid and submandibular-sublingual (SM-SL) saliva. Streptococcus sanguis and type 2 fimbriated Actinomyces naeslundii, which bound terminal sialic acid and Galbeta1-3GalNAc, respectively, recognized only a few SM-SL salivary components, primarily MG2. In contrast, type 1 fimbriated A. naeslundii and S. gordonii, which bound purified proline-rich proteins (PRPs), recognized several other components from both SM-SL and parotid saliva. Significantly, bacteria that lacked PRP-binding and the lectin-like activities detected by binding to MG2 failed to bind any immobilized salivary component. These findings suggest the involvement of specific adhesins in bacterial recognition of many adsorbed salivary proteins and glycoproteins.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
TI  - [Dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. METHODS: Eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Provotella intermedium (Pi), Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces viscosus (Av) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) were used. These eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified BM medium supplemented with 2.5 g/L porcine gastric mucin, respectively. After 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial Gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. RESULTS: Biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (P < 0.001). Biofilms of Aa were thinner than those of Ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by Ss and Aa per time point. Three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of Gram-negative periodontal pathogens. The relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.
TI  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (HBD-2 and HBD-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. A few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. However, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of HBD-2 and HBD-3 against a collection of oral organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida albicans). Radial diffusion assays were used to test HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. There was significant variability in MICs, which was strain specific rather than species specific. MICs ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-3. HBD-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. Overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, respectively. HBD-2 and HBD-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against the Candida species evaluated. Interestingly, an association between HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities was noted. This suggests that the two peptides may have similar mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. The lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and Candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. Finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - [The in vitro study on Polistes mandarinus' effects on cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of Polistes mandarinus on the growth,acid generation and water insoluble glucan(WIG) production of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus as a preparation for screening an effective agent ot medicate the balance of oral microflora. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans 3a3, Streptococcus sanguis SB 179 and Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 were chosen as the experimental bacteria. The effects of Polistes mandarinus on the growth, acid generation and glucan production were observed. RESULTS: Polistes mandarinus can inhibit the growth and acid generation of S.mutans,S.sanguis and A.viscosus, and the water-insoluble glucan production of S.mutants and S.sanguis effectively. CONCLUSION: Polistes mandarinus can inhibit the growth, acid generation and glucan production of oral bacteria effectively.
TI  - Influence of weight on removal of co-adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by different modes of brushing.
AB  - This study compared removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci from salivary pellicles by manual, rotating/oscillating electric and sonic toothbrushes, applying weights up to 240 g. First, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 degrees C. On average, 34-39% of the adhering bacteria were adhering as single organisms. For co-adhering and non-co-adhering pairs, 33 and 10% of the adhering bacteria were involved, respectively, in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. Brushing by hand removed 82% at low weight (40 g), which was less than by electric (93%) or sonic (92%) brushing, while for all modes of brushing bacterial removal increased with increasing weight to 95-99%. For a non-co-adhering pair, subsequent exposure of brushed pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded only 2-16% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, regardless of the mode of brushing. For the co-adhering pair, however, de novo streptococcal adhesion to hand-brushed pellicles yielded 34-57% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, while electric and sonic brushing left 22-35% of the bacteria involved in large aggregates. De novo streptococcal adhesion for the co-adhering pair increased with increasing weight for the electric and sonic brush in contrast to the manual brush. Since a strong influence of co-adhesion is evident in de novo streptococcal adhesion, despite nearly complete removal of all actinomyces, these observations suggest that the three modes of brushing leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.
TI  - The anti-adherence effect of Piper betle and Psidium guajava extracts on the adhesion of early settlers in dental plaque to saliva-coated glass surfaces.
AB  - The aqueous extracts of Piper betle and Psidium guajava were prepared and tested  for their anti-adherence effect on the adhesion of early plaque settlers (Strep. mitis, Strep. sanguinis and Actinomyces sp.). The saliva-coated glass surfaces were used to simulate the pellicle-coated enamel surface in the oral cavity. Our results showed that the anti-adherence activities of Piper betle and Psidium guajava extracts towards the bacteria were different between the bacterial species. Psidium guajava was shown to have a slightly greater anti-adherence effect on Strep. sanguinis by 5.5% and Actinomyces sp. by 10% and a significantly higher effect on Strep. mitis (70%) compared to Piper betle. The three bacterial species are known to be highly hydrophobic, and that hydrophobic bonding seemed to be an important factor in their adherence activities. It is therefore suggested that the plant extracts, in expressing their anti-adherence activities, could have altered the hydrophobic nature of the bonding between the bacteria and the saliva-coated glass surfaces.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro cario-static effect of Galla chinensis with biofilm model].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro cario-static effect of Galla chinesis with biofilm model. METHODS: A four-organism bacterial consortium was cultured in a biofilm model on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulsing. There were three groups with different solution pulsed in the model: negative control group was pulsed with distilled water, positive control group was pulsed with 100 mmol/L sucrose solution and experimental group was pulsed with 100 mmol/L sucrose solution containing 4.0 g/L Galla chinensis. During the experiment, the dynamic changes of pH were recorded. After 6 pulses, surface structure of the biofilm was observed with a scanning electron microscope and the population on the biofilm was enumerated. RESULTS: Galla chinesis significantly inhibited the adherence of Actinomyces naelundii to HA disc compared with the control group and facilitated the removal of acid products. It was also found that the extra-cellular polysaccharide was reduced with the pulsing of Galla chinesis. CONCLUSION: Galla chinesis in the biofilm model can partially reduce the cario-genic response of sucrose solution.
TI  - Non-contact removal of coadhering and non-coadhering bacterial pairs from pellicle surfaces by sonic brushing and de novo adhesion.
AB  - Coadhesion between oral microbial pairs is an established factor in the spatiotemporal development and prevalence of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque in vivo. This study compares removal and de novo adhesion of pairs of coadhering and non-coadhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by sonic brushing on salivary pellicles in a non-contact mode as a function of the distance between the brush and the pellicle surface in vitro. First, actinomycetes were adhered to a pellicle surface, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were allowed to adhere. Removal was examined by non-contact, sonic brushing with a wetted brush on a either a wetted or a substratum immersed to a depth of 7 mm. After brushing, de novo adhesion of streptococci to brushed pellicles was studied. For coadhering and non-coadhering pairs, 34% and 9%, respectively, of the adhering bacteria were involved in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. Non-contact, sonic brushing removed up to 99% of the adhering bacteria, regardless of the state of immersion of the substratum. Bacterial removal decreased with increasing distance of up to 6 mm between brush and pellicle surface. For the non-coadhering pair, subsequent exposure of pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded about 6% of bacteria involved in large aggregates. Alternatively, de novo adhesion of the coadhering streptococcal strain to pellicles brushed on the wetted substratum yielded 31% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, but after brushing the immersed substratum only 12% of the adhering bacteria were found in large aggregates. It is concluded that non-contact sonic brushing, under immersion, removes high percentage of adhering bacterial pairs up to a distance of 6 mm between the brush and the pellicle surface. However, non-contact, sonic brushing with only a thin wet film on the substratum may leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). MIC90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for Actinomyces spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for Prevotella spp. Isolates of Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Veillonella had the lowest MICs and MBCs, and isolates of Streptococcus, Fusobacterium and Lactobacillus had the highest. Time kill studies with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s, and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. These studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.
TI  - A rapid procedure to ascertain the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations.
AB  - A rapid method examining the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations with alamar blue, an oxidation-reduction dye with fluorescent end-points, is described. Significant correlations between increasing viable plate counts of the oral bacteria Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and increased alamar fluorescence were noted. Metabolically active bacteria reduced alamar with the reduced dye found in the cell-free filtrate. Insignificant alamar reductions were noted in the absence of bacteria or by spent culture supernatants. The efficacy of mouthrinses with clinically proven antiplaque agents such as chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride were determined by alamar blue. In a model system with A. viscosus, triclosan dentifrices demonstrate a dose-dependent effect on bacteria. Human salivary bacteria demonstrate increasing alamar fluorescence with increasing plate counts. A clinical study examined the effects of rinsing with chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses in comparison with a placebo mouthrinse and water on salivary bacteria. Rinsing with chlorhexidine resulted in the least number of bacteria by alamar and plate count methods. In summary, the current study demonstrates the utility of alamar blue to examine the antimicrobial effects of oral care formulations in laboratory and clinical studies.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - Enthalpy of interaction between coaggregating and non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a microcalorimetric study.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion and coaggregation are involved in the development of oral biofilms, called dental plaque. Although various techniques have already been used to study different aspects of these bacterial interactions, microcalorimetry has not yet been applied. This paper describes how isothermal reaction calorimetry can be employed to determine the enthalpy of coaggregation between two oral bacterial pairs. For most biological processes, the enthalpy tends to reach a minimum value, reflecting the most stable state, which is directly related to the heat content of the system. The calorimeter consists of four measuring units where reaction ampoules are filled with 1.5 ml of an Actinomyces naeslundii 147 suspension, while reference ampoules are filled with buffer only. After equilibration at 25 degrees C, 80 microl of a streptococcal suspension was titrated into the reaction ampoules. To study possible saturation of the binding sites on the actinomyces surface, three consecutive injections with streptococcal suspensions were done. Following each injection, a 20-microl aliquot was taken from the ampoule kept outside the calorimeter and the number of free (S(f)) and bound (S(b)) streptococci was determined microscopically. Experiments were carried out with a coaggregating streptococcal strain (Streptococcus oralis J22) and a non-coaggregating strain (Streptococcus sanguis PK1889), serving as a control. The coaggregation enthalpy was exothermic, that is, heat was released in the reaction ampoule upon coaggregation and the heat released by the coaggregating pair minus the heat released by the non-coaggregating pair yielded a coaggregation enthalpy of -0.015 x 10(-6) mJ/bound streptococcus for the first injection. Upon consecutive injections, the coaggregation enthalpy decreased to -0.0004 x 10(-6) mJ/bound streptococcus. Comparison with enthalpy changes reported for lectin-carbohydrate binding suggests that a huge number of binding sites are involved in the formation of one bacterial coaggregate.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - PCR method is essential for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
AB  - Tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by Mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. M. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. To evaluate the risk of M. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of M. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The detection rates by PCR in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. The detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. M. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. Strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of M. tuberculosis, but strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. The present study concludes that the PCR method is essential for detecting M. tuberculosis in oral samples.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of zirconia ceramic surfaces: an in vitro and in vivo study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The microbial colonization of new ceramic materials developed for abutment manufacturing was assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used in these experiments were disks of 'as-fired' and 'rectified' ceramic material made of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals stabilized with yttrium (Y-TZP) and commercially pure grade 2 titanium (Ti) with corresponding eluates. They were tested in vitro with the following bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Proliferation was evaluated on plates by inhibitory halos around pits, previously inoculated with eluates obtained from the materials. Bacterial adhesion on materials was quantified by spectrophotometric evaluation of the slime production by the same bacteria. Moreover, early bacterial adhesion was evaluated in human volunteers and observed with SEM. RESULTS: No inhibition of bacterial proliferation using eluates was observed. In vitro as-fired and rectified Y-TZP showed significantly more adherent S. mutans than did Ti disks, while S. sanguis seemed to adhere easily to Ti specimens. No differences were noted for Actinomyces spp and P. gingivalis. In vivo Y-TZP accumulated fewer bacteria than Ti in terms of the total number of bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods. No differences were observed between rectified and as-fired Y-TZP. DISCUSSION: Overall, Y-TZP accumulates fewer bacteria than Ti. CONCLUSION: Y-TZP may be considered as a promising material for abutment manufacturing.
TI  - Influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  - The influence of secondary colonizers (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs coated with Streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3H-labeled bacterial cell suspension of F. nucleatum or A. naeslundii and then in a 14C-labeled P. gingivalis cell suspension. Bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. The cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of P. gingivalis. These two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of P. gingivalis. Human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of P. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to S. sanguis-coated HAP discs. Adherence of P. gingivalis and A. naeslundii was strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of F. nucleatum was affected the least. Treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of P. gingivalis. The rate of decrease was much smaller in F. nucleatum. These results indicate that both F. nucleatum and A. naeslundii enhance the adherence of P. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of P. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.
TI  - [The study of precedent subgingival flora colonization on four kinds of crown and bridge restorative materials].
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effects of microbial colonization on different crown or fixed bridge-used restorative materials and discuss the standards for evaluating those materials microscopically. Four kinds of restorative materials such as SDA-II type medium alloy, ceramic-fused-to-metal material, heat cure composite resin for crown restoration, Plat castable ceramics and four species of precedent subgingival flora (A. viscosus, F. nucleterm, C. ochracea, S. sanguis) were used. The material specimen had been continuously anaerobic cultured with the experimental bacterial fluid for 3, 7 and 14 days respectively, then the OD values of the specimenwashing fluid which could stand for the biomass of colonized bacteria on the surfaces of materials were measured. The results indicated that the quantity of precedent subgingival flora colonization on the surfaces of different restorative materials varied among different species of bacteria, which might concern with the surface structure, composition, property of anticorrosion and antisoluability of those materials.
TI  - Effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  - Antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. Previous studies suggested that 1 mM NaF reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. The present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mM, 10 ppm NaF) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. Nine oral species were grown at pH 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the pH for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of NaF. In addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without NaF, and the pH change followed by microelectrode. After 10 days, chemostat pH dropped to ca. pH 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by Streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total CFU) and Veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). In comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final pH was significantly higher (ca. pH 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). The culture was predominated by V. dispar (70%) and Actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas S. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. Biofilm pH fell to only pH 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). Analysis of the data suggests that fluoride exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. Fluoride prevents enrichment of S. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the antimicrobial action of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan with a lipid-depleting detergent-based handwash product with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate. The zones of inhibition produced by the two handwash lotions and the one produced by the positive control were similar against all strains of bacteria tested, indicating that a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan is as effective as a lipid-depleting handwash lotion in inhibiting bacterial activity.
TI  - Actinomyces species, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Actinomyces species,  streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. Samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples. All root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, Actinomyces species in 9.4%, and E. faecalis in 7.5%. The most prevalent species were members of the Streptococcus anginosus group. With regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most prevalent species were S. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), E. faecalis (11.5%), and S. anginosus (7.7%). S. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). The other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were A. gerencseriae (14.8%), S. gordonii (11.1%), S. intermedius (11.1%), A. israelii (7.4%), S. anginosus (7.4%), and S. sanguis (7.4%). S. constellatus was the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of indigenous Indians of Central America.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous Indians in Guatemala, Central America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. Plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. RESULTS: Plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. At the subject level, Actinomyces naeslundii and Peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. CONCLUSION: There was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. These latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. However, in this population where extensive plaque deposits and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  - Although substantial epidemiologic evidence links Streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. Molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ECC) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. Cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNAs from a healthy subject and a subject with ECC were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. Ten novel phylotypes were identified. A number of species or phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant further investigation. In addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. Significant differences were observed for nine species: S. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Bifidobacterium, S. mutans, Veillonella, S. salivarius, S. constellatus, S. parasanguinis, and Lactobacillus fermentum were associated with caries. These data suggest that A. gerencseriae and other Actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel Bifidobacterium may be a major pathogen in deep caries. Further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.
TI  - The predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  - The predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (pH 5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. Streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. The proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. Actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque samples. The proportions of Candida albicans, Lactobacillus spp. and Veillonella spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. The most frequently isolated lactobacilli were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The predominant aciduric flora was S. oralis, S. mutans and A. israelii and these taxa were also isolated from a similar proportion of the lesions at pH 7.0. Strains of S. mutans, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were genotyped using PCR-based methods. Each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. These data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.
TI  - Association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using the colorimetric PerioGard (PTM) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (EOP). In each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (PD >5 mm) randomly chosen in each quadrant. Bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Clinical measurements as well as AST activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the PTM, were recorded at the same sites. RESULTS: Sixty-two sites exhibited AST positive and 38 AST negative activity. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann Whitney U-test) showed that Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides forsythus, Camplobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus and Selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with AST-positive activity. The odds ratio of having high prevalence of S. intermedius, P. micros, C. concisus, B. forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus and S. sputigena in the presence of a positive AST site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemella morbillorum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium varium, Eubacterium lentum and Prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with AST negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of AST positive sites. The logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with AST activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of AST activity. The co-infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. micros, or P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and C. rectus were found to be significantly associated with the AST activity (p<0.001). AST positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. sputigena or by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. intermedius than AST negative sites (p<0.001). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the AST negative sites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive AST scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Co-adhesion and removal of adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by three different modes of brushing.
AB  - This study compares removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by hand, electric and sonic brushing from salivary pellicles. In addition, re-deposition of a co-adhering and non-co-adhering streptococcal strain to brushed pellicles was studied. First, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 C. Pellicles with adhering bacterial pairs were brushed and the number of bacteria remaining determined. Whereas sonic brushing removed nearly all adhering bacteria, greater numbers of larger aggregates of the co-adhering pair, involving Streptococcus oralis J22, were left behind after hand and electric brushing than of the non-co-adhering pair with Streptococcus sanguis PK1889. Re-deposition of streptococci to electrically and sonically brushed pellicles, however, was two-fold higher for the co-adhering pair than for the non-co-adhering pair. This demonstrates a role for co-adhesion in de novo plaque formation. Removal by the three different modes of brushing was not affected by the presence of fluoride, indicating that fluoride is not able to disrupt calcium bridges between co-adhering pairs. In contrast, in the presence of lactose only small aggregates of co-adhering pair were left behind.
TI  - Proteolytic degradation of oral biofilms in vitro and in vivo: potential of proteases originating from Euphausia superba for plaque control.
AB  - This paper deals with enzymatic removal of dental plaque, in vitro as well as in  vivo, using proteases from the Antarctic krill shrimp (Euphausia superba), referred to as Krillase. Krillase exhibits both endo- and exopeptidase activity but has no microbicidal effect. In model systems with pure cultures of oral microorganisms. Krillase demonstrated inhibition of microbial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, a protocol for the growth of reproducible in vitro plaque films has been developed, and effects of Krillase on the plaque film were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that Krillase efficiently released microorganisms from plaque in vitro, the effect being dependent on the enzymatic activity. The surface energy of the substratum had a minor influence on the formation and removal of plaque in vitro. Ellipsometric studies on the formation and enzymatic removal of a salivary pellicle indicated that the enzymatic effect on plaque may partly depend on degradation of the salivary pellicle. Krillase was also able to remove plaque accumulated on dentures in vivo. Our results demonstrate the potential of Krillase for plaque control, and that these enzymes are worthy of further investigations including clinical studies and work to find a suitable vehicle.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  - Antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (PC) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. Previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain PC as determined by reactivity with PC-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (IgG) G anti-PC are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. These data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-PC responses. Recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for PC are elevated in ApoE-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (oxLDL) in atherosclerotic plaques. These data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-PC could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxLDL, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. We therefore examined the ability of human anti-PC to bind to PC-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-PC to PC-bearing Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Our results indicated that PC-bearing strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed up to 80% of anti-PC IgG antibody from human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound to a PC-bearing strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a PC-negative strain. OxLDL also absorbed anti-PC from human sera, and oxLDL but not LDL reacted with up to 80% of the anti-PC in human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound directly to oxLDL but not to LDL. The data indicate that PC-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxLDL. We propose that PC-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to PC that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.
TI  - Actinomyces naeslundii fimbrial protein Orf977 shows similarity to a streptococcal adhesin.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the chromosomal DNA, upstream of Actinomyces naeslundii T14V fimbrial gene fimA, was determined. One open reading frame (orf977) encoding 977 amino acids was found, preceded by a gene homologous to elongation factor TU. Database searches revealed that Orf977 was homologous to CshA, a Streptococcus gordonii protein involved in cell adhesion. Previous studies had already determined two genes in the type 2 fimbrial gene cluster of A. naeslundii T14V: the structural subunit fimA, and orf365 with unknown function, followed by ribosomal genes. This study completes the type 2 fimbrial gene cluster sequence.
TI  - Alteration of the coadherence of Candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  - Interactions between bacterial oral flora and Candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. This study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of C. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. The second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. When yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (YNB) supplemented with 250 mM glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of Streptoccus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. However, when the yeast was precultured in YNB supplemented with 500 mM galactose, the yeast coadhered with S. salivarius and Actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in YNB with glucose. In addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of S. sanguis was significantly reduced. Enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.
TI  - Bacterial detachment from salivary conditioning films by dentifrice supernates.
AB  - This study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. Ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. Following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans or Actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. Then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. Finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. On average, S. sanguis was the easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while A. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). The combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. Dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. Factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including pH, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  - Particulate Bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. This material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. The aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (NB), artificial saliva (AS) or Dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (DMEM + 10%FCS), with or without particulate Bioglass. All bacteria showed reduced viability following exposure to Bioglass in all the media after 1 h. This antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in either BM broth or 40% horse serum (HS) in RPMI. A considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. In further experiments it was found that the viability of S. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to NB pre-incubated with Bioglass. Additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. Moreover, a solution of NB and NaOH (of equivalent pH) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with Bioglass. Thus, particulate Bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. This may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.
TI  - Effects of three different infant dentifrices on biofilms and oral microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of infant dentifrices: A--with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and lactoferrin; B--with 1100 ppm of NaF and sodium lauryl sulfate; C--with extract of calendula. The dentifrices were test on biofilms formed in vitro from saliva and dental plaque of infants, using reference strains A. viscosus (ATCC 43146); C. albicans (ATCC 51501); L. casei (ATCC 4646); S. mitis (ATCC 49456); S. mutans (ATCC 25175); S. oralis (ATCC 35037); S. sanguis (ATCC 10586); S. sobrinus (ATCC 27609) and isolated clinically microorganisms C. albicans, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus and Lactobacillus sp. Twenty infants were chosen, who were beginning treatment at the Infants Clinic of the Pediatric Dentistry Department, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A pool of unstimulated saliva and a pool of dental plaque were collected from which biofilms were produced. Supernatants from each dentifrice were prepared and concentrated and diluted solutions of the dentifrices and a control sterile diluent were tested against the biofilms produced, for 1 and 3 minutes, and against the microorganisms. The results were statistically analyzed by the ANOVA and Tukey Test. After the exposure of the biofilms produced both from saliva and from dental plaque, to the dentifrice B concentrated and 1/2, for 1 and 3 minutes, the viable microorganisms count (CFU/ml), compared to the controls, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). However, exposure to the dentifrices A and C concentrated and dentifrice B 1/4 and 1/8, for 1 and 3 minutes, was not significantly lethal to the biofilms. The dentifrices A and C, either concentrated or diluted (1/2 to 1/128) and the dentifrice B in the dilutions 1/16 to 1/128 did not have an antimicrobial effect on any microorganism evaluated. For all the microorganisms evaluated, the dentifrice B concentrated and in the 1/2 dilution showed a significant antimicrobial effect, when compared with the control (p < 0.05).
TI  - Addition of antibacterial agents to MMA-TBB dentin bonding systems--influence on  tensile bond strength and antibacterial effect.
AB  - To produce a bonding system which has both high bond strength and antibacterial properties, an antibacterial agent (vancomycin: VCM or metronidazol: MN) was added to the PMMA powder of 4-META/MMA-TBB resin (CB). The influence of the addition of an antibacterial agent on tensile bond strength to dentin and the antibacterial effect were investigated in this study. Forty-seven freshly extracted bovine first or second incisors were used to measure the tensile bond strength to dentin. The bond strengths to bovine dentin were not significantly decreased by addition of VCM (1%, 2%, 5%), or MN (1%) to CB (p < 0.05). The antibacterial effect of CB containing antibacterial agent on six strains of bacteria was investigated by the agar plate diffusion method, analyzing the appearance of the inhibition zone around a resin disk following anaerobic culturing. The resin disks containing VCM showed antibacterial effects on all of the strains examined; the widths of the inhibition zones were 4-15 mm. The resin disks containing MN showed antibacterial effects on three strains; the widths of the inhibition zones were 0-4 mm. It was thus possible to produce a bonding system with both antibacterial effect and high tensile bond strength by addition of VCM to PMMA powder.
TI  - [Effects of sodium doecyl sulfate on the artificial dental plaque in chemostat].
AB  - Sodium doecyl sulfate (SDS) is widely used as a detergent in dentifrices. It has  been shown to interfere with the protein adsorption to hydroxyapatite (HA), and inhibit acquired pellicle formation. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of SDS on the artificial dental plaque in chemostat. The amount of the 3H-labelled bacteria adhered on the enamel fragment surface was determined with scintillometer. The artificial dental plaque was observed under the scanning electron microscope. The results showed that enamel fragments treated with SDS adsorbed less bacteria than untreated ones, and had no plague formed. It suggested that SDS can inhibit the bacterial adherence on enamel surface and thus reduce dental plaque formation.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Properties of Streptococcus sanguinis glucans formed under various conditions.
AB  - The aim of our study was to determine whether the structure of glucans formed by  glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus sanguinis (GtfSs) on a surface differ from those formed in solution and to explore the effects of antiserum to Gtfs, control normal rabbit serum, starch hydrolysates (STH) and dextran on S. sanguinis (GtfSs) glucan. Linkage analyses showed that solution-formed glucans are predominantly alpha-1,6-linked and have a small amount of alpha-1,3-linked glucose. Surface-formed glucans have enhanced susceptibility to mutanase. Solution- and surface-formed glucans made in the presence or absence of sera, STH, and dextran contain linkages which differ in both amount and type from control glucans. The GtfSs enzyme in solution exposed to antiserum behaves as if it is adsorbed to a surface. Binding of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E (Ny1) to S. sanguinis glucan differs if the glucan is formed in the presence of antiserum. The information could help to define the role of glucans in the formation of pellicle, colonization of tooth surfaces and the accumulation of dental plaque.
TI  - Fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. METHODS: The antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. Two organisms each belonging to Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. A checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) and summation operator FIC index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. Appropriate controls were included. The summation operator FIC index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. RESULTS: The data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. Using summation operator FIC values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by The American Society for Microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. However, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. Nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. CONCLUSIONS: According to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. However, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.
TI  - Sensitization of Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguis in biofilms and suspensions to acid damage by fluoride and other weak acids.
AB  - Fluoride and other weak acids, such as benzoate, indomethacin, salicylate and sorbate, were found to be sensitizers for acid killing of cells of Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 19246 and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 in suspensions or in mono-organism biofilms on glass slides. These bacteria are among the more acid-sensitive organisms from dental plaque and were killed when acidified to pH values between 3.5 and 4.0. Biofilm cells were more resistant than cells in suspensions, especially in terms of the fraction of the initial population surviving acidification. The mechanism for sensitization to acid killing by fluoride and the other weak acids involved enhanced transmembrane transport of protons, reflected by increases in measured proton permeabilities of the cells. Thus, the weak acids thwarted the functions of F(H+)-ATPases in extruding protons and protecting cells against acid damage. Fluoride sensitization of biofilms or cells in suspensions to acid damage occurred rapidly. There was a delay in sensitization of biofilms by indomethacin and higher molecular weight acids which was interpreted in terms of diffusion limitation of sensitizer penetration. Overall, it seemed that weak-acid sensitization to acid killing is a general phenomenon that occurs not just for oral bacteria but also for organisms in food, soil, and other acidified environments.
TI  - Automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  - The present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. Following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. Test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. Due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. Automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. Results are shown for six taxa (Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia/Prev. nigrescens, Streptococcus gordonii/Strep. oralis/Strep. sanguis, Strep. sobrinus, and Veillonella dispar/ V. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. Results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. This work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Studies concerning the glucosyltransferase of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - We have shown in previous studies that the glucosyltransferase (Gtf) enzymes of Streptococcus mutans have distinct properties when adsorbed to a surface. In the present study, we compared the activity of Gtf from Streptococcus sanguis, designated GtfSs, in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) beads, and determined the ability of its product glucan to support the adherence of oral microorganisms. Gtf from S. sanguis 804 NCTC 10904 was purified from culture supernatant fluids by means of hydroxyapatite chromatography. Enzyme and the substrate were prepared in buffers at pH values from 3.5 to 7.5. Maximum activity of GtfSs occurred between pH 5.5 and pH 6.5, whether in solution or adsorbed onto a surface. The solubilized and insolubilized enzymes showed highest activity at 40 degrees C; activity was reduced by 50(+/-2)% at 20 and 30 degrees C. The enzyme did not form glucans in either phase at 10 or 60 degrees C. The K(m), determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots, for the enzyme in solution was 4.3(+/-0.4) mmol/l sucrose, and the K(m) for the enzyme on sHA beads was 5.0(+/-1.0) mmol/l sucrose. The ability of the GtfSs glucan synthesized on the surface of sHA beads to support the adherence of oral bacteria was investigated. (3)H-thymidine-labeled bacteria (S. mutans GS-5, S. sobrinus 6715, S. sobrinus 6716, S. sanguis 10904, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, A. viscosus 2085, and A. viscosus 2086) were incubated with sHA beads coated with GtfSs glucan. S. mutans GS-5 displayed the highest level of binding numerically. These results show that the GtfSs of S. sanguis is active on sHA beads, that the pH optimum for activity on a surface differs slightly from that in solution, and that its product glucan can support the adherence of oral microorganisms.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Co-aggregation as a virulent factor of Streptococcus sanguis isolated from infective endocarditis.
AB  - The pathogenicity of strains of the Streptococcus sanguis group, isolated from infective endcarditis, was studied by measuring the development of subcutaneous abscesses in mice after infection with S. sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus either singly or as co-aggregated pairs. The pathogenicity of the co-aggregates was also examined in various viable combinations of the two bacterial species. More abscesses were formed by A. viscosus than the S. sanguis group including clinical isolates. Abscess formation by co-aggregates of combinations of each isolate and A. viscosus produced a higher percentage of abscess formation than those caused by infection with a pure suspension of A. viscosus or tested streptococci. Co-aggregated cells were more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils in vivo. These results indicated that S. sanguis group streptococci isolated from infective endocarditis are able to co-aggregate and resist phagocytosis. The ability of co-aggregation of S. sanguis may serve as a survival mechanism in a host defense system and may be linked with virulence of this bacteria.
TI  - Periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in Behcet's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. Recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with Behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. Plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. Serum IgG antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. RESULTS: Significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with Behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (P <0.0001). Antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with Behcet's disease than in controls (P <0.001-0.05). In contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 compared to controls (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with Behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. Decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in Behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (II). Effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). Saliva samples as well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. All subjects received full mouth SRP and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. Saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Control subjects were sampled at the same time points. Samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in PRAS Ringer's solution and plated on enriched Trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. Microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the Mann Whitney test and over time within each group using the Quade test. The mean % (+/-SEM) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to 25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. In saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. The % of resistant isolates did not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. For all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus gordonii, Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. Doxycycline resistant strains of these species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. Despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - Automatic enumeration of adherent streptococci or actinomyces on dental alloy by  fluorescence image analysis.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop an automated image analysis method to quantify adherence of Streptococcus sanguinis or Actinomyces viscosus on surfaces of a currently used dental alloy. Counting such bacterial strains was difficult because of their arrangement, thus S. sanguinis being a coccus arranged in chains or pairs, and A. viscosus a long complexly arranged polymorph rod. Direct counting of fluorescently stained adherent bacteria was done visually and with image analysis methods. To differentiate these two morphotypes, two programs were developed: (i) for streptococci, thresholding and selection of the object maxima, and (ii) for actinomyces, two step thresholding and processing of the characteristic points of the object skeletons. The triplicate enumerations for each bacterial strain were not significantly different (p > 0.005) and correlations between visual counting and automated counting were significant (r = 0.91 for S. sanguinis and r = 0.99 for A. viscosus, p <00.0001). These rapid and reproducible methods, allowed us to count either cocci or rods, adherent on an inert substratum, in high density conditions.
TI  - An in vitro investigation of the antimicrobial activity of an herbal mouthrinse.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of one prescription and two commercially available over-the-counter mouthrinses and positive and negative controls against bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity. The bacteria used in this study were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. Sterile discs which were treated with the mouthrinses were placed on agar plates along with the controls. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. The results indicated that all of the mouthrinses demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested. Herbal Mouth and Gum Therapy mouthrinse, containing natural ingredients, produced the largest zones of microbial inhibition when compared to Listerine against all three of the bacteria tested. Herbal Mouth and Gum Therapy mouthrinse produced larger zones of microbial inhibition when compared to Peridex against two of the three bacteria tested, and produced similar zones of inhibition against the third bacteria.
TI  - Adhesion and surface-aggregation of Candida albicans from saliva on acrylic surfaces with adhering bacteria as studied in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  - Adhesive interactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria are generally thought to play a crucial role in the microbial colonization of denture acrylic, which may lead to denture stomatitis. This study investigated the influence of saliva on the adhesive interactions between C. albicans and Streptococcus sanguis or Actinomyces naeslundii on denture acrylic. First, bacteria were allowed to adhere to the acrylic surface from a flowing suspension, and subsequently yeasts were flowed over the acrylic surface. The organisms were assayed in the presence or absence of human whole saliva. All experiments were carried out in a parallel plate flow chamber and enumeration was done in situ with an image analysis system. In the absence of adhering bacteria, adhesion of C. albicans from buffer was more extensive than from saliva. However, in the presence of adhering bacteria, yeast adhesion from saliva was increased with respect to adhesion of yeasts from buffer, indicating that specific salivary components constitute a bridge between bacteria and yeasts. In all cases, yeast aggregates consisting of 3 to 5 yeast cells were observed adhering to the surface. A surface physico-chemical analysis of the microbial cell surfaces prior to and after bathing the microorganisms in saliva, suggests that this bridging is mediated by acid-base interactions since all strains show a major increase in electron-donating surface free energy parameters upon bathing in saliva, with no change in their zeta potentials. The surface physico-chemical analysis furthermore suggests that S. sanguis and A. naeslundii may use a different mechanism for adhesive interactions with C. albicans in saliva.
TI  - Polymicrobial etiology of dental caries.
AB  - The present study was carried out to establish the normal bacterial oral flora and the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora from deep seated dental caries, and to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity of the clinical isolates so obtained Streptococcus mutans (48%) and Streptococcus sanguis (20%) were the main aerobic isolates whereas Lactobacillus spp. (52%), Veillonella spp. (24%) and Actinomyces spp. (12%) were the major anaerobic isolates. Hundred percent of the samples from dental caries yielded polymicrobial isolates while in two samples from healthy individuals S. mutans was the sole isolate. As the flora changed from healthy tooth to dental caries it changed from one predominated by anaerobic gram-positive cocci to anaerobic gram-positive bacilli. All the anaerobes isolated were sensitive to metronidazole and cefotaxime, whereas all the isolated streptococci were sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Incorporation of the antibiotics in baseline restoration, if technically feasible, has been advocated.
TI  - The effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  - Susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. We investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. In a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a continuous culture system comprised of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. Ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/mL of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic Gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. Ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. For ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. In both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). Although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.
TI  - Cell wall-anchored CshA polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in Streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  - It has been shown previously that inactivation of the cshA gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kDa) in the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii, generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral Actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. We now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type S. gordonii DL1 (Challis) cells, bind CshA-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of cshA mutants. To more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of CshA, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire cshA gene into the replicative plasmid pAM401 and expressed full-length CshA polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. Enterococci expressing CshA exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell surface hydrophobicity over E. faecalis JH2-2 carrying the pAM401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. CshA expression in E. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind Actinomyces naeslundii cells. Electron micrographs of negatively stained E. faecalis cells expressing CshA showed peritrichous surface fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control E. faecalis JH2-2(pAM401) cells. The fibrils bound CshA-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of E. faecalis cells to fibronectin. The results demonstrate that the CshA polypeptide is the structural and functional component of S. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.
TI  - The importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  - Cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization of various oral bacterial species. Bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. The properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance. Among others, Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. The fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kDa fimbrillin proteins. DNA sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fimA) from nine strains of P. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fimA, while retaining common immunochemical specificities. P. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. Fimbriae of Prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of Prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., Actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. Fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral Actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. These fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. Taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of the Bactericidal Activity on Oral Organisms of the Nd-YAP Laser In  Vitro.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of a pulsed fibre-optic Nd-YAP laser on various strains of oral bacteria: Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus (i), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Peptostreptococcus micros (i) was evaluated. A 200-mum optical fibre was placed in Eppendorf tubes containing the different bacterial suspensions. At an energy of 170 mJ/30 Hz, 351 pulses of 150 mus were sufficient to kill the most resistant bacteria (i). The exposure time was 28 s. The temperature rise caused by the shots were measured in vitro at the surface of the roots of two groups of 10 single-rooted teeth. One group received 350 pulses; for the other the preparation time was fixed at 28 s. The temperature rose by 25.66 degrees C for the first group and 25.25 degrees C for the second.
TI  - Bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. Artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. The reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1 mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (Actinomyces israelii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis). Bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. Ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% NaOCl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (P < 0.0001), whilst 12% NaOCl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. Ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% EDTA-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl killed A. israelii, F. nucleatum, P. acnes, S. mutans, and S. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for F. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in five samples out of 12. Ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated NaOCl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.
TI  - Acid-regulated proteins induced by Streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  - Our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal pH values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low pH (pH 3.0-4.0) that kills unadapted control cells maintained at pH 7.5 (Oral Microbiol Immunol 1997: 12: 266-273). In this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low pH. For this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from pH 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14C]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. The cells were extracted for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. Of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in pH homeostasis. Streptococcus mutans LT11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. The enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kDa. Within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane H+/ATPase. By comparison, the strong responder, Lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. Streptococcus salivarius AT2 and Streptococcus gordonii TH12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10,556 and Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. Even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low pH, such as Streptococcus sobrinus CH125/43, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 12,261 and Actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. Clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low pH is related, not to the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal pH homeostasis.
TI  - Oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  - Candida albicans (Ca), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces naeslundii (An), Actinomyces odontolyticus (Ao), Porphyromona spp (P spp), Candida glabrata (Cg), Candida krusei (Ck), and Rhodotorula spp (R spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. Membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 mL homologous suspension for each strain under study. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. Macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. Membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. Samples were sonicated, and the supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. Incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to Log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. Orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. Highest adhesion was found with Ca, Cg, Ck, Sa, and Ss. A sufficient quantity of Actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. Results with P spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. Replicate flasks with Ss and Ca were cultivated. Membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control pieces. A cavelike surface was observed. Streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. Candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity produced by six dentifrices.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of six commercially available dentifrices and positive and negative controls as they come into contact with Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, and Actinomyces viscosus commonly found in the oral cavity. Sterile discs treated with the dentifrices were placed on agar plates with the controls. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. All of the test dentifrices demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. Bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. In an aqueous environment, Ca2+, Na+, PO4(3-) , and Si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in pH and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. Since these are factors that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass S53P4 on the oral microorganisms Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. This was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass S53P4 in powder form. A. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within 10 min under the experimental conditions. A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and S. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. Also for S. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. Thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass S53P4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. Consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  - This investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. Differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Commonly detected species, such as Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. Mean % of sites (+/-SEM) colonized by Bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. The odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when B. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. Mean prevalence for Porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for Treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2 (p<0.001) and for Selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). Similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with PD 0-4 mm were analyzed. The data suggest an etiologic role for B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, T. denticola and S. noxia in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Time-dependent interfacial tension of whole saliva and saliva-bacteria mixes.
AB  - Using a tensiometer in accordance with the drop volume principle, the surface tension decrease with time was determined for whole and for 2%, 10%, and 50% aqueous solutions of saliva from one healthy donor. The reduction of surface tension with time was also measured for 10% and 20% saliva solutions with added samples of Streptococcus salivarius KRF2, S. sanguis KRF3, and Actinomyces naeslundii 2t-55. The results show that 1) there is a time dependence of the surface tension reduction of both whole saliva and diluted saliva, 2) an increase of the concentration of whole saliva in salivary solutions gives rise to larger and more rapid surface tension reduction, 3) the proteinaceous components of saliva appear to have a dominant contribution on surface tension in whole saliva and diluted saliva, and 4) the surface-active proteinaceous components in saliva have the ability to dominate the air-saliva interface also in the presence of high concentrations of salivary bacteria.
TI  - Anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  - Reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. As expected, the cations Fe2+ and Cu+ enhanced killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 by hydroperoxides. However, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to O2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. Sensitivities to anaerobic killing by Fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. The oral streptococci Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus rattus FA-1, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 were approximately as sensitive as S. mutans GS-5. Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, and Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45 had intermediate sensitivity, while Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 and Escherichia coli B were insensitive. Killing of S. mutans GS-5 in response to millimolar levels of added Fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and pH. The organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. Chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. Sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to Fe2+ exposure. Fe2+, but not Fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of S. mutans. The reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to Fe2+ inhibition of F-ATPase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or F1 enzyme separated from membranes. Cu+ and Cu2+ also inhibited F-ATPase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. All of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.
TI  - Comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern Cameroon.
AB  - Our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult Cameronians. The aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched Cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction. We also compared cultivation and the Affirm DP test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined and the results were compared statistically. Each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. Results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of the 18 bacterial species. The Gram-positive species Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. Cultivation demonstrated P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared to the checkerboard technique. Furthermore, the Affirm DP test detected P. gingivalis and B. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the Affirm DP test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. Overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the healthy and diseased adult Cameronians were similar to those reported for adults in the West and in some developing countries.
TI  - Structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  - Lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. The presence of two host-like motifs, either GalNAc beta1-->3Gal (Gn) or Gal beta1-->3GalNAc (G), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with Actinomyces naeslundii. Three streptococcal strains which have Gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in GalNAc-sensitive coaggregations with strains of Streptococcus gordonii and S. sanguis. Each Gn- or G-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. The occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations with actinomyces was examined. Negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with Bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a Gal and GalNAc binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. Results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known Gn- or G-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related Gn-containing type. Unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. Gn-containing polysaccharides occurred primarily on the strains of S. sanguis and S. oralis while G-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of S. gordonii and S. mitis examined. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse Gn- and G-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Adherence of oral streptococci to an immobilized antimicrobial agent.
AB  - An antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. Interaction between the material (termed) OAIS) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. Seven species of Streptococcus and two Actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. Cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. Analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to OAIS revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. The results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to OAIS. Gel electrophoresis revealed that OAIS could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. Preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the Strep. mutans strain to OAIS in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that OAIS adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. A major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.
TI  - A microbiological study of pre- and postoperative apicoectomy sites.
AB  - There is little information on the microbiology of periapical lesions, and no data on the residual microbial flora in the periapex, if any, after apicoectomy procedures. Hence, 64 patients treated by apicoectomy procedures were prospectively studied to assess the bacterial flora in the periapex and to evaluate the residual bacteria in postoperative apicoectomy sites. Of the 64 lesions studied, 14 (22%) were sterile and 50 (78%) yielded bacteria preoperatively. Bacteria could be recovered from 28 (56%) of the latter lesions after apicoectomy and curettage. A total of 105 bacterial strains was isolated from 50 lesions, yielding a range of 1-4 (mean 2.1) species per sample. The isolates comprised 84 (80%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (20%) strict anaerobes. A polymicrobial growth was obtained from 39 lesions whilst 11 lesions yielded pure cultures. On detailed microbiological analyses of 29 lesions, 40% of the isolates were identified as alpha-haemolytic streptococci, half of which were Streptococcus sanguis; anaerobic streptococci were the predominant anaerobes. None of the organisms or group(s) of organisms emerged as recalcitrant colonisers which were difficult to dislodge after surgical debridement. These data indicate that the majority of periapical lesions harbour a variety of flora which cannot be eradicated despite thorough apicoectomy procedures.
TI  - Inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  - Enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (Ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mM inorganic phosphate ions. In this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. The molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kDa. The Vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 IU/mg and K(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mM. Enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with Ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microM in the presence of 5 mM inorganic phosphate ions. Ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mM. The enolase from Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (Ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 10575 (Ki = 19 +/- 2) or Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 (Ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627 (Ki = 46 +/- 6) or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (Ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. The levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.
TI  - Variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  - The distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). Indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque to facilitate sampling. About 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (A), to the side of (S), and below (B) the contact area. Plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. An average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. Streptococcus and Actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. The predominant Actinomyces and streptococcal species at most subsites were A. naeslundii and Strep. mitis biovar I. A. naeslundii and A. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite B (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and A. israelii at subsite S (66.7%) Strep. mitis 1 and Strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite S (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas Strep mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Strep. gordonii and Veillonella spp. were recovered most commonly from subsite B (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). The isolation frequencies of Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite B (A B p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites B and S (A < B, p > 0.01; B > S, p < 0.05), while Neisseria spp. were most common at subsite A (A > B. p > 0.03). IgAl protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total Streptococcus population. This study has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. The population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area B.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - Saliva mediated adherence, aggregation and prevalence in dental plaque of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces spp, in young and elderly humans.
AB  - Salivary components in the pellicle mediate bacterial adherence to the tooth. Such components may also aggregate bacteria in saliva and prevent them becoming established in dental plaque. In the present study, the adherence and aggregation of Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt, S. sanguis strain 10556 and Actinomyces viscosus-strain 19246 mediated by parotid and whole saliva from groups of young and elderly people were examined. Significant differences were found between test strains, salivary secretions and age groups. S. sanguis 10556 and A. viscosus 19246 generally adhered more strongly than S. mutans Ingbritt, which adhered better to pellicles from parotid saliva than from whole saliva Strain 19246 bound in higher numbers to parotid saliva pellicles from elderly compared to young individuals. Strain 10556 adhered better to whole saliva than parotid saliva pellicles, and the difference was significant among the young individuals, indicating reduced adherence ability in elderly whole saliva. The streptococci were aggregated by parotid and whole saliva, and S. sanguis aggregation was less with whole saliva from the elderly than from the young participants. Besides a correlation between whole saliva aggregation of S. mutans and proportions of bacteria in plaque, no correlations were found for the individual binding properties of saliva and prevalence of bacteria in vivo. However, the level of saliva-mediated adherence in vitro was in the following order: S. mutans. Actinomyces S sanguis, which corresponded to their isolation frequency in plaque. These findings emphasize the importance of initial adherence to salivary receptors in bacterial colonization on teeth. Further studies are needed to reveal if individual patterns in the in vitro binding characteristics of saliva lead to variation of colonization in vivo.
TI  - Plaque pH and microflora of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces.
AB  - Given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced pH response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. Seventeen caries-active elderly Chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. Plaque pH was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. Plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious pH-measurement sites in each subject. The prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on Brucella agar: Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, Streptococcus spp., S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. There was no difference in plaque pH response on sound and carious root surfaces. The plaque pH response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites. There was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. The pH response to sucrose was the same regardless of the presence or absence of mutans streptococci. Our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.
TI  - Electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. Phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. The present experiment using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. Soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the root canal and blood. These included Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia. Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis. The electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. Furthermore, with this typing method the species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated. These species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. Also, differences between subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with SDS-PAGE, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. The electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Shear bond strength, microleakage and antimicrobial properties of AElitebond.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) and microleakage (ML) to dentin as well as the antimicrobial action against five strains of oral bacteria of AElitebond single primer restorative system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen molars were tested to failure for each of the four time periods: 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days, after final cure. The test specimens were prepared on the dentin surfaces of the extracted molars ground on 600 grit SiC paper. The bonded cylinders were removed from the assembly apparatus after cure, stored in physiological saline at 37 degrees C for the four different time periods and subjected to a shear bond load at 0.5 mm/minute until fractured. For the microleakage determination, Class V cavity preparations were done on the facial surfaces of the roots of 15 canines below the cemento-enamel junction and the specimens thermocycled (500x) between 8 degrees C and 15 degrees C in 2% methylene blue. The teeth were cut into 6 mm thick sections and the sections which included the restorations were separately dissolved in acid. The color intensities of the dissolved sections were measured at a wavelength of 590 nm against a standard curve which was constructed from the dye. The modified model cavity method of Meryon & Johnson (1989) was used to assess the antimicrobial properties of the restorative system. RESULTS: The mean SBS values (in MPa) were found to be 10.3, 9.8, 11.47 and 9.9 after 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. There was no significant increase (P < 5%) in the SBS after 15 minutes. The ML of 0.76 micrograms dye/ restoration was relatively low in comparison to the SBS values. The restorative system significantly (P < 5%) inhibited the growth of Actinomyces naeslundii with 88%, Streptococcus mutans with 42%, Streptococcus sanguis with 39% and Streptococcus oralis with 9%. However, the growth of Veillonella parvula was stimulated with 49%.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  - Thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. Clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate PD measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. Baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. Microbial samples were taken from 11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. Levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. Standard deviations of replicate PD measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. Plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with PD change. Baseline and follow-up distributions of PD changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. Five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. Sites from 2 subjects showed PD increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. Species associated with putative active subjects included Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Selenomonas noxia and Prevotella nigrescens. Streptococcus sanguis, S. gordonii and Peptostreptococcus micros were associated with inactive subjects. S. gordonii and S. oralis were associated with health, whereas P. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. Elevated serum antibodies were detected to A. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. The predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.
TI  - Co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs under flow in the presence of saliva and lactose.
AB  - Co-aggregation (interactions between two suspended micro-organisms) between oral  microbial pairs has been studied extensively and is believed to be an important factor in dental plaque formation. However, co-adhesion (interactions between suspended and already-adhering micro-organisms) may well be equally important. The aim of this paper was to determine the influence of saliva and lactose on the co-adhesion of streptococci (S. oralis 34 and S. sanguis PK1889) to actinomyces (A. naeslundii T14V-J1 or 5951) adhering on glass under flow from buffer and saliva in the absence and presence of lactose. The kinetics of co-adhesion as well as co-adhesion in a stationary end-point of co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber by analysis of the spatial arrangement of co-adhering micro-organisms as a function of time. For co-aggregating pairs, initial deposition rates of streptococci in the immediate vicinity of adhering actinomyces (local initial deposition rates) were up to 5 to 10 times higher than the non-local initial deposition rates in buffer and in saliva, respectively. In a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, 5 to 6 times more streptococci co-adhered with the adhering actinomyces than averaged over the entire substratum surface. A non-co-aggregating pair showed only minor preferential (co-)adhesion near the adhering actinomyces. Co-adhesion in buffer was fully lost when lactose was added. However, addition of lactose to saliva did not inhibit co-adhesion, but co-adhesion became more reversible. Detachment of micro-organisms from the substratum due to the passage of an air-liquid interface, as occurs in the oral cavity during eating, drinking, and speaking, was minimal when deposition was carried out from buffer to bare glass. Major detachment of streptococci adhering to the substratum occurred when adhesion was mediated through a salivary conditioning film on the glass, while detachment of adhering actinomyces and streptococci co-adhering with them remained low. It is suggested that, in the development of dental plaque, adhering actinomyces may act as strongholds for other micro-organisms, like streptococci, to adhere.
TI  - Adherence, accumulation, and cell division of a natural adherent bacterial population.
AB  - Developing dental bacterial plaques formed in vivo on enamel surfaces were examined in specimens from 18 adult volunteers during the first day of plaque formation. An intraoral model placing enamel pieces onto teeth was used to study bacterial plaque populations developing naturally to various cell densities per square millimeter of surface area of the enamel (W. F. Liljemark, C. G. Bloomquist, C. L. Bandt, B. L. Philstrom, J. E. Hinrichs, and L. F. Wolff, Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 8:5-15, 1993). Radiolabeled nucleoside incorporation was used to measure DNA synthesis concurrent with the taking of standard viable cell counts of the plaque samples. Results showed that in vivo plaque formation began with the rapid adherence of bacteria until ca. 12 to 32% of the enamel's salivary pellicle was saturated (ca. 2.5 x 10(5) to 6.3 x 10(5) cells per mm2). The pioneer adherent species were predominantly those of the "sanguis streptococci." At the above-noted density, the bacteria present on the salivary pellicle incorporated low levels of radiolabeled nucleoside per viable cell. As bacterial numbers reached densities between 8.0 x 10(5) and 2.0 x 10(6) cells per mm2, there was a small increase in the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleosides per cell. At 2.5 x 10(6) to 4.0 x 10(6) cells per mm2 of enamel surface, there was a marked increase in the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleosides per cell which appeared to be cell-density dependent. The predominant species group in developing dental plaque films during density-dependent growth was the sanguis streptococci; however, most other species present showed similar patterns of increased DNA synthesis as the density noted above approached 2.5 x 10(6) to 4.0 x 10(6) cells per mm2.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine varnish on Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies in plaque from dental fissures.
AB  - This study describes the effects of varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on Actinomyces naeslundii populations in plaque from human molar fissures. In each of 15 subjects two dental fissures with high levels of mutants streptococci were selected. The experimental treatment consisted of the single application of a small amount of chlorhexidine varnish onto the selected fissures. The varnish was removed 15 min after application. One month after varnish application a significant increase was observed in A. naeslundii counts while the number of mutans streptococci had decreased significantly compared with preexperimental levels. From 85 randomly selected Actinomyces isolates taken from blood agar plates before varnish application, 44% belonged to A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 56% to A. naeslundii genospecies 2. From 106 isolates taken 1 month after chlorhexidine varnish application, 42% belonged to A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 58% to A. naeslundii genospecies 2. At baseline 28% of A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were catalase-positive, but 1 month after varnish application 4% of the strains were catalase-positive (p < 0.05). It is concluded that chlorhexidine varnish application caused an increase of A. naeslundii in dental plaque, but induced no significant changes in the distribution of the two A. naeslundii genospecies.
TI  - Effect of titanium on selected oral bacterial species in vitro.
AB  - Titanium granules were tested for their antibacterial effect on strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Fusobacterium spp. and Prevotella intermedia in comparison with amalgam and two of its components, copper and tin. Glass beads were used as controls. The number of viable bacteria was estimated in samples exposed to the various materials for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h, respectively, and the viable counts were related to the baseline value. Titanium showed low antibacterial effect on the species tested. Copper and amalgam showed an expressed toxicity to all species and differed significantly from titanium and glass particles. Gram positive Streptococcus spp. and A. naeslundii showed a lower susceptibility to the metals than the Gram negative species. The antibacterial effect of copper and amalgam test particles on S. sanguis and P. intermedia was significantly decreased in the presence of serum. This study showed that some metals have a toxic effect in vitro on oral bacteria, a fact that may play a role in plaque formation when these materials are used for dental restorations. Titanium did not have a similar antibacterial effect.
TI  - Enhanced bactericidal activity of Arm and Hammer Dental Care.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare and contrast antibacterial activities of a baking soda-containing dentifrice, Arm and Hammer Dental Care (AHDC) with two fluoride dentifrices without baking soda (Crest and Colgate). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A biphasic approach was taken, utilizing newly-developed laboratory model systems to: (1) assess the activity of brief exposure to dentifrices on single and mixed cultures; and (2) determine the effect of multiple, short-term exposure of sucrose-colonized Streptococcus mutans to simulate cumulative activity against cariogenic plaque. RESULTS: The short-term exposure assays revealed that S. mutans was significantly more susceptible to AHDC than either Crest of Colgate (P<0.05). Moreover, exposure of mixed suspensions of bacteria by AHDC resulted in complete killing of Actinomyces viscosus and significantly greater decreases in S. mutans (P<0.05). This enhanced bactericidal effect was not due to an alkaline pH as pH-adjusted AHDC solutions exhibited similar activity. The comprehensive in vitro plaque studies showed that exposure of colonized S. mutans to AHDC resulted in significantly greater decreases in numbers of viable cells than Crest (P<0.05). Under the conditions employed, the baking soda-containing AHDC exhibited greater antibacterial efficacy overall than the standard Crest or Colgate pastes. These studies suggest that the use of AHDC may provide additional clinical benefit as a result of the enhanced bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Adherent mechanism of the mutans of Actinomyces viscosus T14V].
AB  - Three mutans of Actionmyces viscous T14V lacking type1 (5951), type 2 (5519) and  both types of fimbriae (147) were selected in this study. We compared the ability of their adsorption to the test-tube wall, the result of the cellular coaggregation between these mutant strains and Streptococcus sanguis 34, Streptococcus sanguis black bova, Streptococcus mutans ingbritte, Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 and analysed the chemical characterization of cell walls of the three mutans. We found that the specific fimbriae and cell hydrophobicities had great effect on the bacteria adsorption or coaggregation.
TI  - Studies into the microbial spectrum of apical periodontitis.
AB  - This study examined the variety of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacterial species recovered from cases of acute apical periodontitis. A total of 19 root canal samples and 24 periapical granuloma samples were taken from patients suffering pain and discomfort. Bacteria were identified by applying the following techniques: culturing on various media, Gram-staining and using commercially available biochemical test strips. In addition, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas endodontalis were differentiated on a molecular genetic level using species-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes. The most frequently identified bacteria were Prevotella intermedia, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus milleri-group and Bacteroides spp. Obligate anaerobes occurred at a rate of 82.3%, and the average number of isolates was 6.4 per sample.
TI  - Antibacterial action of dental cements: an in vitro study.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of seven commercially available dental cements (Eugespad, Dentical, Dycal, Expaliner, PR. Scell, PR. Base Cement, PR. Lining Cement) against 1) bacterial species implicated in carious lesions or in dental plaque (Actinomyces israelii ATCC 10048, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10557) and 2) bacterial samples of stimulated saliva was studied, in vitro, using a modification of the method of McComb and Ericson (1987). Dycal and Expaliner did not affect bacteria whereas the other dental cements displayed some antibacterial properties. Eugespad was the most active followed by PR. Base Cement + PR. Scell + Dentical and by PR. Lining Cement. Associated with mechanical and biocompatibility properties, these differences could be taken into account when choosing a dental cement for clinical use.
TI  - Bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. The absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. To identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. Peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mM) for 4 h and with the pH kept at 7.0 by a pH-stat. Removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or 294.4 mM [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. Hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, Streptococcus sanguis I and II (sanguis and oralis), and Strep. mitior (mitis biotype I); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mM were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mM when grown anaerobically. Earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. The amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. None of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, Neisseria sicca, Haemophilus segnis, H. parainfluenzae, Actinomyces viscosus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. The ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mM. This almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mM. In the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to dental amalgam and three resin composites.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The ability of three oral bacteria to adhere to hydrophobic amalgam (water contact angle 60 degrees) and hydrophobic resin composites (Prisma-AP.H 56 degrees. Herculite XRV 82 degrees and Z100 89 degrees) was compared using an in vitro assay. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following preincubation of the materials with human saliva, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the surfaces to adsorb carbon and nitrogen-containing compounds in a conditioning film that appeared to block the detection of Na and others in 2100 resin. Hg and Ag in amalgam, Si and Zn in Prisma AP.H resin and Ag and Na in Herculite resin. The precoating of the substrata by a proteinaceous conditioning film led to decreased binding of viable cells of Streptococcus sanguis CH3, Streptococcus salivarius HB and Actinomyces viscosus WG as compared with the adhesion to bare composites. With and without salivary coating, there was a correlation between increased bacterial hydrophobicity and increased retention on the substrata. However, there was no statistical difference in binding to the amalgam compared with the resin composites. In vitro studies showed that the bacteria autoaggregated in the presence of saliva. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the potential ability of normal oral flora to colonize resin composite.
TI  - Bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  - This study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with Asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Microbiological samples were taken under aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients. In the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (Group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. In the other 13 patients (Group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. In 7 patients of Group 1, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. In 4 patients of Group 2, P. intermedia, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. Biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.
TI  - Quantifying the strength of bacterial adhesive interactions with salivary glycoproteins.
AB  - We adapted an assay that has been used to estimate the strength of eukaryotic cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesive interactions (McClay et al., 1981) to quantify the strength of bacterial (streptococci, fusobacteria, actinomyces) interactions with salivary receptors. Bacteria are centrifuged onto human submandibular/sublingual or parotid-saliva-coated microtiter wells. Plates are sealed with pressure-sensitive, double-sided tape which allows them to be inverted and centrifuged again. The force required to remove the bacteria from the coated wells is a direct measure of the adhesive strength of the interaction(s) being disrupted. The bacteria-saliva adhesive forces we detected ranged from 1.6 x 10(-8) dynes (Streptococcus sanguis 72-40) to > 1.1 x 10(-7) dynes (Actinomyces viscosus T14 V). These forces were in the range to withstand the shear stress produced by salivary flow, which we calculated as approximately 6.1 x 10(-7) dynes.
TI  - Detection and incidence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(M) in the  microflora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on Trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. Each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene tet(M). Both PCR amplification and DNA hybridization, using a fragment of tet(M) from Tn1545, were used to detect tet(M). The PCR primers (5'-GACACGCCAGGACATATGG-3' and 5'-TGCTTTCCTCTTGTTCGAG-3') were chosen to amplify a 397 bp region of tet(M). Tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. The percentage of tet(M)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83% (mean of 10%). tet(M) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. The tet(M) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly S. intermedius, S. oralis, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus SM4), Actinomyces D01 (14%), Bifidobacterium D05 (11%), and Veillonella spp. (10%). Tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(M) was not detected included the Prevotella and Bacteroides species (41%, mainly Bacteroides D28, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. oris). These results suggest that tet(M) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of S. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not considered to be periodontopathogens. Assessment of other tetracycline-resistant genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.
TI  - Oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  - Despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. In this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (Ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough BSA-coated Ti surfaces. The smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for S. sanguis and A. viscosus. However, P. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated Ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with SEM. Cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both A. viscosus and P. gingivalis observed were associated with the Ti surfaces. Ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. The in vitro attachment system has proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant surfaces.
TI  - Adherence of microorganisms to rat salivary pellicles.
AB  - Numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. We compared the ability of Streptococcus and Actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsHA) and human saliva (sHA). We also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. We show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. Dissolved rsHA beads revealed a major protein band (35-49 kD), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kD and alpha-amylase (66 kD) were also identified. Overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsHA are similar to those observed with sHA.
TI  - A comparison of the microbial flora in carious dentine of clinically detectable and undetectable occlusal lesions.
AB  - It is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (HCL) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (SVL). Previous studies of the microflora of HCL suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. The aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 HCL and 17 SVL in a population of children aged 8-18 years. The following bacteria were identified: Actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii. Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus spp. Streptococcus mutans was found more often in the HCL group (p = 0.03), while Streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the SVL group (p = 0.05). However, proportions of both species were lower in the SVL group as compared with the HCL group (S. mutans p = 0.07; S. sobrinus p = 0.03). Lactobacilli and Actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. A more diverse range of streptococcal species and Veillonella was found in the SVL group (p = 0.001). These results show a less complex microflora in HCL as compared with SVL, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.
TI  - Streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of Streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  - Clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. Other streptococci and also Actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. We have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with Streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with S. mutans and strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis biovar I, and A. naeslundii. Left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of S. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. In mono-associated rats, S. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. In contrast, S. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. The suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. Counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but A. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. The findings demonstrate the crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  - Kinetics of lactose-reversible coadhesion of Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 398A and  Streptococcus oralis 34 on the surface of hexadecane droplets.
AB  - Most investigations of mechanisms accounting for intergeneric coaggregation have  emphasized stereospecific rather than nonspecific interactions. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative importance of lectin-carbohydrate and nonspecific hydrophobic and ionic interactions, using a model based on strains with one of the most well understood specific coaggregation mechanisms, the lactose-reversible coaggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus oralis. The kinetics of coadhesion and desorption of coadherent bacteria were studied using S. oralis 34 bound to hexadecane droplets as an affinity support for the adhesion of A. naeslundii WVU 398A. Light, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that A. naeslundii cells adhered only to the S. oralis cells, not to exposed hexadecane between the streptococci. Coadhesion was inhibited by lactose concentrations as low as 2.0 mM. The rate of coadhesion was halved at 60 mM lactose. The hydrophobicity inhibitors bovine serum albumin and defatted bovine serum albumin and the salts LiCl and KCl failed to inhibit coadhesion in the hexadecane assay, and bovine serum albumin also failed to inhibit coaggregation in a bacterial aggregation assay on glass slides. High concentrations of the salts achieved a 50% rate decrease in A. naeslundii adhesion to the S. oralis-coated droplets only when they were combined with > 20 mM lactose. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Tween 20 inhibition was tested by the slide coaggregation assay because they tended to emulsify the droplets; SDS was inhibitory. Lactose selectively desorbed A. naeslundii from S. oralis-coated droplets at low concentrations equivalent to those that inhibited coadhesion. Neither LiCl nor KCl desorbed A. naeslundii from the droplets, even at 500 mM. At low concentrations, SDS but not Tween 20 eluted both A. naeslundii and S. oralis from the droplets. Although the SDS results might suggest a degree of cooperative charge interactions, the results support the hypothesis that stereospecific, beta-galactoside-sensitive interactions have a much greater impact than nonspecific interactions on the coadhesion of A. naeslundii and S. oralis.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus gordonii PK488 coaggregation adhesin gene, scaA, and ATP-binding cassette.
AB  - Human oral viridans group streptococci that coaggregate with Actinomyces naeslundii PK606 express surface proteins related to ScaA, the coaggregation-mediating adhesin of Streptococcus gordonii PK488 (R. N. Andersen, N. Ganeshkumar, and P. E. Kolenbrander, Infect. Immun. 61:981-987, 1993). The nucleotide sequence of the 6,125-bp EcoRI insert of pRA1, containing scaA, the gene encoding ScaA, was determined. Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The orientation of four ORFs, two upstream (ORF 1 and ORF 2) and one downstream (ORF 4) of scaA (ORF 3), indicated transcription in one direction, whereas ORF 5 and ORF 6 were transcribed divergently. Computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences identified a consensus binding site for ATP (GxxGxGKS) in the putative 28,054-Da protein encoded by ORF 1. ORF 2 potentially encoded a hydrophobic protein of 29,705 Da with six potential membrane-spanning regions. ScaA was 310 amino acids, 34,787 Da, and contained the lipoprotein consensus sequence LxxC, also reported for the ScaA-related proteins SsaB, FimA, and PsaA from Streptococcus sanguis 12, Streptococcus parasanguis FW213, and Streptococcus pneumoniae R36A, respectively. ORF 4 potentially encoded a 163-amino-acid protein of 17,912 Da, which was nearly identical to the downstream adjacent gene products of ssaB, fimA, and psaA. No significant homology with other proteins was found with the putative ORF 5 gene product, a 229-amino-acid protein of 25,107 Da. ORF 6 was incomplete and encoded a protein larger than 564 amino acids. This putative protein had a consensus Zn2+ binding motif, HExxH, found among bacterial thermolysins and mammalian neutral endopeptidases and was 40% identical to a homologous 210-amino-acid region of human enkephalinase. The genetic organization of ORFs 1, 2, and 3 was similar to those of the bacterial periplasmic-binding protein-dependent transport systems of gram-negative bacteria and binding-lipoprotein-dependent transport systems of gram-positive bacteria, and these genes appeared to encode ABC (ATP-binding cassette) proteins. This report describes a cell-to-cell adherence function associated with an ATP-binding cassette.

TI  - Cell surface protein receptors in oral streptococci.
AB  - Streptococci have a vast repertoire of adherence properties which include binding to human tissue components, epithelial cells and to other bacterial cells. These interactions are determined by the expression of cell-surface receptors some of which are species-specific. In the oral streptococci, two families of surface protein receptors with highly conserved amino acid sequences have been identified. The antigen I/II family of polypeptides are wall-associated high molecular mass proteins (158-166 kDa) with several binding functions that may be attributed to different domains of the receptor molecules. The LraI family of polypeptides are surface-associated lipoproteins (32-33 kDa) involved in adherence of streptococci to salivary glycoprotein pellicle and to oral Actinomyces. A region of amino acid sequence similarity is evident amongst members of the two protein families in Streptococcus gordonii. Ligand-binding specificities of these receptor polypeptides may account for species-specific adherence and site-directed colonization of streptococci within the human oral cavity.
TI  - In vitro modulation of oral bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads by milk casein derivatives.
AB  - Bovine caseinate, derivatives of its glycosylated moiety [caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGP)], and caseinophosphopeptides were evaluated as inhibitors of adhesion of oral bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (S-HA). All milk casein-derived components behaved as potent inhibitors of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 and Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176 adhesion to S-HA, whereas neither bovine serum albumin nor polyethyleneglycol were able to interfere with the adhesion of these strains. By contrast, none of the molecular species tested was able to inhibit the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus Ny 1 to S-HA. On the other hand, casein derivatives were shown to displace human serum albumin from S-HA beads. They were also able to bind to the bacterial cell surface of all strains examined. Collectively, these findings suggest that interactions between acidic casein-derived milk components and the biological surfaces involved in bacterial adhesion to S-HA result in an inhibitory effect that is selective for the oral streptococci examined.
TI  - A study of the subgingival microflora of HIV-seropositive and CD4 cell depleted children with hemophilia.
AB  - The cultivable subgingival bacterial flora from three HIV-seropositive and CD4 cell depleted children with hemophilia were examined in this study. The numbers of CD4 cells of the subjected children ranged from 4.9 to 16.3 per mm3 blood. Streptococcus species, including, beta-hemolytic streptococcus identified as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, were predominant in the subgingival plaque samples. Actinomyces species were also frequently found. Gram-negative rods other than Capnocytophaga species were not common in these samples. It is possible that the subgingival microbial flora are influenced by the CD4 cell decrease with HIV infection.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effect of pyrophosphate on oral bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether pyrophosphate, the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, exerts antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria commonly found in supragingival plaque. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of pyrophosphate were determined for Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. All of the bacteria tested were susceptible to pyrophosphate with identical minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.67% wt/vol (25 mM). Bactericidal kinetics assays revealed that both S. mutans and A. viscosus were killed by pyrophosphate, with the latter being considerably more susceptible. The mechanism of killing was not due to high ionic strength, as comparable controls showed no loss in numbers of viable cells. Brief exposure (two 5-min incubations) of S. mutans to pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate caused pronounced inhibition of growth over the 24-h test period. Under the constraints of the conditions used, these studies indicate that pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate can substantially inhibit the growth of oral bacteria. These compounds may affect the oral microflora of patients who routinely use tartar-control dentifrices and mouthrinses.
TI  - Characteristics of accumulation of oral gram-positive bacteria on mucin-conditioned glass surfaces in a model system.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (pH 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of D = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. The accumulation of cells followed four phases. In phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. Phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (Cdt) Streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, Actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and Lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. Cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): Cdt Streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, Actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and Lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. The biofilm stabilized in Phase 4, Cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. The numbers (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were Streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, Actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and Lactobacillus, 2.77. Accumulation increased (Cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  - The treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. Microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. To investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other Streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. Occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. Analyses of sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that S. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while Actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. Mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. The pattern of recolonization by individual Streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: S. oralis and S. sanguis were primary colonizers while S. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. It is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.
TI  - A quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  - The levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. The numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. Selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries, but not from root surface caries. The proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. In root surface caries, Actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. The proportion of Lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. Immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.
TI  - A microbiological study of recurrent dentinal caries.
AB  - A cross-sectional microbiological study of recurrent (secondary) dentinal caries  was conducted. Freshly extracted human teeth containing amalgam restorations judged to be clinically intact were scrubbed with chlorhexidine soap and soaked in povidone-iodine solution. The teeth were then split to remove the fillings and examined for dentinal caries. Of 54 teeth examined, 22 (40%) were free of dentinal caries in the restored site. The remainder were assigned to arbitrary groups of questionable (15), initial (8) and active caries (9), based on the amount of dentinal decay observed. Comparison of pre-extraction bite-wing radiographs with the in situ findings revealed the sensitivity for secondary caries detection to be only about 50%. In contrast, the specificity for absence of caries was 73%. There was considerable variation in the numbers and types of micro-organisms found in dentine samples from lesions of comparable severity. Facultatively, anaerobic streptococci were the most numerous and most prevalent micro-organisms in the affected dentine, but no single species was significantly associated with recurrent caries. Mutans streptococci were found in 40% of sites with any degree of caries and in only 3 of the 9 sites with the most caries. Homofermentative lactobacilli were present in 18 of the 54 dentine samples, including 4 from caries-free sites. While the prevalence and numbers of lactobacilli increased with the degree of caries, they occurred in less than half of the affected dentine samples. Actinomyces occurred in 15 of 32 affected sites but only in 2 of the 9 most active sites. Their numbers never exceeded 3 x 10(3) CFU/mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - Antiseptic mouthrinse-induced microbial cell surface alterations.
AB  - This study determined the effect of an essential oil-containing mouthrinse, Listerine Antiseptic, on microbial cell surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy. Twenty-four hour cultures of C. albicans, A. viscosus, S. sanguis, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were harvested and washed in buffer. Triplicate samples were overlaid on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips, immersed in either Listerine or buffer for 30 seconds, fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in Peldri II. Exposure of the microorganisms to Listerine Antiseptic for 30 seconds resulted in distinct morphological alterations of cell surfaces suggestive of loss of cell surface integrity. The extent of alteration varied among the structurally different species; cell surface roughening was mild in S. sanguis but extensive in the other microorganisms which developed distinct surface blebs and other abnormalities after the 30-second exposure. These results suggest that a brief exposure to Listerine produces significant morphological changes which may be associated with cell death and may help explain the alteration of surface-associated activities demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against bacterial lectin of Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - A lectin-like substance (EcLS) was purified from the Eikenella corrodens 1073 cell and monoclonal antibodies were produced against it to confirm the role of EcLS in adhesive properties of E. corrodens such as hemagglutination and coaggregation with oral bacteria. Four hybridoma clones were selected. Two of the antibodies were of the IgG1 isotype and the others were of the IgG2b isotype. These monoclonal antibodies inhibited both the hemagglutination of E. corrodens and the coaggregation with Actinomyces viscosus or Streptococcus sanguis. The reactivity of the monoclonal antibody to E. corrodens 1073 was significantly higher than that to E. corrodens 1080 of which adhesive activity was weaker than that of E. corrodens 1073. These findings suggest the difference in adhesive properties is due to the difference in the amount of EcLS expressed on the cell surface. The immunoelectron microscopic study revealed that EcLS of E. corrodens 1073 was localized in the outer space of outer membrane, not in cell surface appendages such as fimbriae where bacteria possessed adhesin. These results suggest that coaggregation of E. corrodens with A. viscosus or S. sanguis was mediated by EcLS.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral lactobacilli with streptococci from the oral cavity.
AB  - The ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. Of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. Lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus crista and tufted Streptococcus sanguis II strains. Lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with S. gordonii and S. sanguis. The coaggregation between L. salivarius and S. salivarius, S. gordonii or tufted S. sanguis II strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. The coaggregation between L. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
TI  - Glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation in the oral bacterium Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus T14V, a Gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. Basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 U) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. Further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl cAMP. Glucose, on the other hand, stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Fructose and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on cAMP accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. Other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were without effect. Glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate cAMP accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Glucose did not stimulate cAMP levels in other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. salivarius but did cause cAMP accumulation in other strains of A. viscosus. The results suggest that glucose effects on cAMP metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for Escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the A. viscosus bacteria. The results also suggest that glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - In vitro study of the penetration of three bacterial strains into root dentine.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess in vitro migration of the following three bacterial species into dentinal tubules: Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Prevotella intermedia. Twenty-seven bovine incisors were randomly divided into three groups. Only the root dentin was used for the experiment. Within each group, the nine incisors were sectioned into 36 dentin blocks that were incubated with one of the tested bacterial suspensions. Twelve samples were taken after 10, 20, and 28 days. Half the samples were observed with scanning electron microscopy and the others with light microscopy after standard histologic procedures, and the depth of bacterial penetration was measured. Analysis of the examinations showed that whatever the technique used, only one strain on this experimental model migrated into dentinal tubules. S. sanguis was observed at a depth of 792 microns, but no migration was observed for either A.naeslundii or P.intermedia. The differences in migration of the bacteria tested appear to be related to their morphologic factors and cellular arrangement.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  - The susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. Agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microL each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Of all the compounds tested, Gluma cleanser and Gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Prisma Universal Bond 2 and Superlux Universal Bond 2 systems. The primers of Gluma, Denthesive, and Scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. Zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of Scotchbond 2 and Tripton with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. No inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of XR-Bond on S sanguis and A viscosus was not affected by light curing.
TI  - Cloning of the Streptococcus gordonii PK488 gene, encoding an adhesin which mediates coaggregation with Actinomyces naeslundii PK606.
AB  - Coaggregation between Streptococcus gordonii PK488 and Actinomyces naeslundii PK606 is mediated by a 38-kDa streptococcal protein, designated ScaA. The gene, scaA, which encodes this protein has been cloned into Escherichia coli. A genomic S. gordonii PK488 library (in Lambda ZAP II) was screened with anti-S. gordonii immunoglobulin G absorbed with S. gordonii PK1804, an isogenic coaggregation-defective mutant of strain PK488. A positive recombinant phage was isolated, and a phagemid designated pRA1 was obtained which contained a 6.6-kb insert. Expression of scaA from pRA1 and from a subcloned internal 2.1-kb fragment was observed. The absorbed antiserum cross-reacted with a 34.7-kDa protein, SsaB, from S. sanguis 12, also a coaggregation partner of A. naeslundii PK606. Absorbed antiserum to S. gordonii PK488 and antiserum to SsaB both reacted with 38-kDa proteins in supernatants from mildly sonicated preparations from 11 other coaggregation partners of A. naeslundii PK606. Putative adhesin genes were identified in each of these coaggregation partners by Southern analysis of their genomic DNA with the cloned 2.1-kb fragment as a probe. A 30-base oligonucleotide probe based on the sequence of ssaB of S. sanguis 12 hybridized in an identical manner. These data extend the notion that most of the viridans streptococci that coaggregate with actinomyces are capable of expressing ScaA-related proteins.
TI  - Dental plaque development on defined streptococcal surfaces.
AB  - Coaggregations between bacterial species have been widely studied in vitro but not in the mouth. A new in vivo assay was used to measure the rate and composition of indigenous plaque formation onto bovine enamel chips covered with a continuous layer of bacteria. Chips were covered with Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10557, which coaggregated with many oral species, or Streptococcus gordonii S7, which did not coaggregate with these oral species, and placed in the mouth for 4 and 24 h. There were no differences in the number of most indigenous bacterial species isolated from the two streptococcal surfaces. However, the number of Actinomyces viscosus as a proportion of total Actinomyces spp. was significantly different on the two surfaces at 24 h. With the exception of Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus removed from the S7 surface, all indigenous species increased significantly in number from 4 to 24 h, irrespective of the streptococcal surface. This study demonstrated that interbacterial coaggregation had only a limited effect on in vivo plaque development. Thus suggesting that environmental factors, growth or other adherence phenomena are dominant in in vivo plaque formation.
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - The effect of glass-ionomer cement on carious dentine: an in vivo study.
AB  - The effect of a glass-ionomer cement sealant on carious dentine was investigated  clinically and bacteriologically. The study group consisted of 24 molar teeth, with small clinical visible occlusal dentine lesions, in 13 children (aged 7-18 years). Twenty of these molars were filled and sealed with a glass-ionomer cement (Fuji Ionomer Type III) and 4 with a resin sealant (Delton). From each molar, two dentine samples were collected aseptically with a time interval of 7 months. The first sample was taken after opening the lesion just beneath the dentino-enamel junction before application of the filling material (sample A), and the second beneath the removed filling material (sample B) 7 months later. Before collecting sample B the sealant was clinically evaluated and impressions were prepared in order to (re)evaluate the sealants later by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After taking the second sample, the remaining fissures were opened to a standard depth, the caries which was still present was removed, and a composite resin restoration was applied. In all teeth, more glass-ionomer cement material was found by SEM compared to the clinical evaluation. In both the glass-ionomer- and the resin sealant-treated group, the median value of the total number of microorganisms (CFU) on blood agar was 100 times smaller in the B sample. Microorganisms were found in 90% of the B samples in the group treated with glass-ionomer cement; hard dentine was also found in 45% of the B samples from this group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Actinomyces viscosus mutants defective in binding salivary proline-rich proteins.
AB  - Recent studies have provided evidence for human salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs) serving as potential receptors in the acquired pellicle for Actinomyces viscosus type 1 fimbriae. We report here the isolation of mutants derived from A. viscosus T14V-J1 which are defective in binding to PRPs partially purified from parotid gland saliva. Mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate preceded enrichment for cells nonreactive with PRPs by successive adsorptions with PRP-treated latex beads. Screening was accomplished by random selection of 250 isolated colonies from each of four enrichment cycles and reaction with PRP-treated latex beads in microtiter plates. Two mutants of independent origin were examined for adherence to hydroxyapatite treated with either PRPs, proline-rich glycoproteins, deglycosylated proline-rich glycoproteins, or whole saliva. Additional surface properties that were examined included agglutination with polyclonal antisera to type 1 and type 2 fimbriae, agglutination by a monoclonal antibody to type 1 fimbriae that inhibits adherence of the parent strain to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite, the ability to bind monoclonal antibody to the type 1 fimbrial subunit, and lactose-reversible coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguis 34. Both mutants exhibited reduced binding to hydroxyapatite treated with whole saliva or salivary protein preparations but were still capable of reaction with antiserum to type 1 and type 2 fimbriae. In addition, these mutants possessed the ability to bind monoclonal antibody to the type 1 fimbrial subunit in amounts comparable to the amount bound by the parent strain but were not agglutinated by the adherence-inhibiting monoclonal antibody. When considered with previously published data, these results suggest that an adhesive molecule is probably associated with type 1 fimbriae and allows for the interaction of A. viscosus with constituents in the salivary pellicle.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Effect of slow-release chlorhexidine mouthguards on the levels of selected salivary bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of an alternate delivery system for chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (MS) and other selected oral bacteria. On the basis of salivary MS levels > or = 10(4) CFU/ml, 22 subjects were enrolled. All caries lesions were restored prior to treatment. Two pretreatment paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were obtained for culturing at least 1 week apart. Complete-arch vacuum-adapted mouthguards were individually fabricated and coated internally with a 3% w/v chlorhexidine varnish. Mouthguards were worn for an average of 7 h/night for 7 nights. Saliva samples were obtained immediately after treatment and 1 and 3 months later. There was no significant change in levels of any of the monitored bacteria between the two pretreatment samples. A significant and specific reduction in salivary MS levels was observed in the three after-treatment samples as compared with baseline values (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively). The levels of Actinomyces viscosus were also measured, and there was a significant reduction immediately after treatment (p < 0.05), a return to baseline values at 1 month, and a significant increase above baseline values at 3 months, (p < 0.001). There was no significant change in saliva volume, in total numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria, or in levels of lactobacilli or Streptococcus sanguis. This treatment system is capable of significant and specific suppression of MS levels for up to 3 months without retreatment.
TI  - Multibacterial artificial plaque. A model for studying carious process.
AB  - A multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus. Typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. The caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. The lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. The acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. It is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in the media. Moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  - This study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. Disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of Teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. The bacterial species tested included: A. viscosus, S. mitis, S. mutans, L. casei, and S. sanguis. Growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 mL of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. On other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. All agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. The four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with S. mutans for three days. Adhering materials were disclosed and scored. An ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. The two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. No growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. All four restorative materials reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. Elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.
TI  - The endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  - The microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. A total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, Peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by Eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'Streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus), Enterococcus faecalis and Prevotella oralis (formerly Bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. Highly significant associations were discovered between four pairs of species, viz P. melaninogenica with P. micros, P. melaninogenica with P. oralis, Prevotella corporis with Streptococcus morbillorum and Actinomyces odontolyticus with E. faecalis.
TI  - Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  - Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.
TI  - An augmented regenerative technique for severe osseous defects.
AB  - Techniques for new attachment using the principle of guided tissue regeneration with barrier membranes have become accepted as a method for treating teeth with severe osseous defects and furcation involvement. After an evaluation of existing membranes and techniques, a procedure was developed using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene soft tissue patch, 1 mm thick (W. L. Gore and Assoc., Flagstaff, AZ), in conjunction with an alloplast hydroxylapatite bone substitute (HA-500, 40-60 mesh) (Orthomatrix, Minneapolis, MN), to maintain a space for the maturation of the blood clot. An in vitro study of microbial adherence to the soft tissue patch indicated that the number of attached Streptococcus sanguis (gordonii) G9B, and Actinomyces viscosus T14 (V) cells was significantly lower (P < .005 and P < .025, respectively) than the number of bacteria that attached to Gore-Tex Periodontal Material. Two case reports are presented to demonstrate the successful use of the soft tissue patch augmented with hydroxylapatite in patients exhibiting furcation involvement and severe vertical osseous defects.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  - The effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish Cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (ADT-test in vitro). As positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. The test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one Candida strain. The positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. No antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. Toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against S. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. The results from this study support earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. The possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.
TI  - Salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of Streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  - Interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. Streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. The salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. Salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis or A. viscosus. Adherence of S. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. Expression of the S. sanguis receptor (SSP-5) gene in Enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus. This interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. The results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis and A. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on S. mutans.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of stannous fluoride and other commonly used antimicrobial agents on oral bacteria.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of stannous fluoride (SnF2) gel and other commonly used oral antimicrobial agents/products. The antibacterial inhibitory effect of the various agents was evaluated by their effect against oral plaque bacteria including strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius. A lawn of the specific bacteria to be tested was placed onto blood agar plates. Wells were then punched into the agar and each well was filled with 75 microliters of one of the antimicrobial products or control solutions. A positive control was a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution and a negative control was physiological saline. Agar plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees C for 5-7 days. Zones of inhibition in the lawn of bacteria were measured by a boley gauge. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and mean zones of bacterial inhibition were determined. Only 0.4% SnF2 and 0.12% chlorhexidine were consistently more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria when compared with other commercial mouth rinses/agents which had any one of a variety of antimicrobial agents as ingredients (alpha = 0.05). This in vitro study demonstrates that stannous fluoride gel is as effective as chlorhexidine in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in dental plaque.
TI  - Effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  - Surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. A polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. In all bacteria (B. gingivalis, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode. Treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. Moreover, in the case of B. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. These findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of B. gingivalis was dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. Thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, B. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a gene coding for a saliva-binding protein (SsaB) from Streptococcus sanguis 12 and possible role of the protein in coaggregation with actinomyces.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.9-kb streptococcal DNA fragment which codes for two proteins with MrS of 36,000 (Streptococcus sanguis adhesin B [SsaB]) and 20,000 has been determined. The ssaB gene is 927 bp and codes for a 34,684-Da protein. The open reading frame coding for the 20-kDa protein is 489 bp and codes for a protein of 17,885 Da. The SsaB protein has a putative hydrophobic 19-amino-acid signal sequence resulting in a 32,620-Mr secreted protein, whereas the 20-kDa protein has no signal sequence. Both proteins are hydrophilic, and neither appears to have a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence in the carboxy-terminal region. A DNA sequence homology of 73% exists between the cloned fragment containing the ssaB gene from S. sanguis 12 and the cloned fragment containing the type 1 fimbrial gene of S. sanguis FW213 (J.C. Fenno, D.J. LeBlanc, and P. Fives-Taylor, Infect. Immun. 57:3527-3533, 1989). Amino acid comparisons of the SsaB and type 1 fimbrial proteins show 87% homology, indicating a close similarity of the two proteins. Antiserum raised against the cloned SsaB protein cross-reacts with a 38-kDa protein identified from Streptococcus gordonii (S. sanguis) PK488 which was proposed to mediate coaggregation with Actinomyces naeslundii PK606 (P.E. Kolenbrander and R.N. Andersen, Infect. Immun. 58:3064-3072, 1990). The SsaB adhesion may play a role in oral colonization by binding either to a receptor on saliva or to a receptor on actinomyces.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga orchracea, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis. The enzymes produced by Capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mM chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. Glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. Chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mM inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. These observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
TI  - Comparison of the plaque microflora from natural and appliance-borne enamel surfaces.
AB  - Human enamel sections and slabs, mounted on a mandibular removable appliance, were worn by 5 adult subjects for a 1-week period. Plaque was allowed to accumulate on the in situ test sites and on the adjacent natural dentition. At the end of the experimental period, the plaque microflora associated with (1) the enamel sections, (2) the enamel slabs, and (3) the acrylic base of the appliance test site was compared with that obtained from lingual and interproximal areas of the lower molar teeth. In addition, the acid anion and pH profiles of plaque obtained from both the exogenous and natural tooth surfaces were also determined. Although some quantitative differences were found between the proportions of isolates obtained from the different enamel surfaces, qualitatively the microflora was very similar, and no significant differences were found in the plaque lactate/acetate ratios or pH measurements following a sucrose mouthrinse. Thus, human tooth specimens mounted on the intra-oral device produced a plaque ecosystem similar to that present on the adjacent natural dentition, suggesting that the model is suitable for studies on early plaque development and the microbiology of enamel demineralization.
TI  - Interactions of sanguinarine and zinc on oral streptococci and Actinomyces species.
AB  - Sanguinaria extract, which contains benzophenanthridine alkaloids, has been used  as a folk medicine for many years. Minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC values) for sanguinarine were determined for common and etiologically important plaque bacteria. Because the efficacy of sanguinarine is believed to be enhanced by zinc, isobolograms were assessed to determine their mode(s) of interaction. Hydrogen ion concentration influenced the inhibitory activity of both sanguinarine and zinc. For sanguinarine, at the optimum pH (6.5), MIC values were 4 or 8 micrograms/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. MIC values were 0.125-0.50 mmol Zn/ml. MBC values ranged from 1 to 8 mmol Zn/ml at pH 5.5. Isobologram data revealed that sanguinarine and zinc interacted synergistically. Viadent oral rinse, which contained 300 micrograms sanguinaria extract/ml and 0.2% zinc chloride (14.9 mmol Zn/l), was inhibitory to all strains tested. MIC values were 1 or 2% (ml Viadent oral rinse/100 ml aqueous solution) for all strains except A. viscosus for which the MIC value was 12% (vol/vol).
TI  - Association of selected bacteria with the lesions of root surface caries.
AB  - Plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. Five subject groups were defined: A (DMFS 16.4), B (DMFS 55.9), C1 (DMFS 55.6), C2 (DMFS 57.0) and C3 (DMFS 48.1). Groups C1 and C2 had unrestored root surface lesions; Group A, B and C3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. Streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in Groups C1 and C2 than from intact root surfaces in Group A. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis 1 and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from Group A. The percentage contribution that S. mutans made to plaque from lesions in Groups C1 and C2 was higher than that from plaque in Group A and Actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in Group C1 than in samples from Group A. The percentage counts of Lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in Groups C1 and C2 were higher than those from intact roots in Groups A, B, and C3. Subjects were also grouped on the presence of Lactobacillus and S. mutans in plaque samples. Samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of S. mitis 1 and also A. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing S. mutans or Lactobacillus. Actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples containing both S. mutans and Lactobacillus. The results confirm an association of S. mutans and Lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and A. viscosus serovar 2.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.
AB  - Seventeen strains of oral bacteria of the genera Actinomyces (5), Bacteroides (3), and Streptococcus (9) were tested for aggregation by the human whole salivary mucin fraction (HWSM) in comparison to three types of animal mucin preparations from submandibular glands of cow (BSM) and sheep (OSM), and from the stomach of pig (PGM). Considerable variation was seen with respect to the rate and titer of aggregation induced by these mucins. The aggregating activity of HWSM varied widely among the different bacterial strains. The Bacteroides group showed hardly any induced aggregation, whereas the final aggregation titers varied for S. sanguis (3 strains) between 12 and 48, for S. oralis (3 strains) between 6 and 48, for the S. mutans group (3 strains) between 6 and 96, and for the five Actinomyces strains even between 6 and 192. For a particular strain, similar differences in titer were seen between the four mucins. For a human salivary mucin (MG-2) it has been described that sialic acid in the sequence NeuAc (alpha 2,3)Gal(beta 1,3)GalNac- was specifically involved in the interaction with S. sanguis strains, in contrast to S. rattus BHT. Our results, however, indicate that this sugar sequence is not a prerequisite for the aggregation of S. sanguis, as animal mucins, devoid of this structure, were equally well or even better capable of inducing aggregation. On the other hand, desialization of BSM and OSM largely abolished their aggregating capability towards S. rattus BHT. Moreover, it was found that BSM and OSM, which are comparable with respect to their major oligosaccharide structure, show considerable differences in aggregating activity towards the same bacterial strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cerebral botryomycosis: case study.
AB  - After oral surgery, a 32-year-old man developed a brain abscess. Actinomycosis was suspected due to history, clinical findings, response to penicillin therapy, and demonstration of "sulfur granules" in the surgical specimen, but anaerobic cultures were negative for Actinomyces. Aerobic cultures yielded Streptococcus sanguis and Pseudomonas cepacia. Coccoid organisms demonstrated histologically reacted positively with periodic acid-Schiff, Gomori's methenamine silver, and Brown and Brenn stains, were Ziehl-Neelsen-negative, and did not include branching filaments. Fluorescent antibody assay for Actinomyces israelii was also negative. Electron microscopy revealed cell wall morphology and pattern of cell division characteristic of gram-positive cocci. These findings led to a final diagnosis of botromycosis due to S. sanguis. This third report of cerebral botryomycosis emphasizes the differential diagnosis with actinomycosis, the association with intermittently treated jaw disease, and identification of the causative agent by histologic, immunologic, and electron microscopic methods.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus gordonii (S. sanguis) PK488 adhesin-mediated coaggregation with Actinomyces naeslundii PK606.
AB  - Intergeneric coaggregation of Streptococcus gordonii (S. sanguis) PK488 and Actinomyces naeslundii PK606 was studied by using coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of both strains. A streptococcal protein of 38 kilodaltons was identified with anti-S. gordonii serum absorbed with Cog- cells of the streptococcus. Absorbed immunoglobulin G specifically blocked coaggregation of the streptococcus-actinomyces pair but did not affect the coaggregation of the streptococcus with other coaggregation partners. The 38-kilodalton protein was found in the supernatant of mild sonicated cell suspensions and was extracted from whole cells with sodium barbital or with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS). An immunoreactive protein of the same size was found in sonicated cell supernatants of several other oral streptococci that also coaggregated with A. naeslundii PK606. Inhibition of S. gordonii PK488-A. naeslundii PK606 coaggregation was not observed with any of 16 different sugars tested. We propose that a functionally similar adhesin that mediates coaggregations with A. naeslundii PK606 is expressed by several species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Effect of a triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice on the oral microflora.
AB  - Eighty-one human subjects completed a double-blind study which examined the effects of a 0.3% triclosan/2% Gantrez copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice on the microflora of supragingival dental plaque. Subjects were divided into an experimental group which performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice and a control group which also performed normal oral hygiene with the same dentifrice minus the triclosan/copolymer. At baseline, 10 weeks, and 28 weeks, supragingival dental plaque was collected from buccal and lingual surfaces of the four first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase contrast microscopy, 2) Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces species, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Wolinella recta by immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3) Lactobacillus, yeast, enterics, Staphylococcus, aerobes and anaerobes by bacterial culture. After 28 weeks' use of their respective dentifrices, changes in the supragingival plaque microflora of the subjects were similar between the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the control dentifrice group, except for statistically significant reductions in fusiforms, spirochetes and staphylococci and significant increases in S. sanguis in the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group, as compared to the control dentifrice group. The subject population was unusual in the presence of enteric species and anaerobes found in supragingival plaque sites. This study indicates that the use of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan and 2% Gantrez copolymer over an extended period of time (28 weeks) does not result in shifts in the microflora of supragingival plaque favoring the growth of either opportunistic or pathogenic bacterial species.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  - A total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. Ninety-five percent of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2% w/v). Phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as Bacterodides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Wolinella recta. Addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. For most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. These results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.
TI  - The influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  - Sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. Sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. When sucrolose was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar pH falls, compared with controls. The incorporation of 126 mmol/L sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, Streptococcus sanguis 10904, Streptococcus sanguis Challis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus WVU627. Sucralose had no effect on IPS production. Sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. Sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. No radioactive polymer was formed from 14C-U-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (GTF) or fructosyl-transferase (FTF). Inhibition of GTF and FTF by sucralose was removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. These results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on GTF and FTF was non-competitive and reversible. The results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.
TI  - Penetration of dentine by three oral bacteria in vitro and their associated cytotoxicity.
AB  - Three common oral bacteria, namely Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Corynebacterium spp. were studied with regard to their ability to penetrate etched and unetched dentine and for their effect on underlying cell cultures. The test organisms were grown in cylinders above dentine slices 100 and 500 microns thick for 72 hours. The slices were in contact with tissue culture medium covering a layer of fibroblasts. Penetration of 100 microns slices was most rapid with S. sanguis, followed by A. viscosus and Corynebacterium. The pattern was similar but slightly delayed when 500 microns slices were used, but in most cases penetration had occurred by 72 hours. The presence of a smear layer had no effect on the results obtained. Following penetration, cell destruction was most extensive with S. sanguis, the most cytotoxic organism, followed by Corynebacterium and A. viscosus. In the limited number of dishes where no penetration occurred there was little effect on cell numbers.
TI  - Adherence of mutans streptococci to other oral bacteria.
AB  - Adherence of mutans streptococci to strains of Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane was measured. Strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and S. rattus bound in a lactose-independent manner to a variety of the actinomyces and streptococci. Most of these reactions could proceed in the presence of whole saliva although adherence of S. rattus BHT to the streptococci was inhibited by salivary molecules. In contrast, adherence of S. mutans 10449 and KPSK2 to A. viscosus, S. sanguis, and S. mitis was enhanced by salivary molecules. S. mutans KPSK2, S. sobrinus OMZ 176, and S. rattus FA-1 binding to A. viscosus NC3 and S. sanguis G9B exhibited saturation kinetics. Adherence to A. viscosus NC3 was of a higher avidity than adherence to S. sanguis G9B. Attachment of S. mutans KPSK2 to S. sanguis G9B and of S. mutans OMZ 176 to A. viscosus NC3 and S. sanguis G9B was inhibited by heat treatment of the mutans streptococci. Attachment of S. mutans KPSK2 to A. viscosus NC3 and of S. rattus FA-1 to A. viscosus NC3 and S. sanguis G9B was unaffected by heat. These observations suggest that the mutans streptococci can adhere to a variety of early plaque bacteria by several distinct mechanisms. Such interactions may be important in the colonization of tooth surfaces by the mutans streptococci.
TI  - Microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  - Studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on Gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. Both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. Since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on Streptococcus mutans, and S. mutans and Lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. Subsequent studies confirmed an association between S. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. Thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state of the lesion. A second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. Most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' S. mutans, S. sanguis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Lactobacillus, and Veillonella. However, it has been known for 17 years that the Actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii. Such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of Actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. A similar situation exists with oral Streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. Recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. Recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain S. mutans and Lactobacillus show a high isolation of S. mitis 1 and no isolations of A. naeslundii. Careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.
TI  - Selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  - The present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. Buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a model for study. Bacteria studied included Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, Actinomyces species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. Treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. Neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of S. sanguis and S. mitis studied. In contrast, the number of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii and A. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. Neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of B. intermedius and B. gingivalis. Treatment of buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. Such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and A. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius were significantly increased. Treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human PMNs produced similar selective effects. The changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.
TI  - Surface-associated properties of Streptococcus milleri group strains and their potential relation to pathogenesis.
AB  - Thirty strains from the Streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (SMG) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of S. sanguis, S. mutans and S. pyogenes. The SMG strains were heterogeneous in all tests. Most (18) belonged to one of the Lancefield groups with group F predominating. Adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). Compared with strains of S. sanguis, SMG strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. They differed from the type strain of S. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for S. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). Strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than 0.001). The ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. The amount of fibronectin bound by SMG strains correlated with their ability to adhere to SHA (p less than 0.001). The hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. Some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. A minority of strains possessed a net positive cell-surface charge. Neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to SHA. Strains of SMG co-aggregated weakly with strains of Veillonella parvula, V. dispar, Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii.
TI  - The microbiology of periapical granulomas.
AB  - Of the 16 periapical granulomas studied, 14 (88%) yielded a positive growth when  homogenized and cultured. The concentration of colony-forming units per milliliter of the suspension ranged from 10(1.3) to 10(4.0) (mean 10(2.2)). A total of 47 isolates comprising 26 (55%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (45%) strict anaerobes were obtained. The organisms most commonly cultured were Veillonella species (15%), Streptococcus milleri (11%), Streptococcus sanguis (11%), Actinomyces naeslundii (11%), Propionibacterium acnes (11%), and Bacteroides species (10%). Most of the organisms (96%) were sensitive to either amoxicillin, clindamycin, or tetracycline, whereas only 45% were sensitive to metronidazole.
TI  - Colonization resistance of defined bacterial plaques to Streptococcus mutans implantation on teeth in a model mouth.
AB  - We investigated the ability of Streptococcus mutans C67-1 to colonize simple bacterial plaques and the effects of age and stability of the pre-formed plaque on colonization resistance. Mixed-plaques of Actinomyces viscosus WVU627, 'Streptococcus mitior' LPA-1, and Veillonella dispar OMZ193 were grown on tooth segments, mounted back to back for simulation of approximal sites in a model mouth for 66 h. S. mutans C67-1 was either included in the original inoculum or super-inoculated onto the developing plaque. Inclusion of S. mutans C67-1 did not alter the total viable counts, but the proportional composition changed due to inter-species interactions. Colonization resistance of the mixed-plaque samples developed within 24 h, although S. mutans C67-1 was always able to colonize these stagnation sites. Colonization resistance of 24-hour plaque against a fresh isolate, S. mutans CP3, was also studied. There was greater colonization resistance by the basic plaque to this organism, compared with S. mutans C67-1, although the reasons for this were not clear. These initial experiments demonstrate the way in which the factors involved in bacterial colonization resistance in microbial films on teeth can be studied under controlled conditions.
TI  - Sorbitol-fermenting predominant cultivable flora of human dental plaque in relation to sorbitol adaptation and salivary secretion rate.
AB  - The sorbitol-fermenting predominant flora of human dental plaque was studied in 12 people with low and 11 with normal salivary secretion rates before and after a period of frequent mouth rinses with sorbitol solution. A total of 277 sorbitol-fermenting isolates are described by their morphological and physiological characteristics. The flora was almost exclusively composed of gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces in people with low secretion rates and Streptococcus and Actinomyces in those with normal salivation. At the species level, Streptococcus mutans predominated in all. The frequent use of sorbitol resulted in an increase of the streptococcal species mainly and particularly of Streptococcus sanguis I in people with normal salivation. The counts of lactobacilli and Actinomyces remained unaffected. Almost all isolates appeared to belong to the resident plaque flora. Succession of new sorbitol-fermenting genera to the plaque community could not be observed as a result of the frequent exposure of the mouth to sorbitol.
TI  - An in vitro method to study the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated tooth enamel sections.
AB  - An in vitro bacterial adherence assay which employed human tooth enamel sections  precoated with saliva and an epifluorescent staining technique with acridine orange was developed. The assay was used to study the adherence properties of fresh and type strains of the following oral bacterial species: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Capnocytophaga species, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus species, Veillonella species, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis. Approximately half of the bacteria tested adhered well to enamel, including the fresh isolates of B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, Veillonella species and S. sanguis. Adherence did not correlate in all cases with the known distribution of these species in vivo. Three-quarters of the fresh strains adhered better than the type strains of the same species. The assay method is an alternative to the widely used hydroxyapatite bead assay.
TI  - Complete structure of the polysaccharide from Streptococcus sanguis J22.
AB  - The cell wall polysaccharides of certain oral streptococci such as Streptococcus  sanguis strains 34 and J22, although immunologically distinct, act as receptors for the fimbrial lectins of Actinomyces viscosus T14V. We report the complete covalent structure of the polysaccharide from S. sanguis J22 which is composed of a heptasaccharide subunit linked by phosphodiester bonds. The repeating subunit, which contains alpha-GalNAc, alpha-rhamnose, beta-rhamnose, beta-glucose, and beta-galactose all in the pyranoside form and beta-galactofuranose, is compared with the previously published structure of the polysaccharide from strain 34. The structure has been determined almost exclusively by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the polysaccharides from both strains 34 and J22 have been completely assigned. The stereochemistry of pyranosides was assigned from JH-H values determined from phase-sensitive COSY spectra, and acetamido sugars were assigned by correlation of the resonances of the amide 1H with the sugar ring protons. The 13C spectra were assigned by 1H-detected multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC) spectra, and the assignments were confirmed by 1H-detected multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) spectra. The positions of the glycosidic linkages were assigned by detection of three-bond 1H-13C correlation across the glycosidic linkage in the HMBC spectra. The positions of the phosphodiester linkages were determined by splittings observed in the 13C resonances due to 31P coupling and also by 1H-detected 31P correlation spectroscopy.
TI  - Cellular coaggregation of oral Streptococcus milleri with actinomyces.
AB  - Oral isolates of Streptococcus milleri were examined for their ability to coaggregate with actinomyces. Of the 68 S. milleri strains tested, including 3 reference strains, 40 strains coaggregated with Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45 (actinomyces coaggregation group B) and 36 strains coaggregated with Actinomyces viscosus T14V (actinomyces coaggregation group A). All S. milleri strains of serotypes b (4 strains), e (2 strains), and f (24 strains) coaggregated with both of the actinomyces. The coaggregation reactions between the S. milleri cells and A. naeslundii WVU45 cells were optimal at about pH 7.0 and were Ca2+ or Mg2+ dependent, but they were not inhibited by the presence of simple sugars or amino sugars, including lactose (up to 0.5 M). Treatment of the S. milleri cells with heat (100 degrees C, 3 min) or proteases (trypsin, 1.0 mg/ml; pronase, 0.25 mg/ml; 37 degrees C; 3 h) and of the actinomyces cells with periodate (0.01 M, 4 degrees C, 16 h) destroyed their coaggregating abilities. The coaggregations between cells of the S. milleri strains, we well as cells of the Streptococcus sanguis H1 (reference strain for streptococcus coaggregation group 2) and the actinomyces strains (WVU45 and T14V), were inhibited by AFH1 (a carbohydrate receptor on T14V cells for a lectin on H1 cells). These interactions were also inhibited by anti-AFH1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and by anti-b, anti-e, and anti-f S. milleri IgG or anti-f IgG Fab fragments. These results suggest that S. milleri, at least strains of serotypes b, e, and f, belongs to streptococcus coaggregation group 2.
TI  - Effect of pH on acid production from sorbitol in washed cell suspensions of oral  bacteria.
AB  - The acid production from sorbitol and glucose was studied under anaerobic conditions in resting cell suspensions of bacteria from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora, belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. The acid production activity of the bacterial cells was followed by titration with alkali, at environmental pH 7.0, 6.0 and 5.0 after addition of carbohydrate solution. The metabolic end products formed in the suspensions were analyzed thereafter by isotachophoretic and enzymatic methods. The results showed that sorbitol was fermented at a slower rate than glucose. Lowering the environmental pH decreased the acid production activity from the two carbohydrates. Compared with glucose, the catabolism of sorbitol was affected to greater extent by the pH conditions. The total amount of acids formed from sorbitol was considerably less than from glucose. Lactic acid, which was the major end product in glucose-challenged suspensions, was produced only in low concentrations from sorbitol by all strains tested. The ratio strong (formic + lactic)/weak acids was moreover lower for sorbitol than for glucose. The present results further illustrate some of the mechanisms behind the low cariogenic potential of this sugar substitute.
TI  - Identification of the rhamnose-sensitive adhesin of Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC  33596.
AB  - The coaggregation of the Gram-negative microorganism Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 with several Gram-positive bacteria, including streptococci, actinomyces and rothia, is mediated by rhamnose-sensitive adhesin(s). In the present study, MAbs against the C. ochracea adhesin(s) were prepared. These antibodies inhibited all the rhamnose-sensitive interactions, indicating that they recognize epitopes at or near the rhamnose binding site of the adhesin. The monoclonals served as probes in immunoblot analysis and recognized a polypeptide of Mr 155 K present in the wild-type organism but absent in a coaggregation defective mutant. It is concluded that the rhamnose-sensitive interactions of C. ochracea are mediated by a 155 K Mr polypeptide present on its outer surface.
TI  - Glucanase-producing organisms in human dental plaques.
AB  - Selective media were used to isolate a wide range of bacteria from sixty human dental plaques. Glucanase activities of the isolates were determined on dextran- and starch-containing media. All sixty samples of dental plaque yielded some colonies showing amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. The glucanase-producing organisms comprised 20% of the isolates. Of these 38% were Gram-positive rods, 27% Gram-positive cocci, 28% Gram-negative rods and 7% were Gram-negative cocci. The cultural groups most commonly represented among the glucanase-producing isolates were Actinomycetaceae, streptococci, haemophili and Gram-negative anaerobes. Species prominent among these isolates included Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Bifidobacterium sp. and Bacteroides sp. No isolates capable of degrading starch or dextran were identified as Streptococcus milleri, Rothia dentocariosa or Fusobacterium sp. This study has shown that a wide range of bacterial species commonly isolated from human dental plaques exhibit both amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. In order to understand glucan metabolism in human dental plaques further investigation of these catabolic activities is necessary.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Effects of varnishes containing chlorhexidine on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  - This study describes the effects of varnishes containing 0%, 10%, 20%, or 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on the microflora of human fissure dental plaque. Sandarac, a natural resin, was used as the varnish base. Ten subjects, each with at least four sound fissures harboring high levels of Streptococcus mutans, participated in the study. The fissures in each of the individuals were randomly assigned to four experimental groups, in each of which one of the varnishes was tested. The varnish treatment consisted of a single application of a small amount of varnish onto the fissures. Apart from the selected fissures, the rest of the dentition was left untreated. All chlorhexidine-containing varnishes selectively suppressed S. mutans in fissure plaque, and had no effect on total viable counts or on the numbers of Actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguis beyond one week. The extent of the suppression depended upon the concentration of chlorhexidine in the varnish, 40% chlorhexidine varnish giving the greatest suppression of S. mutans. At 22 weeks, after a single treatment with varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine, mean S. mutans counts were more than ten times lower than in the control or 10%-chlorhexidine varnish group. At that time, S. mutans was still undetectable in five out of ten experimental fissures in this group. The results suggested that sandarac varnishes containing high concentrations of chlorhexidine can be used successfully for long-term suppression of S. mutans in dental fissures.
TI  - The microflora associated with the development of initial enamel decalcification  below orthodontic bands in vivo in children living in a fluoridated-water area.
AB  - Thirty-four caries-free teeth destined for orthodontic extraction were banded to  provide a protected area for the accumulation of plaque. The teeth were extracted at one, two, four, eight, and 14 days after being banded, and samples of the flora below the band were analyzed for the presence of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus 'mitior', 'mutans streptococci', Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus species, and Veillonella. After plaque sampling, the teeth were sent to the Royal Dental College (Copenhagen) for histological analysis. The results showed that S. mutans could colonize the area below the band after one day, but that colonization was only 100% at 14 days. Lactobacillus was only isolated from 2/8 samples at four days and from 4/8 samples at 14 days. S. sanguis and 'S. mitior' were regularly isolated at all banding times, and Veillonella was isolated from all samples. A. viscosus was the most commonly isolated Actinomyces. The numbers of Streptococcus and Veillonella were significantly higher at day 1 than at day 14 (p less than 0.05). S. mutans and A. viscosus were isolated more frequently at day 14 than at day 1 (p less than 0.01). Histological examination revealed that dissolution of the enamel below a band could occur after two days, but that even after 14 days dissolution could be questionable. Dissolution was detected in areas where S. mutans was not isolated (8/34), but S. mutans was also present in samples showing dissolution (12/34). There was no relationship between dissolution and the numbers of S. mutans; however, the isolation frequency of S. mutans was associated with dissolution (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteroides loeschei PK1295 cells express two distinct adhesins simultaneously.
AB  - Bacteroides loeschei synthesizes two distinct adhesins that mediate its coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguis 34 and Actinomyces israeli PK14. Streptococcal adhesin-specific and actinomyces adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to prepare antibody-coated 5- or 10-nm gold particles. These were used in immunoelectron microscopic studies to establish that essentially all bacteroides cells in a population express both adhesins. In general, the two sizes of gold particles representing each type of adhesin appeared to be spatially separated on neighboring fimbriae of B. loeschei. Deposition of antibody-coated gold particles, representing both types of adhesin, at or near the same fimbria was observed less frequently.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of a type 1 fimbrial gene of Streptococcus sanguis FW213.
AB  - A structural gene for type 1 fimbriae of Streptococcus sanguis FW213 was located  within a 6-kilobase fragment cloned in Escherichia coli. A 1.6-kilobase internal fragment contains an open reading frame of 927 bases coding for an immunoreactive peptide of 34,349 daltons, which corresponds in size with an observed cytoplasmic form of fimbrial peptide (P. M. Fives-Taylor, F. L. Macrina, T. J. Pritchard, and S. J. Peene, Infect. Immun. 55:123-128, 1987). Disruption of the reading frame by insertional mutagenesis results in loss of immunoreactivity. Consensus sequences for initiation of transcription and translation were identified 5' to the coding region. Transcription terminator-like sequences were found downstream of the coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned fimbrial peptide shows a strongly hydrophobic signal sequence at the amino terminus. The carboxyl-terminal region does not include a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence such as has been reported for other gram-positive surface structures. A hydrophobic region of 12 to 14 amino acids downstream from the putative signal sequence cleavage site exhibits homology with the Streptococcus pyogenes type 6 M protein repetitive region A (S. K. Hollingshead, V. A. Fischetti, and J. R. Scott, J. Biol. Chem., 261:1677-1686, 1986). Functional homology at the level of protein secondary structure with Actinomyces viscosus T14V type 1 fimbriae (M. K. Yeung, B. M. Chassy, and J. O. Cisar, J. Bacteriol., 169:1678-1683, 1987) is proposed.
TI  - An in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  - The difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. This investigation assessed the antibacterial and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. The microorganisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, Actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary organisms, and Candida albicans. The results showed an absence of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. It is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.
TI  - Characterization of salivary alpha-amylase binding to Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major salivary components which interact with oral bacteria and to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for their binding to the bacterial surface. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus were incubated for 2 h in freshly collected human submandibular-sublingual saliva (HSMSL) or parotid saliva (HPS), and bound salivary components were eluted with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western transfer, alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) was the prominent salivary component eluted from S. sanguis. Studies with 125I-labeled HSMSL or 125I-labeled HPS also demonstrated a component with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of alpha-amylase which bound to S. sanguis. Purified alpha-amylase from human parotid saliva was radiolabeled and found to bind to strains of S. sanguis genotypes 1 and 3 and S. mitis genotype 2, but not to strains of other species of oral bacteria. Binding of [125I]alpha-amylase to streptococci was saturable, calcium independent, and inhibitable by excess unlabeled alpha-amylases from a variety of sources, but not by secretory immunoglobulin A and the proline-rich glycoprotein from HPS. Reduced and alkylated alpha-amylase lost enzymatic and bacterial binding activities. Binding was inhibited by incubation with maltotriose, maltooligosaccharides, limit dextrins, and starch.
TI  - Fimbria-associated adhesin of Bacteroides loeschei that recognizes receptors on procaryotic and eucaryotic cells.
AB  - Inhibition studies with a set of adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies and various sugars revealed that a fimbria-associated adhesin of Bacteroides loeschei recognizes receptors on both procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. These interactions permit this bacterium to attach to both types of cells, producing coaggregates in the presence of strains of Streptococcus sanguis and hemagglutination in the presence of neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes.
TI  - The complete structure of the capsular polysaccharide from Streptococcus sanguis  34.
AB  - A complete structure for the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus sanguis 34, which is responsible for coaggregation of this bacterium with Actinomyces viscosus T14V, an important step in the formation of dental plaque, is proposed, based partly on the 1H-n.m.r. spectrum, which was assigned by 2-dimensional COSY, homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy, and nuclear Overhauser effects. A phosphoric diester linkage was identified from the 31P-n.m.r. spectrum, and the linkage was determined from long range 1H-31P correlation spectroscopy. The proposed structure is supported both by methylation analysis before and after dephosphorylation and by g.l.c.-m.s. of the phosphorylated monosaccharides as their trimethylsilyl derivatives, isolated by partial hydrolysis of the polysaccharide. The structure is composed of repeating linear hexasaccharide units joined by a phosphoric diester linkage, i.e., [----PO4(-)----6)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1----3)-beta-L-Rhap-(1----4)-be ta -D-Glcp- (1----6)-beta-D-Galf-(1----6)-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1----3)-alpha-D-Galp -(1----]n.

TI  - Root canal microflora: qualitative changes after endodontic instrumentation.
AB  - The changes in the pattern of bacteria in root canal after repeated washing with  NaOCl and endodontic instrumentation were evaluated. Samples were obtained from the root canals of patients before and after endodontic instrumentation, and analyzed according to the usual microbiological techniques. Washing with NaOCl and endodontic instrumentation act against bacteria such as Peptostreptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides, whereas Streptococcus lactis and Aerococcus were present before and after endodontic instrumentation. Environmental conditions such as low pH could be responsible for the persistence of gram-positive bacteria. The use of topical treatment and the associated endodontic instrumentation seem useful in the eradication of some bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Detachment of oral bacteria from saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) demonstrated the ability to detach Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguis from saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (SHA). Between 60 to 80% of bacteria were detached within 1 hour at PMN-to-bacteria ratios between 1:10 to 1:22. Detachment was enhanced by treating bacteria with fresh but not heat-inactivated normal human serum. Detachment of serum-treated A. viscosus was inhibited by cytochalasin B, L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and deoxyglucose but not colchicine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), N-carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (ZPCK), and sodium azide. In the absence of serum treatment, the detachment of A. viscosus was insensitive to lactose, galactose, and mannose. We conclude that PMN can efficiently detach bacteria from SHA, this detachment is enhanced by serum, and this enhancement is probably dependent upon complement. Additionally, detachment of A. viscosus bound to SHA by PMN (1) does not appear to involve bacterial lectin activity, (2) seems to be dependent upon glycolytic metabolism, microfilament formation, and the activity of a TPCK-sensitive serine protease, and (3) is not sensitive to inhibitors of tubulin polymerization or heme-protein activity.
TI  - Aggregation of 27 oral bacteria by human whole saliva. Influence of culture medium, calcium, and bacterial cell concentration, and interference by autoaggregation.
AB  - Twenty-seven oral strains of the genera Actinomyces (5), Bacteroides (3), and Streptococcus (19) were tested for aggregation by human whole saliva, as well as the effect of culture medium, Ca-ions, and bacteria concentration thereupon. Of the media tested, GF-broth gave rise to less interference by autoaggregation or higher aggregation titers than BHI and TSB, and was used throughout this study. In most cases, Ca-ions (1 mM) only enhanced the rate of induced aggregation, whereas raising the bacteria concentration increased the rate of both induced- and autoaggregation. The final titers, ranging from 1-64, were hardly affected by these parameters, except those of S. rattus HG 59 and S. mutans HG 199, which were respectively increased and decreased by Ca-ions. Saliva-induced aggregation was observed for 21 strains of A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. israelii, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, S. cricetus, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. sanguis, and S. sobrinus, mostly within 15 min to 3 h. Seventeen of these strains also showed autoaggregation, usually well after the onset of induced aggregation. Any potential induced aggregation of B. gingivalis HG 91 was always masked by autoaggregation, as well as that of the S. mutans strains under a particular set of conditions. The aggregation rate and titer varied considerably in a mutually unrelated and strain-dependent way. These microtiterplate data were matched by the 5 spectrophotometric patterns observed for saliva-bacterial interaction, which moreover, gave the better differentiation between induced and autoaggregation. In conclusion, most strains tested can show rapid saliva-induced aggregation in a strain-dependent way, yet strongly affected by the experimental conditions and interference from autoaggregation.
TI  - Effects of sustained-release chlorhexidine acetate on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect on the human dental plaque flora of a varnish containing chlorhexidine diacetate. The in vitro release of chlorhexidine acetate from the varnish preparation was relatively fast on the first day, followed by a substantial decline in the subsequent three days. In a clinical experiment, 26 volunteers were randomly distributed over four experimental groups. After a dental prophylaxis, the subjects were treated with a single application of a placebo varnish (group I), a fluoride varnish (group II), a chlorhexidine varnish (group III), or a fluoride-plus-chlorhexidine varnish (group IV). Saliva and pooled plaque samples from approximal surfaces were taken before (baseline) and one, two, three, four, and six weeks after the treatments. No suppression was found of total cultivable flora or S. sanguis after the experimental treatments. Application of the fluoride varnish did not suppress the A. viscosus/naeslundii or S. mutans levels in the dental plaque. Chlorhexidine suppressed A. viscosus/naeslundii until two weeks after the treatment. S. mutans was significantly suppressed until four weeks after a single chlorhexidine application. While in some subjects S. mutans was effectively suppressed over the whole experimental period, in others S. mutans recovered quickly. In five subjects in whom S. mutans recovered quickly, the dentition was treated twice with chlorhexidine varnish, with an interval of one week between the treatments. After two chlorhexidine treatments, S. mutans in saliva and on the teeth was suppressed more strongly than after a single treatment. However, the second chlorhexidine treatment could not prevent the return of S. mutans in the approximal areas to its original level.
TI  - Comparison of different assays for the aggregation of oral bacteria by human whole saliva.
AB  - For comparison, human whole saliva-induced aggregation was studied by phase-contrast microscopy, spectrophotometry combined with macroscopic observations, and in microtiterplate assay under identical experimental conditions for Actinomyces viscosus HG 85 (T14-V) and HG 380 (T14-AV), Bacteroides gingivalis HG 66 (W 83), Streptococcus rattus HG 59 (BHT), and Streptococcus sanguis I HG 169. The entire process of formation, extension, and sedimentation of aggregates could merely be observed by the combination of these assays. The very first stages of aggregation could only be detected and quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy. Within 2 1/2 min, 50% of the A. viscosus, S. rattus, and S. sanguis cells were aggregated, denoted as T50. In microtiterplates, however, aggregates were observed in general only after sedimentation at 30-45 min of incubation, expressed as TA. For interpretation of the spectrophotometric curves, additional microscopic and macroscopic data were a prerequisite. The small decline in absorbance during the first 30-45 min (phase 1) corresponded to the formation and extension of nonsedimenting aggregates, whereas the subsequent pronounced fall in absorbance (phase 2) was caused by the massive sedimentation of aggregates. The moment of inflexion between both phases, TI, marked the onset of sedimentation of aggregates and corresponded very well with TA, at which time already 92-98% of the cells were aggregated as quantitated by microscopy. In conclusion, only by microscopy the formation and extension of aggregates could be observed within a few minutes and quantitated in terms of aggregation rate. From 30-45 min, merely the sedimentation of aggregates was visualized in microtiterplates, whereas the time course of the overall process was recorded indirectly by spectrophotometry.
TI  - A study of in vitro attachment of Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus  to saliva-treated titanium.
AB  - This study examined the initial attachment of Streptococcus sanguis G9-B and Actinomyces viscosus T14V to saliva-treated powdered enamel and titanium surfaces. Using an in vitro adherence model, significantly lower numbers of Actinomyces viscosus T14V bound to the saliva-treated titanium surface when compared to that of the similarly treated enamel. The binding of Streptococcus sanguis G9-B to titanium or enamel did not vary significantly. A comparison of the percentage of cells bound to the titanium surface revealed that S sanguis cells attached in significantly higher numbers when compared to the A viscosus cells.
TI  - Surface structures, co-aggregation and adherence phenomena of Streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  - Seven strains of Streptococcus oralis were found to possess surface structures. Four strains possessed long fimbriae which ranged in length from 266-366 nm, while the remaining three strains possessed shorter peritrichously distributed fibrils which ranged in length from 80-197 nm. The fibrillar strains were morphologically similar to strains of Streptococcus sanguis I and II and Streptococcus mitis. No strain of S. oralis produced tufts of fibrils like certain strains of S. sanguis I. Strains of Streptococcus milleri produced peritrichously distributed fimbriae which were morphologically dissimilar to the fimbriae produced by S. oralis strains. S. oralis strains were moderately to highly hydrophobic, but hydrophobicity could not be related to adhesion parameters or type or length or density of surface structures. Furthermore, there appeared to be no correlation between type of surface structures and adhesion parameters. Two of the three fibrillar strains of S. oralis and the peritrichously fibrillar strains of S. sanguis, together with one strain of S. milleri, were able to co-aggregate with actinomycetes.
TI  - Effect of hemoglobin and of ferric ammonium citrate on the virulence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  - Physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion to intact dental tissue slabs. In addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. Strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, A. viscosus, and A. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mJ.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. Very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. Powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in the physiological buffer. The surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. The adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.
TI  - Specific and nonspecific inhibition of adhesion of oral actinomyces and streptococci to erythrocytes and polystyrene by caseinoglycopeptide derivatives.
AB  - Various caseinoglycopeptide derivatives prepared from mammalian milk were evaluated as inhibitors of hemagglutinations mediated by Actinomyces viscosus Ny1, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, and, for comparative purposes, plant lectins from Arachis hypogaea and Bauhinia purpurea. It was found that recognition of the beta-D-galactose-(1----3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose carbohydrate chain by Actinomyces viscosus Ny1 organisms and Arachis hypogaea and B. purpurea agglutinins had similar structural requirements; in all cases, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide, on which several units of the above mentioned disaccharide are clustered, behaved as the most potent hemagglutination inhibitor. By contrast, none of the preparations tested inhibited erythrocyte agglutination by S. sanguis OMZ9. Thus, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of oral Actinomyces adhesion to cell membranes (a soft surface) and could be used as a probe for the study of recognition mechanisms mediated by Actinomyces galactose-binding lectins. During the present study, both native and desialylated variants of the same bovine glycomacropeptide also totally prevented the adhesion of Actinomyces viscosus Ny1, S. sanguis OMZ9, and S. mutans OMZ176 to polystyrene surfaces. Comparative evaluations of various structurally different compounds gave the following results. Neither mono- nor disaccharides related to caseinoglycopeptide carbohydrates prevented adhesion; highly positively or negatively charged polypeptides and polysaccharides were either not or only moderately active. Besides these glycomacropeptides, an inhibitory activity was also exhibited by other mucin-type glycoproteins carrying short O-linked carbohydrate chains (including bovine submaxillary mucin), polyethylene glycol, and bovine serum albumin. Consequently, caseinoglycopeptide prevention of oral bacterial adhesion to polystyrene tubes (a hard surface) takes place with no species specificity and can be compared to nonspecific inhibition exhibited by various polymers with very different structural characteristics.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - Coaggregation of Eikenella corrodens with oral bacteria mediated by bacterial lectin-like substance.

TI  - Mutants of Actinomyces viscosus T14V lacking type 1, type 2, or both types of fimbriae.
AB  - Mutants of Actinomyces viscosus T14V lacking type 1 or type 2 fimbriae or both were selected by their failure to react with rabbit antibodies against either or both fimbrial antigens. Immunospecific double labeling with iron dextran and ferritin-conjugated antibodies showed two types of fimbriae on individual cells of the parent organism, a single type on mutant strains with type 1+2- and type 1-2+ fimbriae and no labeled or unlabeled fimbriae on a type 1-2- fimbria-deficient strain. The mutational loss of one fimbrial antigen did not appear to affect expression of the other, since bacteria with one or two types of fimbriae bound similar amounts of a monoclonal antibody directed against the fimbrial antigen present on both bacterial phenotypes. The strong adsorption of strains with type 1+2+ or 1+2- fimbriae to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite and weak adsorption of those with type 1-2+ or no fimbriae was consistent with the known involvement of type 1 fimbriae in this attachment process. Similarly, the A. viscosus lectin was clearly associated with the expression of type 2 fimbriae, since only the strains with type 1+2+ or 1-2+ fimbriae participated in lactose-sensitive coaggregations with Streptococcus sanguis 34. Further studies using the fimbria-deficient mutant strains showed that aggregation of A. viscosus T14V in the presence of sialidase-treated human saliva involved both types of fimbriae, whereas neither type was required for the lactose-resistant coaggregation of the organism with certain streptococcal strains.
TI  - Relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. The sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. All clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. Certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. The combination of F. nucleatum, B. forsyth and W. recta (cluster VII) or B. gingivalis, B. intermedius and S. intermedius (cluster VIII) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. These clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. Clusters dominated by V. parvula (cluster III), the Actinomyces sp. (cluster X) or the combination of S. sanguis II, S. mitis, V. parvula and S. intermedius (cluster II) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more favorably to therapy. Sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Coaggregation properties of human oral Veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  - The primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. Isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. All 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were Veillonella atypica or Veillonella dispar. All but one of them coaggregated with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. These tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the subgingival flora such as Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Streptococcus sanguis. In contrast, 24 of 29 Veillonella isolates, of which 20 were Veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of Actinomyces, S. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with S. salivarius. The majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. These results indicate that the three human oral Veillonella species are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.
TI  - A polysaccharide from Streptococcus sanguis 34 that inhibits coaggregation of S.  sanguis 34 with Actinomyces viscosus T14V.
AB  - Coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Streptococcus sanguis 34 depends on interaction of a lectin on A. viscosus T14V with a cell surface carbohydrate on S. sanguis 34. This carbohydrate was isolated, and its chemical makeup was established. The carbohydrate remained attached to S. sanguis 34 cells through extraction with Triton X-100 and treatment with pronase. It was cleaved from the cell residue by autoclaving and purified by differential centrifugation and column chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-75. The polysaccharide contained phosphate which was neither inorganic nor monoester. Treatment with NaOH-NaBH4, followed by Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, or with 48% HF at 4 degrees C, followed by NaBH4, yielded inorganic phosphate and oligosaccharide alditols. Therefore, the polysaccharide is composed of oligosaccharide units joined together by phosphodiester bridges. The structure and stereochemistry of the main oligosaccharide alditol was established previously (F. C. McIntire, C. A. Bush, S.-S. Wu, S.-C. Li, Y.-T. Li, M. McNeil, S. Tjoa, and P. V. Fennessey, Carbohydr. Res. 166:133-143). Permethylation analysis, 1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the whole polysaccharide revealed the position of the phosphodiester linkages. The polysaccharide is mainly a polymer of (6) GalNAc(alpha 1-3)Rha(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-6)Galf(beta 1-6)GalNAc(beta 1- 3)Gal(alpha 1)-OPO3. It reacted as a single antigen with antiserum to S. sanguis 34 cells and was a potent inhibitor of coaggregation between A. viscosus T14V and S. sanguis 34. Quantitative inhibition of precipitation assays with oligosaccharides, O-allyl N-acetylgalactosaminides, and simple sugars indicated that specific antibodies were directed to the GalNAc end of the hexasaccharide unit. In contrast, coaggregation was inhibited much more effectively by saccharides containing betaGalNAc. Thus, the specificity of the A. viscosus T14V lectin is strikingly different from that of antibodies directed against the S. sanguis 34 polysaccharide.
TI  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. Active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". The predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. Among the 33 subjects, W. recta, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, B. gingivalis and B. forsythus were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, S. mitis, C. ochracea, S. sanguis II, V. parvula and an unnamed Actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. The likelihood of a site being active was increased if B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, P. micros, A. actinomycetemcomitans, W. recta, or B. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if S. sanguis II, the Actinomyces sp., or C. ochracea were detected.
TI  - Intergeneric rosettes: sequestered surface recognition among human periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The human oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis and Bacteroides loescheii, when mixed in equal numbers in vitro, formed large settling coaggregates. As the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. Rosettes consisting of a streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as Actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling multigeneric aggregates. The ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of human periodontal disease.
TI  - Localization and enumeration of fimbria-associated adhesins of Bacteroides loescheii.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies that specifically inhibit coaggregation between Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 and its two gram-positive partners Streptococcus sanguis 34 and Actinomyces israelii PK14 were used to enumerate and localize two distinct types of fimbria-associated adhesins on the surface of B. loescheii. Binding studies with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies indicated that a maximum (Bmax calculated from Scatchard plots) of approximately 400 adhesin molecules specific for S. sanguis and 310 adhesin molecules specific for A. israelii reside on the surface of the cell. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the adhesins were not an integral part of the fimbrial subunit; rather, they were usually found on the distal portion of the structures arranged in a random fashion.
TI  - Microbial flora associated with presence of root surface caries in periodontally  treated patients.
AB  - Examination of saliva and dental plaque was carried out in 35 adults who had been treated for periodontal disease 3 yr earlier. Plaque samples were collected from approximal and buccal sound and carious root surfaces. The samples were analyzed for the presence and proportions of members of Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. The results showed a low prevalence of root surface caries and a low level of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. From subjects with root caries there was a not statistically significant tendency to higher proportional levels of mutans streptococci in plaque from carious root surfaces than from caries-free surfaces. An inverse significant relationship between noncarious and carious root surfaces was noted for S. sanguis. The population of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii was similar in plaque samples from sound and carious sites but showed elevated levels in the subjects with five or more new root surface lesions.
TI  - Degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  - Selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. S. sanguis IUOM-11M and JC804, S. mutans 6715, S. salivarius IUOM-8, A. viscosus IUOM-62, and A. naeslundii ATCC 12104 degraded all four substrates. S. mutans NCTC 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while A. viscosus ATCC 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and S. sanguis SS34 degraded only maltose. L. casei IUOM-14 did not degrade any of the substrates. Analysis of starch degradation products from S. sanguis IUOM-11M and A. viscosus IUOM-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose, and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. S. sanguis IUOM-11M alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a pH optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. The presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. Maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of S. sanguis IUOM-11M insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. Maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. Several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. These products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of the acidogenic substrate fructose. The results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.
TI  - Use of lytic bacteriophage for Actinomyces viscosus T14V as a probe for cell surface components mediating intergeneric coaggregation.
AB  - A lytic bacteriophage for Actinomyces viscosus T14V (the reference strain for actinomyces coaggregation group A) was isolated from raw sewage. This phage, designated BF307, also lysed the T14V-derived nonfimbriated mutant PK455-2 as well as A. viscosus MG-1 and T14AV but not the other serotype 2 or serotype 1 strains of this species that were tested or any of nine Actinomyces naeslundii isolates. Phages BF307 belonged to Bradley morphological group C and was similar in appearance to the A. viscosus MG-1 phages Av-1 and Av-3, which do not productively infect A. viscosus T14V. A. viscosus MG-1 mutants selected for resistance to phage BF307, Av-3, or CT7 (a human dental plaque isolate with the same host range as BF307) were coresistant to the other two phages but sensitive to Av-1. These results indicate that the receptors on A. viscosus MG-1 for phages BF307, Av-3, and CT7 are identical or share a common precursor and that the receptor for phage Av-1 is distinct. Comparison of the genomes of BF307, Av-3, and CT7 revealed that their DNAs were similar in size but distinguishable by restriction analysis. Two altered coaggregation phenotypes were identified among the phage BF307-resistant mutants of strains MG-1, T14V, T14AV, and PK455-2. Class I mutants had lost the ability to interact with coaggregation group 1 streptococci, and class II mutants did not coaggregate with either group 1 or group 2 streptococci. These results are consistent with the proposal that the phage BF307 receptor on these A. viscosus strains is related to one of the structures that mediates coaggregation with oral streptococci. A model to delineate the various coaggregation mediators on the surface of actinomyces coaggregation group A cells is presented, and the use of these phages to probe surface components of human oral actinomyces strains is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. Mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. Reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with the saline/buffer controls. A significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, and Candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. Five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to S. mutans, A. viscosus and S. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to S. salivarius.Five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.The results indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. The exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.
TI  - Characterization of monoclonal antibodies to fimbria-associated adhesins of Bacteroides loescheii PK1295.
AB  - Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 fimbriae, which mediate the lactose-sensitive coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguis 34 and the lactose-insensitive coaggregation with Actinomyces israelii PK14, were injected into mice to raise adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Supernatants of hybridomas were screened for the capacity to inhibit coaggregation and agglutinate intact bacteria. Of the 10 MAbs that were isolated, 4 were specific and potent inhibitors of the coaggregation between B. loescheii and S. sanguis and two other MAbs specifically inhibited the B. loescheii-A. israelii interaction. None of the six MAbs which inhibited adherence were capable of agglutinating whole cells of B. loescheii, whereas the four remaining MAbs agglutinated whole cells but had no effect on coaggregation. Fab fragments of two MAbs, one that inhibited the coaggregation with S. sanguis and another that inhibited the interaction with A. israelii, also were shown to inhibit the respective coaggregation interactions, suggesting that each of the immunoglobulins recognized its adhesin molecule at or near the active sites. By immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation, the S. sanguis adhesin-specific MAbs reacted with a 75-kilodalton polypeptide present in fimbria-enriched preparations, whereas the A. israelii adhesin-specific MAbs recognized a 45-kilodalton polypeptide in the same preparations. By screening hybridoma supernatants directly for their capacity to block coaggregation, we isolated MAbs which were used to establish that the B. loescheii-S. sanguis and the B. loescheii-A. israelii interactions were mediated by different adhesins.
TI  - Microbiology of the early colonization of human enamel and root surfaces in vivo.
AB  - This study describes the predominant early microflora on human teeth on the basis of microbiologic identification of 1742 fresh isolates. The isolates were obtained from four dental students who carried test pieces of enamel and root surface in the oral cavity for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. During the experimental periods oral hygiene was discontinued. Under equal conditions root surfaces were more heavily colonized than were enamel surfaces. However, the composition of the microbiota was the same. Within the first 24 h the microflora was dominated by streptococci and Gram-positive pleomorphic rods. S. sanguis contributed only 6-18% of the early colonizers whereas S. mitis and S. oralis varied between 24-42% and 1-27% (mean values), respectively. The relative proportion of S. oralis increased significantly within the observation period while the proportion of S. salivarius and arginine-positive S. mitis showed a declining tendency. Actinomyces species adsorbed to the tooth surfaces within the first 4 h but did not increase their relative proportions until after 8-12 h, possibly due to a long doubling time. In one individual, encapsulated bacteria resembling Stomatococcus mucilaginosus were observed among the early colonizers. The time-dependent shifts in the bacterial populations within 24 h corroborate parallel ultrastructural findings.
TI  - Microbial aspects of preventive regimes in patients with overdentures.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test effects of preventive regimes using fluoride and chlorhexidine to prevent caries and periodontal diseases in 34 patients with overdentures. The patients, who were treated with immediate overdentures, were distributed at random into three experimental groups. In these groups, different gels--a placebo, a fluoride, and a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel--were tested by daily application. Supragingival plaque samples from selected surfaces of two abutment teeth were taken at one week, and at one, three, and six months after initial insertion of the overdenture. The placebo and fluoride gel influenced neither total CFU nor S. sanguis and A. viscosus/naeslundii counts. In the placebo group, but not in the fluoride group, S. mutans levels increased significantly, indicating the caries risk involved in overdentures. The use of chlorhexidine-fluoride gel resulted in a long-term suppression of total CFU. Further, S. mutans was found to be selectively suppressed to below detection level. A. viscosus/naeslundii was initially strongly suppressed, but after three months a partial return of the population was noticed. S. sanguis was relatively insensitive to the chlorhexidine-fluoride gel. It is concluded that a daily application of a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel is effective against plaque formation and S. mutans on abutment teeth in overdentures.
TI  - Relationship between dental plaque indices and bacteria in dental plaque and those in saliva.
AB  - A variety of indices has been developed for the quantitation of dental plaque. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the Loe plaque index and the number of bacteria on the same tooth. Furthermore, the effect of plaque accumulation on the salivary counts of some dental plaque organisms was estimated. Twenty volunteers were asked to abstain from all oral hygiene for a one-week period. Clinical indices and bacteriological samples were taken at the start and at the end of the experimental period. After an interval of seven days, the experiment was repeated. The relationship between the Loe plaque index and the total bacterial counts on the same area of the tooth was found to be highly significant. After seven days without oral hygiene, the total counts and the Actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguis counts in dental plaque had increased by approximately two log units, while the Streptococcus mutans counts had increased by more than one log unit. The large increase in the number of bacteria on the teeth was reflected in the salivary counts of the Actinomyces species, but not in the S. sanguis or S. mutans counts. This was due to differences in ecological habitats of these species in the mouth. Highly significant correlations were found between the S. mutans level in dental plaque and the salivary level, and between the S. mutans counts of the subjects in the first and second trials of the experiment.
TI  - Molecular basis of bacterial adhesion in the oral cavity.
AB  - The two varieties of fimbriae identified on oral strains of actinomyces have distinct functional properties. The type 1 fimbriae of Actinomyces viscosus T14V mediate attachment to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Type 2 fimbriae--on A. viscosus and the only fimbriae detected on A. naeslundii WVU45--are associated with lectin activity. Interaction of these fimbriae with complementary receptors initiates bacterial attachment to Streptococcus sanguis 34 and sialidase-treated epithelial cells and the killing of actinomyces by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and related oligosaccharides inhibit these processes, and mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae do not participate in them. The actinomyces lectin is similar to lectins from Ricinus communis and Bauhinia purpurea that agglutinate certain strains of oral streptococci, block attachment of actinomyces to epithelial cells, and inhibit killing of actinomyces by PMNs. The S. sanguis receptor for the actinomyces lectin comprises repeating hexasaccharide units with GalNAc termini. Used as probes, the peanut agglutinin, with specificity for Gal(beta-3)GalNAc, and the lectin from B. purpurea detect a 160-kilodalton (kdal) band in SDS-PAGE-separated epithelial cell extracts and a 100-kdal band in PMN extracts. These may be receptors for type 2 fimbriae. A. viscosus genes encoding subunits of types 1 and 2 fimbriae have been cloned in Escherichia coli; the type 1 subunit is 65 kdal and the type 2 subunit is 59 kdal. Submandibular immunization of mice with a mixture of type 1 and type 2 fimbriae evokes the production of IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva that inhibit in vitro adsorption of A. viscosus to SHA. These antibodies may modulate colonization of teeth by this organism.
TI  - Fimbria-associated proteins of Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 mediate intergeneric  coaggregations.
AB  - Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 serves as a coaggregation bridge between Streptococcus sanguis 34 and Actinomyces israelii PK14, two gram-positive oral bacteria that are otherwise unable to coaggregate. Whereas coaggregation with S. sanguis 34 is inhibited by lactose, no simple sugar was found that inhibited coaggregation with A. israelii PK14. Coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of B. loescheii PK1295 were isolated for the purpose of identifying the surface components responsible for the interaction with each coaggregation partner. Selection for spontaneously occurring Cog- mutants gave rise to two phenotypic classes of mutants. Type I lost the ability to coaggregate with S. sanguis 34, whereas type II failed to coaggregate with either S. sanguis 34 or A. israelii PK14. Purified fimbriae from the parent agglutinated cells of both partners, and agglutination with S. sanguis 34 was inhibited by lactose. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of both a 75- and a 43-kilodalton (kDa) protein associated with parental fimbriae, but only a 43-kDa protein was seen with fimbriae prepared from the type I mutant. Neither polypeptide was found in similar preparations from the type II mutants. Our data suggest that coaggregation of B. loescheii PK1295 with both gram-positive partners is mediated by fimbria-associated proteins present on the surface of the gram-negative organism and that the 75- and 43-kDa polypeptides are responsible for the recognition of S. sanguis 34 and A. israelii PK14 cells, respectively.
TI  - A mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. The advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. The effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (ii) three pulses of CHX (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/L) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. Only L. casei survived the continuous provision of CHX; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to CHX. After each CHX pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. Again, L. casei was least affected, while A. viscosus, B. intermedius, and F. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. Counts of S. mutans were affected more by CHX than those of S. sanguis or S. mitior. The effect of successive pulses of CHX on the viability of some bacteria and on acid production (as measured by pH-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to CHX had occurred. The fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.
TI  - Novobiocin-resistant mutants of Streptococcus sanguis with reduced cell hydrophobicity and defective in coaggregation.
AB  - Mutants of Streptococcus sanguis resistant to novobiocin (NovR-mutants) were isolated after mutagenesis of strain Challis with ethyl methanesulphonate. The resistance phenotype was transferred by DNA-mediated transformation back into the parent strain at high frequency suggesting resistance was due to mutation(s) in a single gene or in closely-linked genes. Cells of NovR-mutants had normal morphology and secreted similar proteins to the wild-type strain. However, mutant cultures had slower growth rates, the mutant cells had reduced hydrophobicity, and they showed a reduced degree of coaggregation with Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. Cell envelopes prepared from NovR-mutants differed from wild-type cell envelopes in that they (a) were impaired in ability to coaggregate with A. viscosus cells, and (b) had altered protein composition as detected by SDS-PAGE. The results suggest that hydrophobic proteins in the cell envelope of S. sanguis may be necessary for coaggregation of this bacterium with actinomycetes.
TI  - Characterization of lectinlike surface components on Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 that mediate coaggregation with gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 and Streptococcus sanguis H1, Actinomyces naeslundii PK984, or Actinomyces israelii PK16 are dependent on specific recognitions between heat-sensitive adhesins on C. ochracea and heat-stable structures (probably carbohydrate-containing receptors) on the surfaces of these gram-positive coaggregation partners. The coaggregation of C. ochracea with each of these three organisms was inhibited by L-rhamnose and D-fucose and to a lesser extent by beta-methyl-galactoside. The reaction with S. sanguis was the most sensitive, while the coaggregation with A. israelii was the least sensitive and was only partially inhibited by each of the sugars that were considered to be effective inhibitors. A more effective inhibition of the coaggregation between C. ochracea and A. israelii was achieved by adding a combination of the 6-deoxysugars and N-acetylneuraminic acid. To further characterize the coaggregations, naturally occurring coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of C. ochracea were obtained from several different selections. Three phenotypically distinct groups of mutants were were isolated. Type 1 mutants failed to coaggregate with S. sanguis only. Type 2 mutants lost ability to interact with both S. sanguis and A. naeslundii. Type 3 mutants failed to coaggregate with all three coaggregation partners. Characterization of the Cog- mutants by sugar inhibition studies made it possible to distinguish three classes of adhesin activity.
TI  - A bacteriocin of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - An inhibitory factor from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 was isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin (actinobacillicin). The bacteriocin was active against Streptococcus sanguis strains, Streptococcus uberis (FDC1), and Actinomyces viscosus T14 as well as other strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including other streptococci and actinomycetes. The activity of this bacteriocin was inhibited by pronase, trypsin, and heat (45 min at 56 degrees C) but not by DNase, RNase, phospholipase, exposure to UV light, or low pH (1.0 to 6.5). Although actinobacillicin markedly inhibited glycolysis in S. sanguis, the primary mechanism of its bactericidal action appears to be alterations in cell permeability, with the resultant leakage of RNA, DNA, and other essential intracellular macromolecules. These findings provide an ecologic explanation for the reciprocal growth relationship between A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sanguis/Actinomyces viscosus observed in localized juvenile periodontitis.
TI  - Interbacterial adhesion between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and indigenous oral bacteria isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Interbacterial adhesion between strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of  indigenous oral bacteria, both of which were isolated from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, was investigated by the phenomenon of the coaggregation reaction. A total of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from the oral cavity of 17 patients and examined for their abilities to coaggregate with 5 strains each of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Coaggregation reactions were common between these oral bacteria and both the mucoid and nonmucoid variants of P. aeruginosa. All strains of P. aeruginosa were also able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated or untreated human erythrocytes of blood types A, B, and O. Positive coaggregation reactions were further characterized by determining the effects of several sugars, and of heat and protease treatments of the bacteria. None of the coaggregtion reactions were inhibited by 0.05 M lactose, galactose, glucose, fucose, or mannose. All coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the Pseudomonas. Thus, the interbacterial adhesions between P. aeruginosa and the oral bacteria studied appears to involve adhesins on the Pseudomonas cell, which bind to complementary receptors, on the cell surfaces of oral bacteria. The apparent prevalence and diversity of interbacterial adhesions between P. aeruginosa strains originating from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients and strains of the indigenous oral bacteria suggest that some of these reactions may affect the extent to which P. aeruginosa colonizes in the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, and thereby, influence susceptibility of the host to infection.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Multigeneric aggregations among oral bacteria: a network of independent cell-to-cell interactions.
AB  - A radioactivity-based assay was developed to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in multigeneric aggregates. The cell types in these multigeneric aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. The coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes took part in the more complex multigeneric aggregations. Competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. Attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. However, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to multigeneric aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. This not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for multigeneric aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. Thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of multigeneric aggregates. While the human oral cavity is a prime example of a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Calcium-dependent salivary agglutinin with reactivity to various oral bacterial species.
AB  - Human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of Streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b, c, d, and e and strains of Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis. The desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.154 M sodium chloride. After another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. The L. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. However, all strains, including the nonagglutinating L. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. The agglutinin extracts from S. mutans serotype c, S. sanguis, and A. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. The purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. All agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mM to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. This type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.
TI  - Estimation of growth parameters for some oral bacteria grown in continuous culture under glucose-limiting conditions.
AB  - The coexistence of bacteria in natural environments can often be explained in terms of competition for a growth-limiting substrate(s), and the outcome of such competition depends upon relevant growth parameters such as substrate affinity and yield. Dental plaque bacteria are frequently carbon and energy limited. Growth parameters for seven oral Streptococcus species and one Actinomyces viscosus strain were estimated under glucose-limited conditions in continuous culture. In all strains, mixed-acid fermentation occurred at low growth rates, while amounts of lactate increased at higher growth rates. Two important growth parameters, mumax and Y glucose, were very similar in the two serotype c Streptococcus mutans strains (T8 and Ingbritt), one of the serotype d/g Streptococcus mutans strains (OMZ65), and the two Streptococcus milleri strains (699B3 and B448). Two other serotype d/g S. mutans strains (KIR and B13) were divergent from this group and had lower mumax values and a lower Y glucose. The maintenance energy coefficients were lower in the S. mutans serotype c strains, and the highest values were observed in the S. milleri strains. While A. viscosus had a lower mumax, its lower maintenance rate and significantly higher yield indicate that it deals much more efficiently with glucose than do the streptococci. The most striking feature of amino acid utilization was that arginine was completely consumed by S. milleri strains; similarly, A. viscosus used up all available asparagine as did one of the S. milleri strains at faster growth rates. It is suggested that the ability of strains of S. milleri and S. sanguis to utilize arginine in addition to carbohydrate as a source of energy may explain why such organisms increase in proportion in the plaque of subjects consuming diets almost devoid of fermentable carbohydrate.
TI  - Cell-surface proteins of Streptococcus sanguis associated with cell hydrophobicity and coaggregation properties.
AB  - Incubating cells of Streptococcus sanguis with sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, under  conditions that did not cause lysis, solubilized material comprising 5-8% of the cell dry weight. The treatment reduced cell hydrophobicity, and reduced the ability of the cells to coaggregate with Actinomyces spp. The extract contained about 20 polypeptides and these were identified as being cell-surface components on the basis of one or more of the following criteria: being degraded when cells were incubated with protease; being labelled when cells were iodinated using a lactoperoxidase-catalysed reaction; reacting with antibodies raised to fixed whole cells. Eight of the polypeptides accounted for more than 70% of the total protein extracted, and one component (molecular mass 16 kDa) was hydrophobic. The cell-surface proteins described are implicated in cell hydrophobicity and coaggregation.
TI  - Gingivitis.
AB  - Gingivitis is caused by substances derived from microbial plaque accumulating at  or near the gingival sulcus; all other suspected local and systemic etiologic factors either enhance plaque accumulation or retention, or enhance the susceptibility of the gingival tissue to microbial attack. Microbial species specifically associated with gingival health include Streptococcus sanguis 1, S. D-7, and Fusobacterium naviforme. Bacteria involved in the etiology of gingivitis include specific species of Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Treponema and possibly Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, and Eikenella. Microbial colonization and participation is sequential, with the complexity of the associated flora increasing with time. The pathogenesis has been separated into the initial, early, and established stages, each with characteristic features. The initial lesion is an acute inflammation which can be induced experimentally by application of extracts of plaque bacteria to normal gingiva. The early lesion is characterized by a lymphoid cell infiltrate predominated by T lymphocytes, characteristic of lesions seen at sites of cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. The early lesion can be induced by application of purified contact antigens to the gingival tissues of previously sensitized animals. As the clinical condition worsens, the established lesion appears, predominated by B lymphocytes and plasma cells. Established lesions may remain stable for indefinite periods of time, they may revert, or they may progress. Periodontal destruction does not result from the conversion of a predominantly T cell to a predominantly B cell lesion as has been suggested, but rather from episodes of acute inflammation. Clinical manifestations of gingivitis are episodic phenomena characterized by discontinuous bursts of acute inflammation. Most lesions are transient or persistent but not progressive. Attachment loss may precede alveolar bone loss and may occur without the manifestations of a concurrent or a precursor gingivitis. On the other hand, the evidence indicates that a portion of gingivitis lesions can and does progress to periodontitis. Gingivitis and the periodontal microflora differ in children and adults. Clinical signs of gingivitis either do not appear as plaque accumulates, or they are greatly delayed in children, and the inflammatory infiltrate consists mostly of T lymphocytes. The conversion to a B cell lesion does not appear to occur. The evidence supports the conclusion that gingivitis is a disease, and that control and prevention is a worthwhile goal and a health benefit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of lowering the pH on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  - Nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at D = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. After an initial period of steady-state growth at pH 7.0, pH control was discontinued. The pH then decreased until it stabilized at pH 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the Eh rose from -165 mV to +160 mV. The lowering in pH resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. At pH 7.0, 'Streptococcus mitior', Veillonella alcalescens and S. sanguis were most numerous while at pH 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for Lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. The proportions of S. mutans within the community also increased while S. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and Bacteroides intermedius was not detected below pH 4.6. The survival at pH 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. Relative to pH 7.0, the community growing at pH 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider pH range but amino acid metabolism decreased. In general, when pH control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for B. intermedius, which was still not detected. The inverse relationship between S. sanguis and S. mutans, and the increase in proportions of L. casei and S. mutans during growth in a low pH environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.
TI  - Effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies directed against Streptococcus mutans strain JBP lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were characterized. They were all similarly reactive with the immunizing LTA-containing extract, with intact Strep. mutans JBP cells and with LTA purified from Lactobacillus casei. Immobilized anti-LTA antibodies removes LTA from LTA-containing extracts. The binding of antibodies to LTA was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated LTA, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. Antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of Strep. mutans, as well as with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and L. casei, but not with LTA-negative species Streptococcus mitis or Actinomyces viscosus. Anti-LTA antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of Strep. mutans JBP to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. There was no effect of anti-LTA antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by Strep. mutans. The results argue against a major role for LTA in Strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.
TI  - Enamel demineralization by acid produced from endogenous substrate in oral streptococci.
AB  - Bovine enamel blocks were covered by a bacterial cell mass and held in the mouths of human volunteers by a palatal appliance, to study the effects of acid production from endogenous bacterial substrate on the pH of the mass and on enamel demineralization. Variables were cells with and without endogenous substrate, rinsing with 10 per cent glucose or sucrose solution, or no rinsing and the type of organism. Acid production from endogenous substrate by Streptococcus mutans strain IB-1600, due, at least in part, to intracellular glycogen degradation, caused a marked and prolonged pH drop and significant enamel demineralization. A similar but less marked effect was obtained with a strain of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. Thus acid production from endogenous sources by plaque bacteria may be of importance in the aetiology of dental caries.
TI  - Effects of highly concentrated stannous fluoride and chlorhexidine regimes on human dental plaque flora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an intensive antimicrobial treatment on the number of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus/Actinomyces naeslundii, and the total Colony-forming Units (CFU) in plaque. The dentition of human volunteers was treated in a dental office with either chlorhexidine (5%) or stannous fluoride (8%). Following the office treatment with chlorhexidine, selected volunteers rinsed daily at home for seven or 49 days with chlorhexidine solution (0.2%), while another group flossed daily at home for seven days with dental floss impregnated with chlorhexidine. On days one, seven, 21, 35, and 49 after the local applications, we took saliva samples and plaque samples from fissures, smooth surfaces, and approximal areas. Chlorhexidine and stannous fluoride suppressed S. mutans and the Actinomyces species on all surfaces and in saliva. S. mutans on tooth surfaces was suppressed for approximately seven days and returned to the baseline level at day 21. A. viscosus/naeslundii was suppressed for more than seven days on the teeth. S. sanguis and the total CFU returned to the baseline level within seven days on all surfaces and in saliva. Rinsing or flossing with chlorhexidine suppressed S. mutans during the period of time that these supplements were used. Brushing for seven days with chlorhexidine gel (1%) without a preceding intensive chlorhexidine treatment had virtually no effect on S. mutans in approximal areas and in saliva, but suppressed S. mutans in fissures and on smooth surfaces.
TI  - Immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  - Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified Streptococcus mutans L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. The enzyme affinity for pyruvate or NADH decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. A partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with FDP prior to the antibody adjunction. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when FDP was added. The protective effect observed with FDP could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. A decrease of antibody binding in the presence of FDP was also obtained with S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. NADH did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. On the contrary, pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. A decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.
TI  - Longitudinal microbiological investigation of a hospitalized population of older  adults with a high root surface caries risk.
AB  - Intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. Bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. Microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. S. mutans, S. sanguis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and Veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. The microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. Streptococci, especially S. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  - In this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. The patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. The bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. Periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus and S. mutans and significantly lower proportions of B. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. The spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (AP) patients, averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. The bacteriological results could not distinguish between ADA Type III and IV periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any AP patient. The patients designated as early onset periodontitis (EOP) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of Bacteroides gingivalis and/or B. intermedius. Two types of EOP were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. Four localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients were notable in not having detectable A. actinomycetemcomitans. The data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of LJP are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent B. gingivalis and B. intermedius.
TI  - Isolation of Actinomyces bacteriophage from human dental plaque.
AB  - Human dental plaque samples were screened for the presence of bacteriophage for Actinomyces viscosus and Streptococcus sanguis. None of the 336 samples yielded phage for S. sanguis, but 10 contained virulent actinomyces phage. A high host cell specificity was observed in that one phage isolate infected only A. viscosus T14V, eight phage isolates infected only A. viscosus MG-1, and one infected both strains. None was capable of productively infecting various other actinomyces strains that represented the six actinomyces coaggregation groups. Because phage-containing samples occurred randomly in this survey, no correlation between the individual collecting the samples, dental clinic, or type of patient and the presence of phage in the sample was noted. Examination of one of the samples that yielded phage for the presence of a natural host strain for that particular phage resulted in the isolation of two strains which were identified as A. viscosus serotype II and Actinomyces naeslundii serotype I. This is the first report of an A. naeslundii host strain and actinomyces bacteriophage of human dental plaque origin. The finding of both phage and host strains in the same dental plaque sample along with the observation of high host cell specificity by these phage provide indicators that support an active role for actinomyces bacteriophage in oral microbial ecology. The use of these freshly isolated phage as probes to study actinomyces coaggregation properties is discussed.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - pH change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (G-Tase)-together with either Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, or Lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. The pH in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. In the absence of GTase, the bacteria other than S. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. The pH of the plaque formed with GTase alone did not show the pH decrease seen when the plaque contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.
TI  - Surface properties of Streptococcus sanguis FW213 mutants nonadherent to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Seventeen mutants of Streptococcus sanguis FW213 nonadherent to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite were isolated after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate, nitrosoguanidine, nitrous acid, hydroxylamine, or 2-aminopurine. Enrichment for nonadherent mutants was accomplished by successive adsorptions of the adherent strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. After enrichment, variant colonial morphology on tryptic agar was used as a screening technique for selection of nonadherent mutants, with loss of colonial opacity frequently associated with loss of adherence ability. These mutants were further characterized for additional surface properties, including twitching motility, saliva-induced aggregation, coaggregation with Actinomyces species, surface hydrophobicity, and presence of fimbriae. Results from these assays indicated that the nonadherent mutants fell into six phenotypic groups. A correlation between the loss of adherence ability, a decrease in cell fimbriation, and a decrease in surface hydrophobicity is apparent.
TI  - Lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - A cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) from Streptococcus mutans OMZ175 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, DEAE-Sephacel and Blue-Sepharose CL.6B chromatography, and Sephacryl S200 gel permeation. The catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between pH 5 and 6.2. The concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was around 0.02 mM and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. The enzyme seemed to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. Increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mM enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. The enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to NADH, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a Hill coefficient of about 1.9. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on Sephacryl S200. Monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. Antibodies obtained against the purified S. mutans OMZ175 LDH cross-reacted with the sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of LDHs from different S. mutans serotypes, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646, and Actinomyces viscosus NY 1. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of L-LDHs from S. mutans serotypes and S. sanguis. Cross-reactions were also observed with the LDHs from A. viscosus and L. casei, the latter being the least related. A very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the L-LDH from S. mutans OMZ175 and the D-LDH from Lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be detected with mammal LDHs.
TI  - Surface structures (peritrichous fibrils and tufts of fibrils) found on Streptococcus sanguis strains may be related to their ability to coaggregate with other oral genera.
AB  - We screened 36 strains of Streptococcus sanguis biotype I and 8 strains of S. sanguis biotype II for the presence of surface structures and for their ability to coaggregate with Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Negative staining under an electron microscope revealed detectable surface structures on all S. sanguis strains. The majority of strains (38 of 44) carried peritrichous fibrils, which have an irregular profile and no distinct width. They usually appeared as a fringe with a constant width around the cell. Strains selected for measurement had a fringe with an average length of 72.4 +/- 8.5 nm on biotype I strains and 51.6 +/- 3.3 nm on biotype II strains. Some fibrillar biotype I strains carried an additional, longer (158.7 +/- 33.1 nm) type of fibril projecting through the shorter fibrils. Fibrillar density was characteristic for each strain, ranging from very dense on all cells in a population to very sparse on a few cells in a population. A small group of six strains carried tufts of fibrils in a lateral or polar position on the cell. Either one or two lengths of fibril were present in the tuft depending on the strain. One strain carried both peritrichous fibrils and fimbriae. Fimbriae are flexible structures with a constant width (4.5 to 5.0 nm) all along their length but very variable lengths (less than or equal to 0.7 micron) on each cell. S. sanguis I and II both included strains with peritrichous fibrils and tufts of fibrils, but the mixed morphotype strain was confined to biotype II. Fibrils were present on cells at all stages throughout the growth cycle for the strains tested. Freshly isolated fibrillar strains coaggregated consistently well with A. viscosus and A. naeslundii, although some fibrillar reference strains lacked the ability. In addition, all tufted strains could not coaggregate, but the strains with the mixed morphotype coaggregated well. Coaggregation with F. nucleatum was very strong for the fibrillar strains, but less strong for the tufted strains. We discuss the possible correlation between S. sanguis surface structure and ability to coaggregate.
TI  - Characterization of protein and mannan polysaccharide antigens of yeasts, moulds, and actinomycetes.
AB  - Antigens in coccidioidin were compared with purified subfractions via tandem immunoelectrophoresis (IEP) and by a combination of advancing line and crossed IEP. Rocket IEP was suitable for titrating the reactions and showing the relationship between column fractions. These techniques required multicomponent antisera produced by hyperimmunization over many months and by the use of known standard migration pairs. The IEP variations were used to chart the development of antisera against coccidioidin factors, to monitor antigen purifications, and to test the immunochemical homogeneity of an isolated antigen. Mannose-based heteroglycans of Cryptococcus neoformans were recovered from the culture filtrate. After precipitation of the major viscous glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) with ethanol or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, the supernate is reserved because it contains a galactoxylomannan (GalXM). After removal of glucuronic acid from the GXM, the resulting xylomannan of serotype A was amenable to 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry; it revealed nonreducing xylose, alpha-1,3-mannose, and alpha-1,2/1,3 disubstituted mannose, thus confirming by an independent means what was previously known. The characterization sequence of GalXM included: (1) gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of neutral sugars as peracetylated aldononitriles; (2) methylation-fragmentation GLC mass spectrometry to determine the glycosidic linkages; and (3) 13C-NMR showing similarities to mannan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Affinity chromatography of the GalXM on concanavalin A separated the galactoxylo component from an adsorbed mannoprotein. Selection of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) relies on presumptive enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) or radioimmunoassays for rapid screening of clones and for determination of isotypes; however, higher resolution confirmatory tests are needed to obtain MAbs of desired specificity. MAbs against Candida tropicalis mannan were labeled with horseradish peroxidase to use for detecting mannan in serum. MAbs against the partially purified "m" factor of histoplasmin were characterized by the enzyme-linked immunoelectro-transfer blot technique (EITB), revealing unsuspected complexity in the antigen. Secreted proteins of Nocardia asteroides were isoelectrically focused; three proteins, identified by EITB as promising to be specific for that actinomycete, were cut out of gels and used to immunize mice for production of MAbs. The fimbriae of Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii that mediate lactose-reversible coagglutination with Streptococcus sanguis have been used to evoke MAbs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - The association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  - Sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. Culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. Over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. Analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured higher levels of Neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high Streptococcus sanguis levels and total Gram-positive cocci and fewer Gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella sp. Sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and Streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; Actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; Strep. mutans, Veillonella sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and Strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. Sucrose intake was negatively related to concentrations of Neisseria sp. on the tongue and total Gram-positive bacilli in saliva. A definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. The high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
TI  - Inhibition of [3H]-thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts by extracts from human dental plaque, oral bacteria of the Streptococcus and Actinomyces species.

The results show that a variety of oral bacteria, not usually considered to be periodontal pathogens, elaborate factors that adversely affect fibroblasts.

TI  - Longitudinal investigation of bacteriology of human fissure decay: epidemiological studies in molars shortly after eruption.
AB  - In the present investigation, the proportions of Streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli, Streptococcus sanguis, veillonellae, and an unidentified actinomyces-like organism in dental plaque on occlusal fissures of first mandibular molars were monitored at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period in 368 children who were initially in grades 1 or 2. Teeth destined to become decayed exhibited a significant increase in the proportions of S. mutans from 6 to 24 months before the diagnosis of dental decay. Lactobacilli were sporadically detected but when present were associated with dental decay. Children whose teeth exhibited the greatest number of decayed surfaces had, at all time periods, significantly higher proportions of S. mutans than did children who were caries free. Many teeth had high proportions of S. mutans at their entry into the study. About 10% of the monitored teeth erupted during the period of observation, and in these teeth both S. mutans and lactobacilli could be significantly associated with decay. In these newly erupted teeth S. mutans outnumbered lactobacilli by ca. 20 to 1. S. sanguis, veillonellae, and the unidentified actinomyces-like organism could not be associated with the development of decay. These findings strongly implicate S. mutans and possibly lactobacilli as dental pathogens and suggest that if decay is to be controlled by strategies based upon a S. mutans infection, then the various tactics used probably will have to be performed on primary teeth, as these teeth are the most likely sources of infection for the permanent teeth.
TI  - Human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  - In clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. This study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. Dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (BE) in buffer and pooled human serum (PHS) from pure cultures of Streptococcus sanguis. Actinomyces viscosus, A naeslundii, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium sp and Veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. In addition, fractions of S sanguis culture fluids (CFs) from Sephadex G-10 chromatography were evaluated. All BE solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C and heat-inactivated prior to testing. All BEs in buffer attracted neutrophils, with the greatest responses seen to S sanguis and B intermedius followed by A viscosus. Migration to all BEs in PHS was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all BEs are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. A viscosus BE activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. CFs of S sanguis, A viscosus, and to a lesser degree, Fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. Evidence from [3H]FMLP competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that S sanguis CFs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. Of the bacteria associated with health, S sanguis and A viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. This observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased neutrophil transmigration in early disease.
TI  - Immunologic profile of juvenile periodontitis. I. Lymphocyte blastogenesis and the autologous mixed lymphocyte response.
AB  - Studies of blastogenesis of lymphocytes in culture from juvenile periodontitis (JP) patients have been inconclusive. Experiments demonstrating differences in lymphocyte blastogenesis to preparations of putative periodontopathogens in JP and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were performed. Variables in the blastogenesis assay system recently reported were controlled which included using a range of cell and activator concentrations, incubation times of 3, 5 and 7 days, conical-bottomed microtest wells and chemical inhibitors during labeling of DNA which permits accurate assessment of lymphocyte blastogenesis. Using these modified culture conditions, stimulated lymphocytes of localized (LJP) and generalized (GJP) forms of JP patients did not differ significantly from stimulated lymphocytes of healthy subjects in counts incorporated, stimulation index, incubation time, cell concentration or activator dose required for maximal blastogenesis to bacterial preparations of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Y-4), Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochraceus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis and Treponema denticola. Unstimulated lymphocyte cultures reflecting the autologous mixed lymphocyte response (AMLR) were increased for LJP compared to healthy subjects although not statistically significant. Unstimulated lymphocyte cultures of GJP were decreased compared to healthy subjects and LJP (P less than 0.05). These observations indicate that GJP patients may have abnormalities in T- and B-lymphocyte regulatory mechanisms.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of dental plaque on bovine enamel implants worn intra-orally in children.
AB  - Nine caries-active children, each from six to nine years old, wore small removable enamel implants intra-orally for four weeks as part of an effort to develop removable model systems for studying dental plaque in fissures. The implants, consisting of two enamel cubes arranged to simulate a fissural space, were cemented in box preparations in stainless steel crowns on pulpotomized primary molars. Upon removal, the fissural spaces were opened to facilitate plaque harvesting. The plaque samples were cultured, and enamel decalcification of the plaque-exposed surfaces was measured. Quantitative microbial values were compared with those of natural fissure plaque samples from both caries-active (CA) and caries-and restoration-free (CF) children, also from six to nine years old. Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis levels of fissural insert plaque (FI) and natural fissural plaque from (CA) were similar. Both contained higher S. mutans levels than did plaque from (CF). FI harbored higher concentrations of Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species and lower concentrations of Neisseria species. Otherwise, FI plaque resembled natural fissure plaque. Microhardness of FI plaque-exposed enamel decreased significantly compared with pre-experimental values and showed a significant negative correlation with values for total lactobacilli on selective media, and for S. mutans on non-selective media.
TI  - A possible mechanism for the cellular coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus  ATCC 19246 and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10557.
AB  - The cells of Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 (Av19246) and Streptococcus sanguis  ATCC 10557 (Ss10557) coaggregated immediately after mixing in 40 mM-Tris/HCl buffer. Optimal conditions were pH 7.5 in the presence of Ca2+ at 0.1 mM or higher. Na2 EDTA and its analogues, Na2MgEDTA and Na2MnEDTA at 7.5 mM inhibited the coaggregation. Trypsin and heat treatment impaired the reactive site on Av19246 cells, but not on Ss10557 cells. The coaggregates, once formed, dissociated gradually during extended incubation at 37 degrees C; this was prevented by addition of sufficient Ca2+. The disaggregation appears to be a spontaneous denaturation of the proteinaceous reactive site on Av19246 cell surface. Thus, the coaggregation involves the interaction of a lectin-like substance on the surface of Av19246 with a carbohydrate site on Ss10557. Native Ss10557 cell walls possessed reactivity with Av19246 cells but 5% (w/v) TCA-extracted cell wall residues did not. A carbohydrate moiety extracted from Ss10557 exhibited a high potency in blocking coaggregation, and coaggregates were dissociated upon addition of the carbohydrate. Lactose, galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (the latter two are major constituents of the antigen extract) also significantly inhibited the coaggregation, but the other antigen components, glucose and rhamnose, did not. Relative inhibitory activity, expressed as molar potency, of carbohydrate antigen, lactose, galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine respectively, was approximately 26 X 10(3):16:4:1. Ss10557 cells and cell walls reacted only with a Ricinus communis (castor bean) agglutinin-120 but not with Glycine max (soybean) agglutinin, Arachis hypogaea (peanut) agglutinin or Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (phytohaemagglutinin).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Carbohydrate composition of dental plaque from primates with irradiation caries.
AB  - Carbohydrate analyses were performed on dental plaque collected from the teeth of irradiated monkeys, non-irradiated monkeys and a group of Streptococcus mutans free animals, all of which were fed the same standard cariogenic diet. Glucose was the predominant sugar constituent in plaque and was detected in highest concentration in the irradiated animals. Small amounts of pentoses and other hexoses were also present. Plaque from irradiated animals contained, by comparison with the other groups, higher levels of Strep. mutans and lower levels of Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces.
TI  - Growth of oral Streptococcus species and Actinomyces viscosus in human saliva.
AB  - Microorganisms in dental plaque live in constant association with saliva. The role of saliva in the adherence of bacteria to the teeth and the antibacterial properties of saliva have been well investigated; less interest has been shown in the possible role of saliva as a substrate for oral microorganisms. In this study it was shown that saliva can serve as a growth medium for oral Streptococcus spp. and Actinomyces viscosus. The cell production of these organisms on saliva was carbohydrate limited. The doubling times for growth on glucose-supplemented saliva (4 to 5 mmol/liter) ranged from 1.6 to 4.0 h. The availability of carbohydrate sources for the oral microflora is discussed in relation to microbial growth in the oral cavity.
TI  - Effect of saliva on coaggregation of oral Actinomyces and Streptococcus species.
AB  - Human oral actinomyces and streptococci that exhibit specific coaggregation patterns when the cells are suspended in buffer were tested for their ability to coaggregate in saliva. Of 53 paired combinations of actinomyces (Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, or Actinomyces sp. WVa 963) and streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis or S. morbillorum) that exhibited coaggregation in buffer, all but 4 pairs also coaggregated when suspended in saliva. Twenty-four pairs exhibited lactose-inhibited coaggregation in buffer: 19 of these were identical in saliva. The other five pairs either did not coaggregate or formed coaggregates that were not inhibited by lactose. Highly specific coaggregations known to occur with buffer-suspended cells (e.g., a streptococcal strain that coaggregates with a single strain of actinomyces) were unchanged when cells were suspended in saliva. These results indicate that the coaggregation properties of both oral actinomyces and streptococci are very similar with cells suspended in either saliva or coaggregation buffer. Thus, the potential for coaggregation among bacteria in the oral cavity is evident. The possible mechanisms which mediate coaggregation in saliva are discussed.

TI  - Sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  - 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. The type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. The enzyme activities were determined as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Although variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains, the same general pattern was noticed. Strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii. Most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like S. sanguis and S. mitior. In some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. The level of sucrase activity in S. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype V/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes I and IV corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype III/serotype a always showed low activity. In most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. In all species, exept S. sanguis and S. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. On the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  - Colonization of the subgingival area by Bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  - The initial event in colonization of the subgingival area by B. gingivalis is its attachment to host cells and Gram-positive bacteria in pre-formed plaque. The level of B. gingivalis is partly governed by products of other plaque bacteria, especially by sanguicin. Once B. gingivalis resides in its nidus and starts to proliferate, expulsion of pre-existing residents may occur, especially of attached Gram-positive bacteria, through the inhibitory action of the B. gingivalis product, hematin. The bacteriocin produced by black-pigmented Bacteroides also seems to play an important role in their establishment. Melaninogenicus possessed strong inhibitory activity against Actinomyces species. This was not completely confirmed with fresh isolates of B. gingivalis from advanced periodontitis patients. Various factors other than inhibitory substances produced by B. gingivalis and related bacteria can also affect the colonization of this species. Since the crevice area is influenced by gingival fluid, the nature of specific antibody and the other affecting components should be considered collectively with the interaction between new predominant colonizers and other pre-existing residents.
TI  - A conceptual model for the co-existence of Streptococcus spp. and Actinomyces spp. in dental plaque.
AB  - One of the most important questions in ecology is how to explain the co-existence of the variety of physiologically related organisms in the same habitat. A model is presented for the co-existence of Streptococcus species and Actinomyces species in dental plaque. The hypothesis is that these organisms co-exist because they simultaneously utilize several carbon and energy substrates. The hypothesis follows from the observation that the growth yield of oral streptococci and actinomyces in saliva is limited by carbohydrate. Preliminary experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis using mixed chemostat cultures and gnotobiotic rats. Competition between S. mutans K1R and A. viscosus Ut2 in mixed chemostat cultures on glucose and asparagine was hampered by the early appearance of high-glucose-affinity variants of A. viscosus. From the physiological characteristics of S. sanguis and S. milleri, it might be predicted that simultaneous utilization of carbohydrate and arginine would enable these organisms to co-exist with S. mutans in an ecosystem. To test this mechanism under natural conditions, germ-free rats were inoculated with a combination of S. mutans K1R and S. sanguis P4A7 or the combination S. mutans K1R and S. milleri B448. The rats were fed on three different diets: (1) 58% cornstarch; (2) 48% cornstarch and 10% sucrose; and (3) 53% cornstarch and 5% arginine. The results of this experiment demonstrated that dietary arginine caused a significant decrease of the ratios K1R/P4A7 and K1R/B448 in dental plaque.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - The function and distribution of different fimbriae on strains of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii differ in their abilities to colonize tooth and epithelial surfaces. These differences appear to be associated with the distribution of different fimbriae on the two species and with the distinct adherence-related functions of these structures.
TI  - A simple method for extracting human lymphocyte stimulants from human dental plaque bacteria of the genus Actinomyces.
AB  - The effect of acid concentration on the hot-acid extraction of antigens from Actinomyces viscosus that stimulate human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro was tested. The optimum pH for release of these antigens in a soluble low molecular-weight form was pH 2.3. Preliminary purification on Sepharose 4B demonstrated that most of the lympho-stimulatory material (about 90 per cent) had a mol. wt of about 100,000. This partially-purified antigenic material was mainly protein. The pH 2.3 hot-acid extraction was also suitable for extracting antigens that stimulate cellular immune responses from three strains of Actinomyces naeslundii and 1 strain of Actinomyces israelii, but did not release lympho-stimulatory material from Streptococcus sanguis which is a poor human peripheral-blood lymphocyte-stimulant and was used to demonstrate that the hot-acid extraction is not simply extracting a mitogenic macromolecule common to all bacteria. As good yields of soluble, biologically-active antigens were obtained from all of the Actinomyces, the procedure described will facilitate the purification and characterization of these antigens.
TI  - Growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial pH levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at pH 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis showed greater acid tolerance than strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces viscosus. For all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. These data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

Immunodiffusion tests and ELISA revealed that the antibody reacted with purified PGP from group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain Sv as well as crude phenol-water and saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria except for a few species such as biotype B S. sanguis, Micrococcus sp., and Actinomyces viscosus. Whole cells of serotype b S. mutans and Staphylococcus epidermidis were agglutinated upon addition of 3G6 mAb, while those of most other species were not significantly affected by this procedure. A hapten inhibition study showed that glycerophosphate was only a potent inhibitor of passive hemagglutination reactions between LTA coated sheep erythrocytes and 3G6 mAb.

TI  - Comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  - Oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. Strains of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. Strains of B. intermedius, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and B. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. An overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. This suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. Pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of S. sanguis and A. viscosus and increased numbers of S. mutans. Analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the S. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. Absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl Sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. These observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. The data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.
TI  - Nonspecific induction of immunoglobulin M antibodies to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms after polyclonal human B-lymphocyte activation by Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The production of antibodies to oral bacteria was determined in lymphocyte cultures stimulated with sonicated Fusobacterium nucleatum, a potent inducer of polyclonal B-cell activation. After 9 days the cultures were examined by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to F. nucleatum, Bacteroides gingivalis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis. Antibodies to these four bacteria were detected in cultures stimulated with polyclonal B-cell activation-inducing concentrations of F. nucleatum. However, significant concentrations of antibodies to F. nucleatum, but not to the other three microorganisms, were produced in cultures that received suboptimal polyclonal B-cell activation-inducing doses of F. nucleatum. Absorption studies indicated the specificity of the antibodies to each of the bacteria tested. IgM antibody production induced by F. nucleatum was enhanced by the addition of T cells. The production of IgM antibodies to the bacteria was reproducible in cultures from a single person tested on 3 consecutive days. The concentration of antibodies in replicate cultures, however, fluctuated greatly. To obtain consistent responses on successive days, multiple replicate cultures were required. These results suggest that F. nucleatum, which is frequently present in subgingival plaque, could induce the production of antibodies not only to F. nucleatum, but also to other microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases.

When S. sanguis 34 was disrupted by homogenization with glass beads and fractionated by differential centrifugation, only the cell wall fraction agglutinated A. viscosus T14V. When strain 34 was treated with lysozyme, the coaggregating capability of the cells was essentially unaltered. Sacculi prepared from lysozyme-treated strain 34 and additionally purified by electrophoresis were agglutinated by strain T14V.

AB  - The growth in Brain Heart Infusion medium containing glucose or sucrose of Streptococcus mutans strain OMZ 176, two strains of Strep. sanguis (ATCC 10556 and No. 39) and Actinomyces viscosus type ATCC 27044 was inhibited by xylitol but not by D-arabitol or ribitol. When fructose was substituted for glucose, xylitol had no growth-inhibiting effect. It was also shown that the bacteria produced less acid in the presence of xylitol, as measured by the pH of the cultures or by neutralization with alkali.
TI  - New Actinomyces and Streptococcus coaggregation groups among human oral isolates  from the same site.
AB  - The coaggregation properties of recent human oral streptococcal and actinomyces isolates from the same site were determined and compared with the coaggregation properties of well-characterized stock strains of these two kinds of bacteria. Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and phenotypically similar strains of actinomyces were isolated from subgingival samples from periodontally healthy older individuals, from persons participating in an experimental gingivitis study, and from young persons with localized (juvenile) and generalized (severe) periodontitis. All 34 of the actinomyces isolates coaggregated with reagent strains of S. sanguis that represented the four streptococcal coaggregation groups. Most of these actinomyces exhibited coaggregations identical to those of actinomyces stock strains. However, five isolates of an Actinomyces WVa-963 serovar exhibited a coaggregation pattern different from any previously described, which was used to define coaggregation group F. All coaggregations with members of this group were lactose inhibitable. Only 57% (8 of 14) of the recent S. sanguis isolates coaggregated with actinomyces reagent strains. But when the nonreactive streptococcal isolates were tested for their ability to coaggregate with actinomyces from the same patient, a new, highly specific coaggregation pattern (group 6) for S. sanguis was discovered. Coaggregation of these streptococci was observed only with certain isolates of A. naeslundii (members of coaggregation group D) from the same site, and none of these coaggregations were inhibited by lactose. Subsequent testing revealed that streptococci of group 6 coaggregated with group D actinomyces from other sources but not with actinomyces of other coaggregation groups. Only two strains of S. sanguis failed to coaggregate with any strain of actinomyces tested. These results indicate that nearly all fresh isolates of these species obtained from both diseased and healthy sites exhibit specific, nonrandom patterns of coaggregation and suggest the widespread occurrence of in vivo cell-to-cell recognition between oral actinomyces and streptococci.
TI  - Prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  - Fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. In a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii were determined. Of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or Veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. The remaining 80 isolates were identified as Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus MG-intermedius, or Streptococcus morbillorum. Of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. Compared with previously characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. The other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. Thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. It is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.
TI  - Copper-inhibition of the growth of oral streptococci and actinomyces.
AB  - Copper ions were found to inhibit the rate of growth in broth culture of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarious, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. In all cases, 10(-3) M copper inhibited the rate of growth, whereas 10(-4) M and lower concentrations had little or no effect. At the concentrations used in mouthwashes one mode of action of copper ions is to reduce the rate of growth of oral bacteria in vitro.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and nonstreptococcal oral bacteria: characterization of wall-associated protein and comparison with extracellular protein antigen.
AB  - A soluble wall-associated common protein (WAP) has been isolated from cell wall-extracted antigens of exponentially growing cells of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, two serotypes (a and e), of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus OMZ104. The WAP antigens from the different strains were obtained by chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column of sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated immunoprecipitates. The affinity-isolated WAP antigens from the different oral bacteria were identical, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (showing an apparent molecular weight of 80,000) and amino acid and sugar compositions. This WAP antigen, common to all bacterial strains tested, consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar. A comparison of the chemical properties of this WAP antigen and of the soluble extracellular common protein antigen showed that, although having similar amino acid and sugar compositions, the two proteins are different. Electron micrographs developed after immunocytological labeling of the WAP antigen on whole cells confirmed that it is located on the cell wall.
TI  - A factor from Actinomyces viscosus T14V that specifically aggregates Streptococcus sanguis H1.
AB  - A highly specific aggregation factor for Streptococcus sanguis H1 (AFH1) was obtained by lysozyme treatment of Actinomyces viscosus T14V. At 1 micrograms/ml, AFH1 aggregated a suspension of S. sanguis H1, with which A. viscosus T14V coaggregates by a mechanism not inhibited by lactose: even at much higher levels AFH1 caused little or no aggregation of streptococci from other coaggregation groups (J. O. Cisar et al., Infect. Immun. 24:742-752, 1979). The most active fraction of AFH1 obtained by gel chromatography (near the void volume of Bio-Gel A1.5 m) reacted as a single antigen with anti-A. viscosus T14V serum and was unrelated to the fimbrial antigens of A. viscosus T14V. Smaller molecular fractions, at high levels, inhibited aggregation of S. sanguis H1 by high-molecular-weight AFH1 as well as coaggregation of S. sanguis H1 with A. viscosus T14V. The AFH1 fraction with high aggregating activity was composed of approximately 53% cell wall components (alanine, glutamine, lysine, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylmuramic acid). 40% polysaccharide (N-acetylgalactosamine, rhamnose, and 6-deoxytalose), and 7% protein; teichoic acid was not detected. The fraction which inhibited aggregation and coaggregation contained much less of the cell wall constituents and more of the polysaccharide than the fraction with potent aggregating activity. Aggregation was completely prevented either by treating AFH1 with 0.01 M periodate at 25 degrees C for 4 h or by treating S. sanguis H1 with heat or pronase. A role for electrostatic forces in the aggregation was indicated by: (i) NaCl inhibition of aggregation, and (ii) a great decrease in aggregation potency as a result of chemical modification of either cationic or anionic groups of AFH1. On the other hand, NaCl reversed the aggregation only very weakly. The overall data suggest that a carbohydrate-protein interaction may be dominant in the aggregation of S. sanguis H1 by AFH1 and in the coaggregation of S. sanguis H1 with A. viscosus T14V.
TI  - Coaggregation of human oral Cytophaga species and Actinomyces israelii.
AB  - A total of 19 strains of oral Cytophaga sp. obtained from subgingival plaque deposits were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, and S. mitis. Coaggregation was observed only with A. israelii. Based on their coaggregation patterns with eight A. israelii strains, the Cytophaga strains were distributed among three distinct groups: those that coaggregated with A. israelii PK16 but not with A. israelii W1011 (ATCC 29322), those that coaggregated with A. israelii ATCC 29322 but not with A. israelii PK16, and those that coaggregated with none of the eight A. israelii strains. In each of the coaggregations, prior heat treatment (85 degrees C, 30 min) of the Cytophaga cells prevented coaggregation, whereas identical treatment of the A. israelii cells had no effect. The ability of A. israelii PK16 to form adherent plaque on a tooth surface previously coated with Cytophaga plaque was tested with one of the coaggregating Cytophaga strains. White patches of A. israelii plaque were found covering both the amber-colored Cytophaga plaque on the cementum surface as well as the enamel surface to which Cytophaga strains do not adhere. Electron micrographs of thin-sectioned mixed-plaque material revealed both cell types in close proximity. In addition, electron micrographs of negatively stained coaggregated cells showed interbacterial adherence between surface fimbrae on A. israelii and outer membrane blebs on the gram-negative Cytophaga sp. The kinetics of binding of A. israelii to spheroidal hydroxyapatite and to root powder were indicative of a high-affinity binding system with comparatively large numbers of available binding sites on both substrata. These results indicate the highly specific nature of Cytophaga sp.--A. israelii recognition. The contribution of such recognition toward the mechanisms that are responsible for the indigenous nature of these oral bacteria is discussed.
TI  - In vitro antiplaque activity of octenidine dihydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) against  preformed plaques of selected oral plaque-forming microorganisms.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of octenidine dihydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) against intact preformed in vitro plaques of four indigenous oral plaque-forming microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii, was studied. Both absolute (plaque bactericidal index) and relative (chlorhexidine coefficient) indices of antiplaque efficacy were established. Octenidine dihydrochloride compared favorably with chlorhexidine digluconate with respect to overall antiplaque potency in this in vitro plaque bactericidal model. These data indicate that prudent selection of treatment concentration and duration and frequency of exposure should provide an effective means to aid in controlling dental caries and Actinomyces-associated disease in vivo.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Of human dental plaque bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus accelerates immunoglobulin  A protease secretion in Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  
TI  - Degradation of the microbial and salivary components participating in human dental plaque formation by proteases elaborated by plaque bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of facultative, Gram-positive, sporulating bacilli which produce caseinolytic enzymes were isolated from human early dental plaque. A major component of the extracellular caseinolytic enzymes elaborated by strong producers seemed to be neutral zinc proteases. The extracellular proteases inactivated glucosyltransferase of Streptococcus mutans and inhibited the synthesis of adherent glucans from sucrose. The enzymes also degraded the Strep. mutans cell-surface receptor for dextran and glucan, the receptor for salivary agglutinins, located on Streptococcus sanguis cells, and the surface component of Actinomyces viscosus cells involved in co-agglutination with Strep. sanguis cells. The enzymes hydrolysed human whole saliva proteins, which seemed to result in loss of the ability to agglutinate Strep. sanguis cells.
TI  - Regulatory effect of monocytes on T cell proliferative responses to oral microbial antigens.
AB  - Mononuclear cell preparations isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation from human peripheral blood were found to vary considerably in the number of monocytes they contained (mean, 20.3%; range, 13 to 33%). The regulatory role of monocytes in T cell proliferative responses to sonic extracts of a panel of oral microorganisms was therefore investigated. T cells were fractionated by anti-immunoglobulin chromatography and depleted of monocytes by treatment with a monoclonal anti-human Ia-like (DR locus antigen) antibody and complement. Purified populations of monocytes were obtained by extensive adherence procedures. The resultant cell populations were greater than 95% pure, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Monocyte-depleted T cells failed to respond by proliferation to the nonoral antigen tetanus toxoid, as well as to any oral microorganism, but retained responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin. Readdition of monocytes in final concentrations of from 5 to 15% resulted in the restoration of maximal T cell proliferation. Monocytes in greater numbers suppressed T cell responses to all sonic extracts tested.
TI  - Characterization of a galactose-specific lectin from Actinomyces viscosus by a model aggregation system.
AB  - A simple model system has been developed in which lectin-mediated aggregation of  glycoprotein-coated beads can be monitored by following the decrease in light scattering at 650 nm. Aggregation has been characterized with the lectin of Actinomyces viscosus T14V. Its dependence on pH, temperature, and stirring rate was examined, and the number of bacterial cells in relation to the number of latex beads resulting in optimal aggregation was established. This system has the advantage of permitting the study of a single ligand of defined structure. The ligand density was determined with radiolabeled glycoproteins. Under the conditions of the assay, ligand leakage was less than 3%, and ligands were not displaced from the beads by various proteins, glycoproteins, or by other components present in the assay mixture. Latex beads coated with asialofetuin aggregate upon the addition of A. viscosus T14V cells. By contrast, when asialofetuin was first extensively treated with purified galactose oxidase, no aggregation occurred. Only after reduction with NaBH(4) was aggregation restored, demonstrating that galactose termini of asialofetuin are essential for the binding of A. viscosus lectin. An absolute requirement for calcium was also demonstrated. Various sugars inhibited aggregation in the following order, starting with the most effective: lactose, methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, methyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside. Beads coated with fimbriae from A. viscosus coaggregated with neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes and with Streptococcus sanguis cells. In each instance the aggregation was inhibited by lactose, indicating that the A. viscosus lectin is located in the fimbriae. Cells grown under different conditions differed in their effectiveness in aggregating glycoprotein-coated beads, suggesting differences in lectin density or accessibility. Two different experimental designs were used to establish the minimum ligand density for aggregation to occur. In one type of experiment, a threshold concentration was found for asialo alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, but not for asialofetuin. With an alternate approach in which a different population of galactose residues was exposed, a threshold phenomenon was also demonstrated for asialofetuin. The importance of structural ligand features in the aggregation assay is discussed in view of these findings.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of coaggregation-defective mutants of Actinomyces  viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Spontaneously occurring coaggregation-defective (COG-) mutants of oral actinomycetes and streptococci were isolated and used to study interactions between cells of these two kinds of bacteria. COG- mutants of each kind of bacteria were isolated by a simple enrichment scheme. Parent strains were mixed with a coaggregating partner strain, coaggregated cells were removed by low-speed centrifugation, and non-coaggregated cells were recycled by the addition of more partner strain cells. COG- mutants constituted up to 10% of the parent strain cell type in the final enriched cell suspension. Unlike their respective parent strains, COG- mutants of Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104, and A. naeslundii I exhibited no lactose-reversible coaggregation with certain oral Streptococcus sanguis strains. However, these COG- mutants were not altered in their coaggregations with another S. sanguis strain, H1, a member of a streptococcal coaggregation group that exhibits only lactose-nonreversible coaggregations with oral actinomycetes. Although all coaggregations between S. sanguis H1 and these actinomycetes appear to be alike, examination of a COG- mutant of S. sanguis H1 revealed that, like its parent, it coaggregated with A. viscosus T14V and its COG- mutants, but unlike its parent, it did not coaggregate with the two A. naeslundii strains or their COG- mutants. Thus, it was concluded that at least two types of surface components are important in mediating coaggregation between S. sanguis H1 and actinomycetes. The COG- mutant of S. sanguis allowed detection of these components, which were indistinguishable in previous studies.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: isolation and biochemical characterization of the extracellular protein antigen.
AB  - An extracellular soluble common protein (ECP) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, of a representative strain of each of Bratthall's seven serological groups of Streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of Lactobacillus salivarius and Actinomyces viscosus. The ECP antigens from the different strains were prepared from SDS-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. The identity of such purified ECP antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in SDS-PAGE, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. This common antigen (ECP) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  - BACTERIAL-NEUTROPHIL INTERACTIONS may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. This study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. Included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of Capnocytophaga, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. Chemotaxis was measured using Boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using Staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. None of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. Capnocytophaga species., Bacteroides species., A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. Activity was lost after dialysis. Extracts of Bacteroides species, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. The exception was Capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. Such chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
TI  - Humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  - Serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. With the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibody titers to isolates of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleation were determined. Antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes to B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, F. nucleatum, and S. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. No correlations were found with serum IgM titers. These findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of human dental fissure plaque.
AB  - Plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. Twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. Streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, Streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and S. sanguis constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). A few isolates of "S. mitior" and "S. milleri" were found, but no S. salivarius. Staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). Gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). Of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. Arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). Gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). Only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. Although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of S. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. The large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.
TI  - Antibodies against the Ag2 fimbriae of Actinomyces viscosus T14V inhibit lactose-sensitive bacterial adherence.
AB  - Monospecific antisera against the Ag1 and Ag2 fimbrial components of Actinomyces  viscosus T14V were produced by immunizing rabbits with immune precipitates of each antigen harvested from crossed-immunoelectrophoresis plates. The Fab fragments prepared from these sera were used as specific reagents in immunoelectron microscopy to identify each fimbrial component on the bacterial surface and also were assayed for their abilities to prevent the coaggregation of A. viscosus T14V with Streptococcus sanguis 34, an interaction that is lactose sensitive. Each Fab preparation appeared to react with different fibrillar structures present on the actinomycete, and only the Ag2-specific Fabs blocked coaggregation. These results provide strong support for the presence of distinct types of fimbriae on A. viscosus T14V and indicate the exclusive involvement of Ag2 fimbriae in lactose-sensitive adherence.
TI  - Inhibitors of coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Streptococcus sanguis 34: beta-galactosides, related sugars, and anionic amphipathic compounds.
AB  - Coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus T14V (T14V) and Streptococcus sanguis  34 (Ss34) depends upon specific reaction between lectin on T14V and carbohydrate on Ss34. Studies on coaggregation inhibition by sugars related to D-galactose, beta-galactosides, and amphipathic molecules revealed: (i) D-fucose, D-talose approximately equal to D-galactose, which was 0.2 potency of lactose. No other hexoses or pentoses inhibited at 0.1 M. (ii) Gal beta (1 leads to 3)GalNAc alpha OCH2C6H5 was the most potent beta-galactoside inhibitor; it had 20 times the potency of lactose. (iii) Anionic nonaromatic amphipathic compounds were good inhibitors; sodium deoxycholate (I) was equal to lactose; sodium dodecyl sulfate (II) had 15 times the potency of lactose; there was 90 to 100% irreversible inhibition when T14V was treated with 0.005 M (II). Treatment of Ss34 with II had no effect. (iv) Synergism of inhibition was observed between lactose and I or lactose and II, e.g., inhibition by 0.01 M lactose = 5%; inhibition by 0.01 M I = 9%; inhibition by 0.01 M lactose + 0.01 M I = 87%. (v) The irreversible inhibition by II was prevented when 0.25 M lactose or 0.25 M I was present during treatment of T14V with 0.005 M II. (vi) Synergism and prevention by lactose or by I of irreversible inhibition by II suggest that all three react at the same site on T14V lectin. We hypothesize that the T14V lectin combining site for Ss34 carbohydrate has specific affinity for beta-galactosides and for anionic nonaromatic amphipathic molecules. This site can be saturated by either kind of reagent to exclude the other reagent or to inhibit coaggregation.
TI  - Microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low pH isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  - Longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. Differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml) at pH levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both pH and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. Strains of Streptococcus and Neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at pH levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. The most commonly isolated streptococci were Streptococcus mitior and S. salivarius. S. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at pH 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. Veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at pH 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. Despite their known fluoride resistance, Actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. The pH of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at pH 6.0 was only 30% of that at pH 7.0. Representative strains of S. mutans, S. mitior, S. sanguis, and S. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the pH and fluoride levels of the medium on which they were initially isolated. Fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. The isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the pH range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. Fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric S. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. In the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may permit S. mitior to compete with S. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.
TI  - Adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by Streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - Several strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of Streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. Bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees C and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as the substrate. Mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. The greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with S. sanguis (biotype I), serotype b of S. mutans, and the fresh S. salivarius isolates. The lowest mean depletion was noted with S. mitis (15%) and biotype II S. sanguis (ca. 30%). The remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. In studies with S. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees C, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees C was very similar. On the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. With S. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. The extent of adsorption, however, was independent of pH's of 3.9 to 8.3. When a low concentration of S. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20 mug of lysozyme added per ml. Salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral microorganisms (A. viscosus WVU 626 and WVU 627, S. sanguis 73x11, S. mutans BHT, and S. salivarius NG) was similar to that of S. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. Lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees C. On the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. A comparison of pH and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (GlcNAc)(4) suggested that adsorption by S. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. The possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.
TI  - Enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - Certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. To determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees C to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. This treatment markedly reduced the numbers of Streptococcus mutans MT3 and JBP and S. sanguis FC-1 and C5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of S. mitis RE7, Actinomyces viscosus LY7 and CK-8, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, or B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. Heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees C for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min or 100 degrees C for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. This indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of S. mutans and S. sanguis. Treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. Thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the S. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of S. sanguis FC-1 but not that of S. sanguis C5. Treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. Treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. Exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. Collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.
TI  - A microbiological analysis of human early carious and non-carious fissures.
AB  - The fissure sampling technique consisted of removing the fissure using a bur in a high-speed handpiece with water spray and then suctioning the fissural contents and the water spray into a sterile sampling container. Sixty-eight teeth were sampled. Total bacterial counts, total streptococcal counts, and counts of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus faecalis, Actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacilli were performed on the fissural samples. There was a four-fold increase in the total number of microorganisms recovered from carious (N = 48) compared to non-carious (N = 20) fissures. S. mutans was the only microorganism common to all carious fissures.
TI  - Production of acids in rat dental plaque with or without Streptococcus mutans.
AB  
TI  - Microbial analyses of dental plaque of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) using fluorescent antibody techniques.
AB  - Selected microbial components in supragingival dental plaque from recently captured monkeys were determined. Using specific fluorescent antibody (FA) conjugates S. sanguis was found to constitute an average of 11.8% of all cells. The populations of Actinomyces accounted for 20.7% (range 5-31) with A. viscosus and A. naeslundii as predominant species. Few lactobacilli were encountered. S. mutans was not detected in any specimens when examined by culture and FA.
TI  - Ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  - This study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. Pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, and aliquots dispersed for 0-180 s, using an MSE sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2. Viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. Breakage of T. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. Gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than Gram-negative. A. viscous was more resistant than Strep sanguis. Gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. Eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by F. nucleatum B asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, A actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of Group IV Bacteroides, and B melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' Bacteroides and oral Campylobacter. T. denticola, Selenomonas sputigena and Wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. Recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
TI  - Lactose-reversible coaggregation between oral actinomycetes and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Freshly isolated strains of oral actinomycetes were obtained from human dental plaque and were tested for the ability to coaggregate with common laboratory stock strains of Streptococcus sanguis. Strains belonging to the genera Actinomyces, Arachnia, Bifidobacterium, and Bacterionema were isolated. Only members of the genus Actinomyces coaggregated with the streptococci, and only Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii exhibited lactose-reversible interactions. A total of 61 strains, consisting of all of the A. viscosus isolates and 86% of the A. naeslundii isolates, coaggregated; 87% inhibited lactose-reversible coaggregation. On the basis of this property and the altered ability of strains to coaggregate after heat treatment of the cells, we delineated four coaggregation groups. The other 13% of the strains constituted a fifth group, which was characterized by a pattern of closely related interactions that were not reversed by lactose. Compared with previously characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of actinomycetes, more than 80% of these fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregation properties. Thus, most of the coaggregation between freshly isolated oral actinomycetes and streptococci involves lactose-reversible cell-cell interactions, which suggests that such coaggregation is mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions between complementary cell surface structures on the two cell types.
TI  - Lectin-like constituents of foods which react with components of serum, saliva, and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Hot and cold aqueous extracts were prepared from 22 commonly ingested fruits, vegetables, and seeds. When tested by agar diffusion, extracts from 13 and 10 of the foods formed precipitin bands with samples of normal rabbit serum and human saliva, respectively; extracts from four of the foods also reacted with antigen extracts of strains of Streptococcus mutans. When added to rabbit antiserum, extracts from 18 of 21 foods tested inhibited reactivity with antigen extracts derived from S. mutans MT3. Extracts from 16 foods agglutinated whole S. mutans cells, whereas those from 10 foods agglutinated human erythrocytes of blood types A and B. The lectin-like activities of extracts which reacted with human saliva were studied further. Pretreatment of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA) beads with extracts of bananas, coconuts, carrots, alfalfa, and sunflower seeds markedly reduced the subsequent adsorption of S. mutans MT3. Pretreatment of S-HA with banana extract also strongly inhibited adsorption of S. mutans H12 and S. sanguis C1, but it had little effect on attachment of Actinomyces naeslundii L13 or A. viscosus LY7. Absorption experiments indicated that the component(s) in banana extract responsible for inhibiting streptococcal adsorption to S-HA was identical to that which bound to human erythrocytes. The banana hemagglutinin exhibited highest activity between pH 7 and 8, and it was inhibited by high concentrations of glucosamine, galactosamine, and, to a lesser extent, mannosamine. Other sugars tested had no effect. The selective bacterial adsorption-inhibiting effect noted for banana extract was also observed in studies with purified lectins. Thus, pretreating S-HA with wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A inhibited adsorption of S. mutans MT3 cells, whereas peanut agglutinin, Ulex agglutinin, Dolichos agglutinin, and soybean agglutinin had little effect; none of these lectins affected attachment of A. viscosus LY7. Collectively, the observations suggest that many foods contain lectins which can interact with components of human saliva and S. mutans cells. Because of their potential to influence host-parasite interactions in the mouth and elsewhere in the gastrointestinal canal, these reactions warrant further study.
TI  - Effect of bacterial aggregation on the adherence of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Several in vitro assay systems to measure the adherence of human dental plaque bacteria to solid surfaces such as teeth, glass, and hydroxyapatite have been published. In many studies a variety of macromolecular solutes have been used to study the adherence process. Often these solutes are able to aggregate the test bacterial and thus may alter the outcome of adherence experiments. In this study, the effects of the aggregation of Streptococcus sanguis on adherence to spheroidal hydroxyapatite is described. Adherence of preformed aggregates and of bacteria which were aggregating during the adherence reaction was examined. Bacteria were aggregated with whole saliva, concanavalin A, and wheat germ lectin. Further effects of the coaggregation of S. mitis and Actinomyces viscosus to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite are presented. These studies suggest that formation of large aggregates resulted in a decrease in the numbers of organisms which adhered. In contrast, the formation of small aggregates actually increased the numbers of bacteria that adhered. All increases in adherent bacteria occurred at low concentrations of aggregating substance in which visible bacterial aggregation was not evident. The data indicate that adequate dose-response experiments must be performed to ensure that solutes used as probes to study adherence mechanisms do not affect the adherence simply as a result of aggregation of the test microorganisms.
TI  - Interference of secretory immunoglobulin A with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The potential of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (HA) beads. The importance of specific S-IgA antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral S-IgA, polymeric myeloma IgA, or preabsorbed S-IgA. Specific antibody molecules bound at the HA surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two Streptococcus sanguis strains. In contrast, HA-bound S-IgA antibodies inhibited the sorption of Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. The same was true for Streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. Suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to HA. Comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of IgA or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with S-IgA or myeloma IgA added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with S. Sanguis, S. mitior, S. salivarius, and glucose-grown S. mutans was partly attributable to functions of S-IgA antibodies. Under the in vitro conditions of the study, S-IgA antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown S. mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii to HA. The results indicated that S-IgA can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to HA by several different functions.
TI  - Effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - We examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (S. mitis, A. viscosus, S. aureus, E. coli). We observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. Heat treatment (80 degrees C, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. Supplementation of saliva with H(2)O(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. S. mitis and A. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by H(2)O(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by S. mutans and S. mitis required ca. 10 muM H(2)O(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. Loss of the inhibitory action of saliva occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. Supplementation of saliva dilutions with SCN(-) and H(2)O(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca. 0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. We suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. Furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and SCN(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. The resistance of A. viscosus, S. aureus, and E. coli to the inhibitory potential of saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. The resistance of S. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on H(2)O(2) accumulation by this organism compared with S. mutans and S. sanguis. The basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. The role of the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.
TI  - Fluoride accumulation by oral microorganisms.
AB  - Ten laboratory strains of oral microorganisms and 17 recent clinical isolates were examined for their ability to concentrate fluoride from a 1 ppm (0.05 mM NaF( fluoride solution. The laboratory strains concentrated the ion from two- to six-fold over the surrounding media. Clinical isolates of Actinomyces concentrated the ion to similar levels to the laboratory strains of this organism; however, clinical isolates of Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis concentrated the fluoride significantly less than any of the laboratory strains examined.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: immunochemical studies of extracellular and cell-wall-associated antigens from Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Soluble extracellular antigens (ESA) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a Bio-Gel P6 column. Soluble cell wall antigens (WEA) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6). Antisera against whole cells of S. sanguis and S. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell walls, dextran, ESA, and WEA were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. ESA and WEA were prepared from a representative strain of Bratthall's seven serological groups, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus. All sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. The comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both ESA and WEA between the different strains. Absorption of anti-ESA sera with WEA, and anti-WEA sera with ESA, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. Enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in ESA and WEA.

TI  - Further characteristics of beta2-microglobulin binding to oral streptococci.
AB  - A total of 85 strains of oral bacteria representing Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. Mitior, S. salivarious, S. milleri, S. infrequens, S. durans, S. lactis, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. equinus, Streptococcus species group E, Actinomyces, and one group A Streptococcus were tested for binding of aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin. Positive affinity between bacteria and aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin was detected in 36% of the strains. No apparent correlation with bacterial species, serotype, or group was noted. No positive strains were detected among seven group I:A S. sanguis strains (P < 0.01). Binding constants for one S. mutans strain indicated heterogeneous binding structures on the bacterial surface. The number of binding sites for aggregates of human beta 2-microglobulin involving multipoint attachment varied from 70 to 1,700 per bacterial cell. With whole saliva as buffer, a general increase in affinity was seen. Variations in salt concentrations of the buffers revealed different salt-dependent species-associated uptake patterns. Oral bacteria tended to have an uptake maximum at a salt concentration similar to that seen in saliva. Binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on oral streptococci were sensitive to pepsin, heat, and formaldehyde treatment. Bacterial binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin might represent one of several factors of importance for bacterial attachment in the oral cavity. Experimental conditions reflecting the salivary milieu increased the degree of interaction, emphasizing the importance of physiological test systems for such studies.

TI  - Role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - The effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus T14V to tooth surfaces were assessed by using the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) in vitro system. Attachment to sHA by A. viscosus T14V was not inhibited in the presence of Streptococcus mutans GS5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. Precoating sHA beads with S. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain T14V attachment. However, the presence of Streptococcus sanguis M5 during strain T14V attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of A. viscosus T14V with sHA, whereas another S. sanguis strain, strain G9B, produced relatively weak inhibition. The inhibitory effect of S. sanguis M5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with A. viscosus T14V. Conversely, the presence of strain T14V markedly increased the attachment of S. sanguis M5 to sHA while partially inhibiting the attachment of S. sanguis G9B. Moreover, sHA beads precoated with A. viscosus T14V bound much higher levels of S. sanguis M5 relative to uncoated sHA, whereas S. sanguis G9B attachment was only weakly inhibited. It was also observed that sHA beads precoated with either S. sanguis M5 or G9B inhibited subsequent attachment by strain T14V. These results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both S. sanguis strains partially overlap those for A. viscosus T14V. Streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain T14V to sHA, and both Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. In addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of A. viscosus T14V to human epithelial cells.
TI  - Lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  - We assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. When the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. The Actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas Streptococcus sanguis, Campylobacter, and Eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. The response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. However, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. These results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease states.
TI  - Modulation of immunoreactivity to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms during pregnancy.
AB  - The lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. In addition, a group of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in response to the same stimulants. The stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides [Capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). Intrinsic (cells cultured in male AB plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. Additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. There was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. We propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.

TI  - The effect of intensive antibacterial therapy on the sulcular environment in monkeys. Part I. Changes in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus.
AB  - The changes induced in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus were evaluated as  part of a study considering the keratinizing potential of the sulcular epithelium when bacterial plaque was essentially eliminated. Two Rhesus monkeys were scaled and placed on a daily therapeutic regimen which included a prophylaxis, systemic tetracycline, and topical chlorhexidine. Over the 40 day experimental period and 74 days post-therapy, subgingival plaque samples were taken periodically. The plaque samples were cultured anaerobically and aerobically to determine the predominant bacterial flora. The total cultivable bacterial flora decreased from initial levels by greater than 99.9% with the antibacterial therapy. The flora shifted with therapy from one dominated by anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides melaninogenicus (18%) and Fusobacterium species (13.9%), to a flora dominated by organisms growing aerobically. During treatment B. melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium species were not detected in any sample. After cessation of all therapy the anaerobes increased to dominance again, but B. melaninogenicus remained undetectable through 74 days post-therapy.
TI  - Surface ultrastructure of some oral bacteria.
AB  - Adhesion of Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and an Actinomyces sp. to enamel and epon and their interspecies cohesion was studied with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. For adhesion studies enamel or epon was coated with salivary macromolecules and then cells of S. sanguis and in some experiments also with F. nucleatum or Actinomyces sp. Cells of S. sanguis were seen scattered over the surface of a thin "pellicle" that was heavily stained, and F. nucleatum and Actinomyces sp. adhered to S. sanguis or directly to the "pellicle". For studies of cohesion S. sanguis was brought to cohere with F. nucleatum or Actinomyces sp. and then processed for transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the cell surface structures involved was studied in negatively stained preparations or in thin sections of material treated with ruthenium red or poststained with uranyl and lead salts, phosphotungstic acid or periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium tetroxide. S. sanguis demonstrated a fuzzy coat of fimbriae that seemed to unfold in areas of contact with other cells, while cells of F. nucleatum had 6-10 polar pilus-like fimbriae, which appeared to be instrumental in cohesion, as did a dense coat of long, slender fimbriae that covered cells of Actinomyces sp.
TI  - Specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of Actinomyces viscosus or Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - Coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of Actinomyces viscosus or A. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of Streptococcus sanguis or S. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. Two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. Coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. The latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. Cells that could be heat inactivated also were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. Coaggregation reactions of each kind were Ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of S. sanguis and S. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.

TI  - In vitro evaluation of seven cationic detergents as antiplaque agents.
AB  - The bactericidal efficacy of seven cationic detergents was studied in vitro against intact performed plaques of representative strains of four oral dental plaque-forming microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Both absolute (plaque bactericidal index) and relative (chlorhexidine coefficient) indexes of antiplaque activity were established. Only cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was more efficacious than the reference agent, the bisbiguanide chlorhexidine, for the apparently more potent tooth-adherent cariogenic and periodontopathic elements, respectively, of the in vivo plaque microflora, S. mutans and A. viscosus.
TI  - Experimental transient bacteraemias in human subjects with clinically healthy gingivae.
AB  - Thirty-six subjects with no evidence of clinical gingival inflammation underwent  a standardized toothbrushing procedure. Blood specimens, obtained from a vein in the antecubital fossa during the last 30 seconds of brushing, were cultured under aerobic and stringent anaerobic conditions. Three subjects exhibited detectable bacteraemias, Propionibacterium sp. being isolated from two of the subjects, while Actinomyces sp., Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis were isolated from the third. The implications of these results are discussed.
TI  - Stability of the resident microflora and the bacteriocinogeny of Streptococcus mutans as factors affecting its establishment in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  - The outcome of the experimental implantation of Streptococcus mutans strains in humans and animals is unpredictable, and neither success nor failure can be explained. It seems logical to assume that, apart from dietary and host factors, the characteristics of the S. mutans strain involved and those of the resident plaque microflora are important in colonization. For example, previous work in this laboratory suggested that bacteriocin production accounts at least in part for the establishment of an invading bacterium in a microbial ecosystem. In the present study, a complex specific pathogen-free Ny plaque ecosystem was obtained by the inoculation of specific pathogen-free rats with Actinomyces viscosus Ny1 and S. sanguis Ny101, and the establishment of S. mutans in such rats was then examined. It was found that bacteriocinogenic (bac(+)) strains generally colonized in much higher proportions than non-bacteriocinogenic (bac(-)) strains. Moreover, the longer the delay in introducing S. mutans, the poorer was its establishment. Shortly after inoculation of strains Ny1 and Ny101, there is probably a transient state in which microbial equilibrium has not been reached, but later the specific pathogen-free Ny system attains a stable climax community which more strongly resists invaders. The ability of a number of S. mutans strains to establish in such a climax community was then examined, and it was found that bac(+) strains generally established at a higher level than did bac(-) strains. In summary, it was concluded that, although the bac(+) state is an important property in the successful invasion of a plaque by S. mutans, the stability of the resident microflora is also an important factor.

TI  - Bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Opsonization of Streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. Opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed Strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera from sham-immunized monkeys. Antibodies to Strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. There was little or no opsonization with Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei, Strep, sanguis and Strep. salivarius. The exception was Strep. CHT which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. The results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of Strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.
TI  - Selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by Streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and A. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (BGR) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. The bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type A or B reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the A and B antigenic determinants were not involved. The organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of BGR mucin molecules because preparations absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained BGR molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed BGR components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. Differences were even noted among S. mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. Immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of anti-human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. Mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to S. mutans H12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups played an essential role. Active cell metabolism was not required for BGR mucin binding; however, pretreatment of H12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees C for 15 min) reduced binding. Mucin labeled with [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to S. mutans H12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. Binding of [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. However, binding was inhibited by several amines. BGR salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.
TI  - Bacteriology of human experimental gingivitis: effect of plaque and gingivitis score.
AB  - The plaque flora isolated from discrete dentogingival sites during a human gingivitis experiment was analyzed as a function of the plaque score and of the gingivitis score. When the gingivitis score was plotted as a function of the plaque score, a nonbleeding gingivitis was associated with a proportional increase in the Actinomyces sp. at the expense of the Streptococcus sp. In particular, the percentage of Actinomyces israelii increased significantly, while the percent Streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly. A. israelii also increased significantly when a bleeding gingivitis developed. When the plaque score was plotted as a function of the gingivitis score, A. israelii increased significantly as the nonbleeding gingivitis developed, but A. viscosus and Bacteroides melaninogenicus increased significantly when the bleeding gingivitis developed. The availability of a sufficient number of plaques with a plaque score of 2.0 permitted the examination of the interrelationship of gingivitis and flora minus the effect of plaque biomass. The bacteriological profile showed that when bleeding occurred, the levels and proportions of A. viscosus and B. melaninogenicus increased significantly. These findings raise the possibility that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.
TI  - Mechanism of coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Streptococcus sanguis 34.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus T14V and Streptococcus sanguis 34 coaggregate by a mechanism which is not inhibited by 1 M NaCl, is dextran independent, requires calcium, is pH dependent with an optimum at pH 8.0 to 8.5, and appears to require the interaction of a protein or glycoprotein on A. viscosus with a carbohydrate on S. sanguis. The coaggregation is inhibited more than 80% by 0.01 M lactose, 0.02 M beta-methyl-D-galactoside, or 0.05 M D-galactose; inhibition of coaggregation was less than 10% in 0.1 M alpha-methyl-D-galactoside, melibiose, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose, and a number of monosaccharides. At very high concentrations of enzyme, protease from S. griseus destroyed the reactive site on A. viscosus but not on S. sanguis. Both were totally resistant to dextranase. Periodate (0.01 M; pH 4) inactivated both bacteria. The ability of S. sanguis to coaggregate with A. viscosus was not destroyed by phenol-water extraction at 65 degrees C for 15 min. When the bacteria were cultured under specified conditions, the coaggregation was highly reproducible. Under the same conditions, T14AV, the avirulent mutant of A. viscosus T14V, did not coaggregate with S. sanguis 34. Electron microscopic studies of coaggregates, labeled immunochemically with antibody to A. viscosus, indicated that fibrils on A. viscosus may be involved in the coaggregation.
TI  - Factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  - Various factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. When the pH of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. When the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture pH values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. Adjusting the final pH of these cultures to below 5.5 with HCl caused the cells to aggregate. Cells from unsupplemented cultures with final pH values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. Aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees C) occurred rapidly at pH values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher pH values. Aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low pH and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. Low pH values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
TI  - Binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by Streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  - Lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (GTase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)C]sucrose. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to GTase. These cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than did the cells of the remaining serotypes. Lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to GTase than did the controls without added enzyme. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of GTase. Lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. These results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated GTase does not create additional GTase binding sites in S. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. Ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the S. mutans strains after exposure to GTase. Of these species, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. Three mutant strains of S. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of GTase as the control. These results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of S. mutans. The results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than S. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free GTase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. The results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of S. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.
TI  - Activity of three 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives against in vitro dental plaque.
AB  - Three 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, assessed using an in vitro preformed dental plaque model system, were differentially inhibitory for four plaque-forming microorganisms.
TI  - Microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. Samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. Gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. Peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. Gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. Bacteriodes ochraceus, other Bacteroides species, Selenomonas sputigena, and Campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. Haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and Veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. The data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. This might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
TI  - Use of extractable adenosine triphosphate to estimate the viable cell mass in dental plaque samples obtained from monkeys.
AB  - The viable cell mass in plaque samples obtained from monkeys was estimated by determining the concentration of extractable adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and total cell mass was estimated by measuring the protein content. The results were expressed in terms of the specific ATP and protein contents of Streptococcus sanguis. The viable counts estimated by these techniques were comparable to or exceeded viable counts obtained by other investigators using conventional bacteriological methods.
TI  - Comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - The adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated HA surfaces for strain of Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii. The experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. Adsorption to untreated HA was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly Ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to HA. More complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated HA since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. This indicates that adsorbed salivary components on HA surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. Fewer cells of strains of S. mutans, S. salivarius, and A. naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated HA than to untreated HA because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. Substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, and A. viscosus adsorbed to saliva-treated HA because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the number of adsorption sites for these strains. The affinity constants for all but one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated HA than on untreated HA. The number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated HA more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. Although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of S. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated HA did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered HA surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.
TI  - Fimbriae of Actinomyces viscosus t14v: their relationship to the virulence-associated antigen and to coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguis 34.
AB  - 1) Fimbriae from A. viscosus T14V may be similar to those found on other bacteria. 2) The antigenic difference between virulent and avirulent A. viscosus T14 appears to be of a quantitative rather than a qualitative nature and is related to fimbriae and not to the cell wall polysaccharide. 3) Coaggregation between A. viscosus T14V and S. sanguis 34 is mediated by fimbriae on the former which have specificity for beta-linked galactosyl residues.
TI  - Plaque formation in vitro by Actinomyces viscosus in the presence of Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus, growing on a tooth in the presence of sucrose, slowly produced a loosely-attached plaque, the pH being 6.1 after 120 h. When the tooth was inoculated simultaneously with A. viscosus and either Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus mutans, firmly-adherent plaque was quickly formed and the pH fell below 5 after 33 h with the former Streptococcus and 24 h with the latter. A. viscosus disappeared from each mixed plaque by 120 h.
TI  - Attachment of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets.
AB  - This investigation examined the ability of cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal pockets. Of 48 asaccharolytic strains of B. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. Electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of B. melaninogenicus strains. Both asaccharolytic and fermentative B. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of several gram-positive bacteria tested, including Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. mitis. B. melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. Both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of B. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. Serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. These observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit the attachment of B. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. This was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of B. melaninogenicus 381-R were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. After 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. High numbers of B. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. These data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing Actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment and colonization of B. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. Similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.
TI  - Structural requirements of guanide, biguanide, and bisbiguanide agents for antiplaque activity.
AB  - The bactericidal efficacy of 16 guanide, biguanide, and bisbiguanide agents was studied in vitro against intact preformed plaques of four oral (plaque-forming) microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii. The activities of these agents were examined in relation to their molecular configurations. These studies indicated that the bis- and biguanide configurations are important for efficacy, as is the length of the alkyl side chain. No structural moiety determined efficacy by itself. Furthermore, the activities of these agents were studied to determine the minimal conditions (concentration, duration, and frequency) of treatment required for likely clinical efficacy. At least six agents were judged to have equal or greater efficacy than the reference agent, chlorhexidine digluconate. A plaque bactericidal index was derived for the most potent agents, and comparison to the bactericidal properties of chlorhexidine was expressed as a chlorhexidine coefficient.
TI  - Binding of lectins to Streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  - The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. Strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. Strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin RCA. S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. The S. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by Con A. The a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. Glucan from d and e strains of S. mutans and dextran T2000 were also precipitated by Con A. D-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by Con A and the agglutination of type d cells by D-galactose. The quantity of [acetyl-3H]Con A bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. Cells grown in sucrose medium bound more Con A than those grown in glucose medium. After treatment with dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more Con A. The binding of Con A to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of Con A to the antibody globulin on the cell surface. Con A bound to S. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in vitro adherence. Bound Con A also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
TI  - Sucrose metabolism in resting-cell suspensions of caries associated and non-caries-associated dental plaque.
AB  - Small specimens of cariogenic plaque (CP) and non-cariogenic plaque (NCP) from the same tooth were individually dispersed in buffer, divided equally, and incubated for 45 min with [(14)C]sucrose uniformly labeled either in the glucosyl moiety or the fructosyl moiety. Sucrose metabolism was analyzed periodically during an anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C. Radiochemical techniques were devised to analyze formation of lactic acid, soluble extracellular polysaccharide, total cell-bound and insoluble products, intracellular polysaccharide, lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism, insoluble extracellular glucan, CO(2), total volatile acids, individual volatile acids, and rates of sucrose consumption. The contribution of the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties of sucrose to each metabolic by-product was determined. All of the metabolic data were adjusted to the size of the plaque specimens as determined by colony-forming units, Coulter counter particle counts, and fluorometric protein analyses. Both types of dental plaque transformed from 70 to 80% of the consumed sucrose into lactic acid and cell-bound and insoluble products, primarily intracellular polysaccharide and extracellular glucan. Volatile acids accounted for most of the remaining by-products. CP metabolized significantly more sucrose than NCP and consequently produced significantly higher levels of each metabolic by-product. High levels of Streptococcus mutans were found in CP (averaging 40% of colony-forming units), whereas it was virtually absent in NCP. Actinomyces and S. sanguis levels were distinctly higher in NCP. NCP harbored more anaerobes and dextranase-forming microorganisms than CP.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of three iodine-containing compounds as antiplaque agents.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of three iodine-containing compounds was determined for strains of four dental plaque-forming microorganisms, using an in vitro preclinical plaque model system. Solutions of inorganic iodine, povidone-iodine, and Wescodyne were tested for antiplaque activity against preformed plaques of a number of strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Solutions of inorganic iodine were more effective as antiplaque agents, with respect to minimal bactericidal concentration and time and frequency of treatments, than solutions of Wescodyne and povidone-iodine. Inorganic iodine appeared to be particularly effective against the most cariogenic (S. mutans) and periodontopathic (A. viscosus) organisms while allowing survival of the least orally pathogenic plaque-forming microorganism (S. sanguis). It is suggested that topical application of solutions of inorganic iodine may be useful in controlling dental caries and actinomyces-associated periodontal disease.
TI  - Sucrose metabolism by prominent members of the flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaques.
AB  - Sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. Streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than S. sanguis, S. mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, or Lactobacillus casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. The Actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and S. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. The metabolic activity of S. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the Actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.
TI  - Comparison of antiplaque agents using an in vitro assay reflecting oral conditions.
AB  - An in vitro assay is described using saliva-treated bovine enamel slabs for determining the potential of chemotherapeutic agents to adsorb to tooth surfaces and act against plaque-forming bacteria. Chlorhexidine was found to inhibit the formation of in vitro plaque by Actinomyces viscosus, A naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans and S sanguis. Actinobolin was found to have marked antibacterial properties but limited adsorptive qualities.

TI  - Predominant cultivable microbiota in periodontosis.
AB  
TI  - Origin of esterases in human whole saliva.
AB  - Whole saliva of 59 healthy persons was used for determination of esterase activity. The pattern of esterase was studied by means of isoelectrofocusing on thin-layer acrylamide gels. The esterases found in whole saliva are suggested to be derived from the cells of the tissue in the oral cavity. This origin is indicated (e.g.) by comparison between isolectrophoretic esterase patterns of whole saliva, submandibular saliva, gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture. Antisera against partially purified saliva esterases were produced in rabbits. These sera, used in immunoelectro-osmophoresis, gave esterase-active immunoprecipitate against whole saliva, the water-soluble materials of disrupted gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture, but not against the material of the bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Strptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus and Lactobacillus fermentum.

TI  - Blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: characterization of bacterial sonicates.
AB  - Soluble sonicate supernatant preparations were made from Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 19246), A. naeslundii (ATCC 12104), two strains of Veillonella alcalescens (strain HV-1 and a human oral isolate), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC 10556), S. mutans (strain 6715-T2), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (strain K110), and Leptotrichia buccalis (isolated from human dental plaque). These supernatants were characterized with reference to their chemical and antigenic components and their biological activity determined by using in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis as a measure of the host's cellular immune response. The sonicate supernatant of each bacterium contained protein, neutral sugars, methylpentose, and nucleic acids. Protein was the major component in all except L. buccalis, in which neutral sugars predominated. The antigenic components in each supernatant were detected by using rabbit antisera prepared against the whole bacteria and the sonicate supernatant. The supernatants showed a complex antigenic distribution on immunoelectrophoretic analysis. The supernatants were shown to be antigenic and not mitogenic in nature, since neither cord blood lymphocytes nor all adult lymphocytes were stimulated. The supernatant antigen preparations showed a reproducible, dose-dependent, and kinetic response in vitro, which was similar to that seen with the antigen preparation streptokinase-streptodornase.
TI  - Initial colonization of teeth in monkeys as related to diet.
AB  - The initial phases of plaque development on nonretentive tooth surfaces were studied bacteriologically in Macaca irus monkeys fed by stomach tube and provided with various oral supplements. Except for the oral implantation of Streptococcus mutans in some of the animals, the oral flora was not changed prior to the studies. Dental plaque was allowed to develop on initially cleaned tooth surfaces for 3 to 5 h. Plaque samples were collected and cultured on a number of selective and nonselective agar media, and several hundred isolates from each sample were isolated and identified. The numerically predominant organisms in initial plaque were S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Actinomyces viscosus. Additional organisms regularly found, but usually in smaller numbers, were Streptococcus mitior and a group of fastidious gram-negative rods including Haemophilus species, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans. The colonization of S. mutans was dependent on sucrose and occurred at the expense of S. sanguis. In these experiments S. mutans accounted for 25 to 65% of the primary plaque formers. All other species encountered colonized the teeth irrespective of the diet. It is postulated that the early sucrose-dependent establishment of S. mutans directly on the enamel pellicle plays a key role in the development of a cariogenic plaque.
TI  - Susceptibility of some plaque microorganisms to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - Investigators have used chemotherapeutic agents topically for plaque control without knowing the drug concentration necessary to inhibit the growth of odontopathic microorganisms. S mutans, S sanguis, A viscosus and A naeslundii are important components of the plaque flora. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of niddamycin, vancomycin, bacitracin, and kanamycin were determined for each organism in liquid culture. These antibiotics were selected because of their low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Niddamycin, vancomycin, and bacitracin had the lowest MIC, from 0.2 to 10 units/ml. Kanamycin was inhibitory only at much higher concentrations (130 to 500 units/ml). The corresponding MBC was generally higher than the MIC. A viscosus was the most resistant organism tested. These data are important in designing controlled release devices for delivering a suitable antibiotic on a continuous basis intraorally.
TI  - Dextran-mediated interbacterial aggregation between dextran-synthesizing streptococci and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans bind to the surface of Actinomyces viscosus, producing large microbial aggregates. Aggregates form rapidly and are not easily dissociated by vigorous mixing. The binding is mediated by dextran. Glucose-grown streptococci will not aggregate unless they are first mixed with high-molecular-weight dextran. Aggregation is induced with dextrans isolated from Leuconostoc, S. sanguis, or S. mutans. Sucrose-grown streptococci will adhere to A. viscosus without the addition of an exogenous source of dextran. A. viscosus will bind dextran and then bind glucose-grown streptococci. Aggregation occurs over a wide pH range and is dependent on cations. The aggregating activity of A. viscosus is both protease and heat sensitive. The aggregating activity of S. sanguis is heat stable but sensitive to dextranase.

TI  - Evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic Streptococcus for production of IgA protease.
AB  - IgA protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma IgA of human origin to yield intact Fabalpha and Fcalpha fragments. To determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known Lancefield group serotype. Streptococci of groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, M, and N, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for IgA protease activity. Only S. sanguis and clinically isolated group H streptococci elaborated IgA protease under the culture conditions used. Negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory IgA. Among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce IgA protease is restricted to certain species of Streptococcus, notably those of the group H serotype. Since secretory immunity is mediated by the IgA class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.
TI  - Predominant cultivable flora isolated from human root surface caries plaque.
AB  - Plaque samples were obtained from tooth surfaces exhibiting typical lesions of root surface caries and were immediately cultured by a continuous anaerobic procedure. The bacterial composition of root caries flora was determined on individual samples. Representative isolates from each specimen were characterized by morphological and physiological criteria. In addition, fluorescent antibody reagents were used to confirm the identification of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus. The plaque samples could be divided into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of S. mutans in the plaque. In group I plaques, S. mutans comprised 30 percent of the total cultivable flora. S. sanguis was either not found or was present in very low number. In group II plaques, S. mutans was not detected, and S. sanguis formed 48 percent of the total plaque flora. A. viscosus was the dominant organism in all plaque samples, accounting for 47 percent of the group I isolates and 41 percent of the group II isolates.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of Streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  - An indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of Streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. An electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. This labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. Although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with S. salivarius and S. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. These cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. No cross-reactions occurred with S. mutans, S. faecalis, Actinomyces species, or Bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. Appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.

TI  - Mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic Streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
