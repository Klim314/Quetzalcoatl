TI  == respiratory microbiota dynamics following streptococcus pneumoniae acquisition in young and elderly mice.
AB  == the upper respiratory tract (urt) is a distinct microbial niche of low-density bacterial communities and, also, a portal of entry for many potential pathogens,  including streptococcus pneumoniae. thus far, animal models have been used to study the dynamics of and interactions between limited numbers of different species in the urt. here, we applied a deep sequencing approach to explore, for the first time, the impact of s. pneumoniae acquisition on urt microbiota in a mouse model, as well as potential age-dependent effects. young-adult and elderly  mice were inoculated intranasally with s. pneumoniae, and nasal lavage samples were collected for up to 28 days postcolonization. bacterial dna extracted from lavage samples was subjected to barcoded pyrosequencing of the v5-to-v7 hypervariable region of the small-subunit rrna gene. we observed highly diverse microbial profiles, with the presence overall of 15 phyla and approximately 645 operational taxonomic units (otus). we noted differences in the composition of microbiota between young and elderly mice, with a significantly higher abundance  of bacteroidetes in the young mice. the introduction of s. pneumoniae into the urt led to a temporary dominance of pneumococci in the microbiota of all mice, accompanied by a significant decrease in microbial diversity. as mice gradually cleared the colonization, the diversity returned to baseline levels. diversification was accompanied by an early expansion of bacteroidetes, staphylococcus spp., and lachnospiraceae. moreover, the bacteroidetes expansion was significantly greater in young-adult than in elderly mice. in conclusion, we  observed differences in urt microbiota composition between naive young-adult and  elderly mice that were associated with differences in pneumococcal clearance over time.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
