TI  - Substrate specificity of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum: toward a bio-based production of adipic acid.
AB  - Expression of six genes from two glutamate fermenting clostridia converted Escherichia coli into a producer of glutaconate from 2-oxoglutarate of the general metabolism (Djurdjevic, I. et al. 2010, Appl. Environ. Microbiol.77, 320-322). The present work examines whether this pathway can also be used to reduce 2-oxoadipate to (R)-2-hydroxyadipic acid and dehydrate its CoA thioester to 2-hexenedioic acid, an unsaturated precursor of the biotechnologically valuable adipic acid (hexanedioic acid). 2-Hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum, the key enzyme of this pathway and a potential radical enzyme, catalyzes the reversible dehydration of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA to (E)-glutaconyl-CoA. Using a spectrophotometric assay and mass spectrometry, it was found that (R)-2-hydroxyadipoyl-CoA, oxalocrotonyl-CoA, muconyl-CoA, and butynedioyl-CoA, but not 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, served as alternative substrates. Hydration of butynedioyl-CoA most likely led to 2-oxosuccinyl-CoA, which spontaneously hydrolyzed to oxaloacetate and CoASH. The dehydratase is not specific for the CoA-moiety because (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-thioesters of N-acetylcysteamine and pantetheine served as almost equal substrates. Whereas the related 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase generated the stable and inhibitory 2,4-pentadienoyl-CoA radical, the analogous allylic ketyl radical could not be detected with muconyl-CoA and 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase. With the exception of (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, all mono-CoA-thioesters of dicarboxylates used in this study were synthesized with glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans. The now possible conversion of (R)-2-hydroxyadipate via (R)-2-hydroxyadipoyl-CoA and 2-hexenedioyl-CoA to 2-hexenedioate paves the road for a bio-based production of adipic acid.
TI  - Analysis of the mobilization functions of the vancomycin resistance transposon Tn1549, a member of a new family of conjugative elements.
AB  - Conjugative transfer from Clostridium symbiosum to enterococci of Tn1549, which confers VanB-type vancomycin resistance, has been reported. This indicates the presence of a transfer origin (oriT) in the element. Transcription analysis of Tn1549 indicated that orf29, orf28, orfz, and orf27 were cotranscribed. A pACYC184 derivative containing 250 bp intergenic to orf29-orf30 of Tn1549 was mobilized in Escherichia coli recA::RP4::Delta nic provided that orf28 and orf29 were delivered simultaneously. These open reading frame (ORF) genes were able to promote mobilization in trans, but a cis-acting preference was observed. On the basis of a mobilization assay, a minimal 28-bp oriT was delimited, although the frequency of transfer was significantly reduced compared to that of a 130-bp oriT fragment. The minimal oriT contained an inverted repeat and a core, which was homologous to the cleavage sequence found in certain Gram-positive rolling-circle replicating (RCR) plasmids. While Orf29 was a mobilization accessory component similar to MobC proteins, Orf28 was identified as a relaxase belonging to a new phyletic cluster of the MOB(p) superfamily. The nick site was identified within oriT by an oligonucleotide cleavage assay. Closely related oriTs linked to mobilization genes were detected in data banks; they were found in various integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) originating mainly from anaerobes. These results support the notion that Tn1549 is a member of a MOB(p) clade. Interestingly, the Tn1549-derived constructs were mobilized by RP4 in E. coli, suggesting that a relaxosome resulting from DNA cleavage by Orf28 interacted with the coupling protein TraG. This demonstrates the capacity of Tn1549 to be mobilized by a heterologous transfer system.
TI  - Modular coenzyme specificity: a domain-swopped chimera of glutamate dehydrogenase.
AB  - Domain-swopped chimeras of the glutamate dehydrogenases from Clostridium symbiosum (CsGDH) (NAD(+)-specific) and Escherichia coli (EcGDH) (NADP(+)-specific) have been produced, with the aim of testing the localization of determinants of coenzyme specificity. An active chimera consisting of the substrate-binding domain (Domain I) of CsGDH and the coenzyme-binding domain (Domain II) of EcGDH has been purified to homogeneity, and a thorough kinetic analysis has been carried out. Results indicate that selectivity for the phosphorylated coenzyme does indeed reside solely in Domain II; the chimera utilizes NAD(+) at 0.8% of the rate observed with NADP(+), similar to the 0.5% ratio for EcGDH. Positive cooperativity toward L-glutamate, characteristic of CsGDH, has been retained with Domain I. An unforeseen feature of this chimera, however, is that, although glutamate cooperativity occurs only at higher pH values in the parent CsGDH, the chimeric protein shows it over the full pH range explored. Also surprising is that the chimera is capable of catalysing severalfold higher reaction rates (V(max)) in both directions than either of the parent enzymes from which it is constructed.
TI  - Allosteric behaviour of 1:5 hybrids of mutant subunits of Clostridium symbiosum glutamate dehydrogenase differing in their amino acid specificity.
AB  - Hybrid hexamers were made by refolding mixtures of two mutant forms of clostridial glutamate dehydrogenase. Mutant Cys320Ser (C320S) has a similar activity to the wild-type enzyme, but is unreactive with Ellman's reagent, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB). The triple mutant Lys89Leu/Ala163Gly/Ser380Ala (K89L/A163G/S380A), active with norleucine but not glutamate, is inactivated by DTNB, since the amino acid residue at position 320 is a cysteine residue. The chosen ratio favoured 1:5 hybrids of the triple mutant and C320S. The renatured mixture was treated with DTNB and separated on an NAD(+)-agarose column to which only C320S subunits bind tightly. Fractions were monitored for glutamate and norleucine activity and for releasable thionitrobenzoate to establish subunit stoichiometry. A fraction highly enriched in the 1:5 hybrid was identified. Homohexamers (C320S with 40 mM glutamate and 1 mM NAD(+) at pH 8.8, or K89L/A163G/S380A with 70 mM norleucine and 1 mM NAD(+) at pH 8.5) showed allosteric activation; succinate activated C320S approx. 50-fold (EC(50)=70 mM, h=2.4), and glutarate gave approx. 30-fold activation (EC(50)=35 mM, h=2.3). For the triple mutant, corresponding values were 80 mM and 2.2 for succinate, and 75 mM and 1.7 for glutarate, but maximal activation was only about 2-fold. In the 1:5 hybrid, with only one norleucine-active subunit per hexamer, responses to glutarate and succinate were still co-operative, and activation was more extensive than in the triple mutant homohexamer. A single norleucine-active subunit can thus respond co-operatively to a substrate analogue at the other five inactive sites. On the other hand, similar hyperbolic dependence on the norleucine concentration for the hybrid and the triple mutant homohexamer reflected the inability of C320S subunits to bind norleucine. With glutamate at pH 8.8, an h value of 3.6 was obtained for the 1:5 hybrid, in contrast with an h value of 5.2 for the C320S homohexamer. The "foreign" subunit evidently impedes inter-subunit communication to some extent.
TI  - Contribution of an aspartate residue, D114, in the active site of clostridial glutamate dehydrogenase to the enzyme's unusual pH dependence.
AB  - Glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium symbiosum displays unusual kinetic behaviour at high pH when compared with other members of this enzyme family. Structural and sequence comparisons with GDHs from other organisms have indicated that the Asp residue at position 114 in the clostridial enzyme may account for these differences. By replacing this residue by Asn, a mutant protein has been created with altered functional properties at high pH. This mutant protein can be efficiently overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and several criteria, including mobility in non-denaturing electrophoresis, circular dichroism (CD) spectra and initial crystallisation studies, suggest a folding and an assembly comparable to those of the wild-type protein. The D114N mutant enzyme shows a higher optimum pH for activity than the wild-type enzyme, and both CD data and activity measurements show that the distinctive time-dependent reversible conformational inactivation seen at high pH in the wild-type enzyme is abolished in the mutant.
TI  - NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase in the Antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium Psychrobacter sp. TAD1. Characterization, protein and DNA sequence, and relationship to other glutamate dehydrogenases.
AB  - The Antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium Psychrobacter sp. TAD1 contains two distinct glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH), each specific for either NADP+ or NAD+. This feature is quite unusual in bacteria, which generally have a single GDH. NADP+-dependent GDH has been purified to homogeneity and the gene encoding GDH has been cloned and expressed. The enzyme has a hexameric structure. The amino acid sequence determined by peptide and gene analyses comprises 447 residues, yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 49 285 Da. The sequence shows homology with hexameric GDHs, with identity levels of 52% and 49% with Escherichia coli and Clostridium symbiosum GDH, respectively. The coenzyme-binding fingerprint motif GXGXXG/A (common to all GDHs) has Ser at the last position in this enzyme. The overall hydrophilic character is increased and a five-residue insertion in a loop between two alpha-helices may contribute to the increase in protein flexibility. Psychrobacter sp. TAD1 GDH apparent temperature optimum is shifted towards low temperatures, whereas irreversible heat inactivation occurs at temperatures similar to those of E. coli GDH. The catalytic efficiency in the temperature range 10-30 degrees C is similar or lower than that of E. coli GDH. Unlike E. coli GDH the enzyme exhibits marked positive cooperativity towards 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH. This feature is generally absent in prokaryotic GDHs. These observations suggest a regulatory role for this GDH, the most crucial feature being the structural/functional properties required for fine regulation of activity, rather than the high catalytic efficiency and thermolability encountered in several cold-active enzymes.
TI  - The NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum islandicum: cloning, sequencing, and expression of the enzyme gene(1).
AB  - The NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum islandicum was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1266 bp encoding a protein of 421 amino acids with a molecular weight of 46,905. In the alignment of the amino acid sequence with those of mesophilic Clostridium symbiosum NAD-dependent GluDH and hyperthermophilic NADP-dependent enzymes from Thermococcus profundus and Pyrococcus furiosus, substitutions in the residues involved in dinucleotide binding were observed. On the other hand, the residues involved in glutamate binding were well conserved. This is the first description of the primary structure of NAD-dependent GluDH in hyperthermophilic archaea.
TI  - 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum.
AB  - Component D (HgdAB) of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium symbiosum was purified to homogeneity. It is able to use component A from Acidaminococcus fermentans (HgdC) to initiate catalysis together with ATP, Mg2+ and a strong reducing agent such as Ti(III)citrate. Component D from C. symbiosum has a 6 x higher specific activity compared with that from A. fermentans and contains a second [4Fe-4S] cluster but the same amount of riboflavin 5'-phosphate (1.0 per heterodimeric enzyme, m = 100 kDa). Mossbauer spectroscopy revealed symmetric cube-type structures of the two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. EPR spectroscopy showed the resistance of the clusters to reducing agents, but detected a sharp signal at g = 2. 004 probably due to a stabilized flavin semiquinone. Three genes from C. symbiosum coding for components D (hgdA and hgdB) and A (hgdC) were cloned and sequenced. Primer extension experiments indicated that the genes are transcribed in the order hgdCAB from an operon only half the size of that from A. fermentans. Sequence comparisons detected a close relationship to the dehydratase system from A. fermentans and HgdA from Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as to putative proteins of unknown function from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Lower, but significant, identities were found with putative enzymes from several methanogenic Archaea and Escherichia coli, as well as with the mechanistically related benzoyl-CoA reductases from the Proteobacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Thauera aromatica.
TI  - Pyruvate phosphate dikinase from a thermophilic actinomyces Microbispora rosea subsp. aerata: purification, characterization and molecular cloning of the gene.
AB  - Various thermophilic bacteria were analyzed by Southern hybridization analysis using oligonucleotide probes coding for the pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) gene from Clostridium symbiosum, and positive hybridization signals were observed in the chromosomal DNAs from Microbispora rosea subsp. aerata (IFO 14047). PPDK activity was detected in lactose induced cells and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of PPDK was estimated to be 230000 by gel filtration chromatography and 91000 by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that PPDK is a dimeric enzyme. This enzyme was specific for adenine nucleotide and the apparent Km values for AMP, PPi, and phosphoenolpyruvate were 5, 38, and 280 microM, respectively. It was stable in the pH range 6 to 11, and retained 80% activity after 60 min heat treatment at 60 degrees C. We cloned the PPDK gene from M. rosea. It consists of 878 amino acids with a molecular mass of 95514. Sequence comparison indicates around 50% similarity with other PPDKs and it has all the highly conserved regions of the related enzymes. We expressed the PPDK gene in Escherichia coli and obtained enzymatically active protein.
TI  - Insights into the molecular basis of thermal stability from the analysis of ion-pair networks in the glutamate dehydrogenase family.
AB  - The recent structure determination of glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus and the comparison of this structure with its counterparts from the mesophiles Clostridium symbiosum and Escherichia coli has highlighted the formation of extended networks of ion-pairs as a possible explanation for the superior thermal stability of the hyperthermostable enzyme. In the light of this, we have carried out a homology-based modelling study using sequences of a range of glutamate dehydrogenases drawn from species which span a wide spectrum of optimal growth temperatures. We have attempted to analyse the extent of the formation of ion-pair networks in these different enzymes and tried to correlate this with the observed thermal stability. The results of this analysis indicate that the ion-pair networks become more fragmented as the temperature stability of the enzyme decreases and are consistent with a role for the involvement of such networks in the adaptation of enzymes to extreme temperatures.
TI  - A monomeric mutant of Clostridium symbiosum glutamate dehydrogenase: comparison with a structured monomeric intermediate obtained during refolding.
AB  - The refolding of Clostridium symbiosum glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) involves the formation of an inactive structured monomeric intermediate prior to its concentration-dependent association. The structured monomer obtained after removal of guanidinium chloride was stable and competent for reconstitution into active hexamers. Site-directed mutagenesis of C. symbiosum gdh gene was performed to replace the residues Arg-61 and Phe-187 which are involved in subunit-subunit interactions, as determined by three-dimensional structure analysis. Heterologous over-expression in Escherichia coli of the double mutant (R61E/F187D) led to the production of a soluble protein with a molecular mass consistent with the monomeric form of clostridial GDH. This protein is catalytically inactive but cross-reacts with an anti-wild-type GDH antibody preparation. The double mutant R61E/F187D does not assemble into hexamers. The physical properties and the stability toward guanidinium chloride and urea of R61E/F187D were studied and compared to those of the structured monomeric intermediate.
TI  - Alteration of the quaternary structure of glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium symbiosum by a single mutation distant from the subunit interfaces.
AB  - X-ray crystallographic studies have previously shown that glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium symbiosum is a homohexamer. Mutation of the active-site aspartate-165 to histidine causes an alteration in the structural properties of the enzyme. The mutant enzyme, D165H exists predominantly as a single species of lower molecular mass than the wild-type enzyme as indicated by gel filtration and sedimentation velocity analysis. The latter technique gives an S20,w value for D165H of (6.07 +/- 0.01)S which compares with (11.08 +/- 0.01)S for the wild-type, indicative of alteration of the homohexameric quaternary structure of the native enzyme to a dimeric form, a result confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Further support for this is provided by chemical modification by Ellman's reagent of cysteine-144 in the mutant, a residue which is buried at the dimer-dimer interface in the wild-type enzyme and is normally inaccessible to modification. The results suggest a possible structural route for communication between the active sites and subunit interfaces which may be important for relaying signals between subunits in allosteric regulation of the enzyme.
TI  - Construction of a dimeric form of glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium symbiosum by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - By using site-directed mutagenesis, Phe-187, one of the amino-acid residues involved in hydrophobic interaction between the three identical dimers comprising the hexamer of Clostridium symbiosum glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), has been replaced by an aspartic acid residue. Over-expression in Escherichia coli led to production of large amounts of a soluble protein which, though devoid of GDH activity, showed the expected subunit M(r) on SDS-PAGE, and cross-reacted with an anti-GDH antibody preparation in Western blots. The antibody was used to monitor purification of the inactive protein. F187D GDH showed altered mobility on non-denaturing electrophoresis, consistent with changed size and/or surface charge. Gel filtration on a calibrated column indicated an M(r) of 87000 +/- 3000. The mutant enzyme did not bind to the dye column routinely used in preparing wild-type GDH. Nevertheless suspicions of major misfolding were allayed by the results of chemical modification studies: as with wild-type GDH, NAD+ completely protected one-SH group against modification by DTNB, implying normal coenzyme binding. A significant difference, however, is that in the mutant enzyme both cysteine groups were modified by DTNB, rather than C320 only. The CD spectrum in the far-UV region indicated no major change in secondary structure in the mutant protein. The near-UV CD spectrum, however, was less intense and showed a pronounced Phe contribution, possibly reflecting the changed environment of Phe-199, which would be buried in the hexamer. Sedimentation velocity experiments gave corrected coefficients S20,W of 11.08 S and 5.29 S for the wild-type and mutant proteins. Sedimentation equilibrium gave weight average molar masses M(r,app) of 280000 +/- 5000 g/mol. consistent with the hexameric structure for the wild-type protein and 135000 +/- 3000 g/mol for F187D. The value for the mutant is intermediate between the values expected for a dimer (98000) and a trimer (147000). To investigate the basis of this, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed over a range of protein concentrations. M(r,app) showed a linear dependence on concentration and a value of 108 118 g/mol at infinite dilution. This indicates a rapid equilibrium between dimeric and hexameric forms of the mutant protein with an equilibrium constant of 0.13 l/g. An independent analysis of the radial absorption scans with Microcal Origin software indicated a threefold association constant of 0.11 l/g. Introduction of the F187D mutation thus appears to have been successful in producing a dimeric GDH species. Since this protein is inactive it is possible that activity requires subunit interaction around the 3-fold symmetry axis. On the other hand this mutation may disrupt the structure in a way that cannot be extrapolated to other dimers. This issue can only be resolved by making alternative dimeric mutants.
TI  - Insights into the molecular basis of thermal stability from the structure determination of Pyrococcus furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase.
AB  - The structure determination of the glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus has been completed at 2.2 A resolution. The structure has been compared with the glutamate dehydrogenases from the mesophiles Clostridium symbiosum, Escherichia coli and Neurospora crassa. This comparison has revealed that the hyperthermophilic enzyme contains a striking series of networks of ion-pairs which are formed by regions of the protein which contain a high density of charged residues. Such regions are not found in the mesophilic enzymes and the number and extent of ion-pair formation is much more limited. The ion-pair networks are clustered at both inter domain and inter subunit interfaces and may well represent a major stabilising feature associated with the adaptation of enzymes to extreme temperatures.
TI  - Exchange of domains of glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus and the mesophilic bacterium Clostridium difficile: effects on catalysis, thermoactivity and stability.
AB  - The glutamate dehydrogenase gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus has been functionally expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the lambda PL promoter. The P. furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase amounted to 20% of the total E. coli cell protein, and the vast majority consisted of hexamers. Following activation by heat treatment, an enzyme could be purified from E. coli that was indistinguishable from the glutamate dehydrogenase purified from P. furiosus. Hybrid genes, that consisted of the coding regions for the homologous glutamate dehydrogenases from P. furiosus and the mesophilic bacterium Clostridium difficile, were constructed and successfully expressed in E. coli. One of the resulting hybrid proteins, containing the glutamate binding domain of the C. difficile enzyme and the cofactor binding domain of the P. furiosus enzyme, did not show a detectable activity. In contrast, the complementary hybrid containing the P. furiosus glutamate and the C. difficile cofactor binding domain was a catalytically active hexamer that showed a reduced substrate affinity but maintained efficient cofactor binding with the specificity found in the Clostridium symbiosum enzyme. Compared with the C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase, the archaeal-bacterial hybrid is slightly more thermoactive, less thermostable but much more stable towards guanidinium chloride-induced inactivation and denaturation.
TI  - Location of the catalytic site for phosphoenolpyruvate formation within the primary structure of Clostridium symbiosum pyruvate phosphate dikinase. 2. Site-directed mutagenesis of an essential arginine contained within an apparent P-loop.
AB  - Pyruvate phosphate dikinase catalyzes the interconversion of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), orthophosphate (P(i)), and pyruvate with adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), pyrophosphate (PP(i)), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The Arg 561 residue of Clostridium symbiosum PPDK is contained within a Gly-rich stretch of sequence spanning positions 553-563 (viz., GAEGIGLCRTE) located in the 35 kDa C-terminal domain of the enzyme. The possible role of this stretch of sequence as a phosphate binding loop participating in catalysis of the PEP/pyruvate partial reaction (viz., E+PEP<-->E-P+pyruvate, where E-P represents enzyme phosphorylated at the catalytic histidine) was deduced from the similarity of this sequence to other known phosphate binding loops and by its location in the 35 kDa PEP/pyruvate binding domain of PPDK. To test the proposed role of Arg 561, and hence, the signature sequence, in catalysis of the E+PEP<-->E-P+pyruvate partial reaction, the C. symbiosum PPDK site-directed mutants Arg 561-->Leu 561 and Arg 561-->Lys 561 were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli JM101. Neither mutant catalyzed the full PPDK reaction, ATP+P(i)+pyruvate<-->AMP+PP(i)+PEP, but both catalyzed the E+ATP+P(i)<-->E-P+AMP+PP(i) partial reaction as efficiently as wild-type PPDK. Both mutants were shown to be unable to catalyze the PEP/pyruvate partial reaction. On the basis of these results it was proposed that Arg 561 and, possibly, the Gly-rich stretch of sequence spanning positions 553-563 are essential components of the active site of the PEP/pyruvate partial reaction.
TI  - The changed pattern of substrate specificity in the K89L mutant of glutamate dehydrogenase of Clostridium symbiosum.
AB  
TI  - Identification of potential active-site residues in the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.
AB  - The carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) exhibits sequence homology with the NAD(P)(+)-dependent leucine and glutamate dehydrogenases. To clarify the role played by some conserved residues between PARP and NAD(P)(+)-dependent dehydrogenases, point mutations were introduced into the whole enzyme context. Non-conservative mutations of Lys-893 (K893I) and Asp-993 (D993A) completely inactivate human PARP, whereas conservative and nonconservative mutations of Asp-914 (D914E and D914A, respectively) and Lys-953 (K953R and K953I, respectively) partially alter PARP activity. The consequences of conservative substitution of Lys-893 and Asp-993 on the kinetic properties of human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme and the polymer it synthesizes suggest that these 2 amino acids are directly involved in the covalent attachment of the first ADP-ribosyl residue from NAD+ onto the acceptor amino acid. In addition, the recent resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the NAD(+)-linked glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium symbiosum (Baker, P.J., Britton, K.L., Engel, P.C., Farrants, G.W., Lilley, K.S., Rice, D.W., and Stillman, T.J. (1992) Proteins 12, 75-86) strongly supports our alignment with leucine and glutamate dehydrogenases and provides an interesting structural framework for the analysis of our results of site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - Characterization of the covalent enzyme intermediates formed during pyruvate phosphate dikinase catalysis.
AB  - The intermediacy of a pyrophosphorylenzyme (E-PP) and phosphorylenzyme (E-P) in the Clostridium symbiosum pyruvate phosphate dikinase catalyzed interconversion of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), orthophosphate (Pi), and pyruvate with adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) was examined using transient kinetic techniques. Single-turnover experiments with [gamma-32P]ATP or [14C]ATP and PPDK were carried out in the presence and absence of Pi to test for pyrophosphorylenzyme and AMP formation, respectively. Formation of the E-PP.AMP complex was found to be followed by Pi binding and the formation of the E-P.AMP.PPi complex. The level of pyrophosphorylenzyme accumulated during a single turnover was found to be dependent on the divalent metal cofactor used (Mn2+ > Co2+ > Mg2+). Single-turnover experiments with [32P]PEP and PPDK were carried out in the presence and absence of PPi and pyruvate to test for phosphorylenzyme formation in the reverse, ATP-forming direction of the reaction. Phosphorylenzyme formed from the reaction of the E.PEP complex was converted in the presence of AMP and PPi to free enzyme at a rate exceeding the steady-state turnover rate. The reaction sequence for pyruvate phosphate dikinase was determined to be [formula see text] 31P NMR analysis of the phosphorylenzyme in the native (-4.0 ppm) and denatured form (-3.9 ppm) revealed a 3-N-phosphohistidine residue. Complexation of Mg2+ resulted in a 0.3 ppm upfield shift of the phosphorus resonance from native phosphorylenzyme while Mn2+ complexation lead to extensive line broadening, indicative of metal cofactor binding in close vicinity to the phosphoryl group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Purification and properties of NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase from Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1.
AB  - Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (L-glutamate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, deaminating, EC  1.4.1.4) from the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens has been purified and characterized. The native enzyme and subunit are 280 and 48 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the native enzyme is a hexamer. The enzyme requires 0.5 M KCl for optimal activity and has a pH optimum of 6.9 to 7.0. The Kms for ammonia, alpha-ketoglutarate, and glutamate are 19, 0.41, and 62 mM, respectively. The sigmoidal NADPH saturation curve revealed positive cooperativity for the binding of this coenzyme. The first residue in the N-terminal amino acid sequence from R. flavefaciens GDH was alanine, suggesting that the protein may be modified posttranslationally. Comparison of the N-terminal sequence with those of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Clostridium symbiosum revealed only 39% amino acid homologies. The GDH from R. flavefaciens was unique in that its specific activity was highest during ammonia-limited growth but was not affected by ammonia shock treatment (20 mM).
TI  - The glutamate dehydrogenase gene of Clostridium symbiosum. Cloning by polymerase  chain reaction, sequence analysis and over-expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding the NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) of Clostridium symbiosum was cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because it could not be recovered by standard techniques. The nucleotide sequence of the gdh gene was determined and it was overexpressed from the controllable tac promoter in Escherichia coli so that active clostridial GDH represented 20% of total cell protein. The recombinant plasmid complemented the nutritional lesion of an E. coli glutamate auxotroph. There was a marked difference between the nucleotide compositions of the coding region (G + C = 52%) and the flanking sequences (G + C = 30% and 37%). The structural gene encoded a polypeptide of 450 amino acid residues and relative molecular mass (M(r) 49,295 which corresponds to a single subunit of the hexameric enzyme. The DNA-derived amino acid sequence was consistent with a partial sequence from tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides of the clostridial enzyme. The N-terminal amino acid sequence matched that of the purified protein, indicating that the initiating methionine is removed post-translationally, as in the natural host. The amino acid sequence is similar to those of other bacterial GDHs although it has a Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Ala motif in the NAD(+)-binding domain, which is more typical of the NADP(+)-dependent enzymes. The sequence data now permit a detailed interpretation of the X-ray crystallographic structure of the enzyme and the cloning and expression of the clostridial gene will facilitate site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - Effect of intestinal bacteria on the virulence of Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - The effect on amebal virulence of Escherichia coli, Clostridium symbiosum and a mixture of lactobacilli was investigated. Amebas from HM1 and HK axenic strains were incubated with a single bacterial strain or lactobacilli for short, intermediate, or long periods and analyzed for their erythrophagocytosis, hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity in vitro and hepatic abscesses formation in vivo. It was found that in vitro virulence was enhanced by all studied bacteria in HK9 but not in HM1 strains, which only showed an increase in cytotoxicity. The virulence in vivo was solely increased in trophozoites of HM1 strain by all tested bacteria.
TI  - The partial amino acid sequence of the NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Clostridium symbiosum: implications for the evolution and structural basis of coenzyme specificity.
AB  - The amino acid sequence is reported for CNBr and tryptic peptide fragments of the NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Clostridium symbiosum. Together with the N-terminal sequence, these make up about 75% of the total sequence. The sequence shows extensive similarity with that of the NADP(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli (52% identical residues out of the 332 compared) allowing confident placing of the peptide fragments within the overall sequence. This demonstrated sequence similarity with the E. coli enzyme, despite different coenzyme specificity, is much greater than the similarity (31% identities) between the GDH's of C. symbiosum and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, both NAD(+)-linked. The evolutionary implications are discussed. In the 'fingerprint' region of the nucleotide binding fold the sequence Gly X Gly X X Ala is found, rather than Gly X Gly X X Gly. The sequence found here has previously been associated with NADP+ specificity and its finding in a strictly NAD(+)-dependent enzyme requires closer examination of the function of this structural motif.
TI  - In vitro activity of nalidixic acid and its iron (III) complex on Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the antibacterial agent nalidixic acid (HNal) and its iron (III) complex (FeNal) against Entamoeba histolytica HM1 strain trophozoites in axenic or monoxenic (associated with Clostridium symbiosum) cultures was investigated. Using a dilution test with TYI-S-33 medium, this protozoan was found to be susceptible to both drugs, but FeNal showed amoebicidal activity only at concentrations higher than those used with HNal.
