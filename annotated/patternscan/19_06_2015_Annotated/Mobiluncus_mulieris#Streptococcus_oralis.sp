TI  == [analysis of community composition in dental plaque of elder people with root caries].
AB  == objective: to analyze the community in dental plaque of elder people with root caries. methods: total dnas were extracted from the root caries dental plaques of nine elders over 60 years of age. polymerase chaid reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to analyze the microbial composition, dgge bands were excised from the gels for sequencing and identification. results: the dominant genus in root caries dental plaque of elder people were: acinetobacte [0.9% (1/114)], actinobaculum [1.8% (2/114)], actinomyces [15.8% (18/114)], aggregatibacter [0.9% (1/114)], capnocytophaga [14.0% (16/114)], corynebacterium [0.9% (1/114)], haemophilus [0.9% (1/114)], mobiluncus [0.9% (1/114)], naxibacter [0.9% (1/114)], neisseriaceae [10.5% (12/114)], porphyromonas [0.9% (1/114)], prevotella [12.3% (14/114)], selenomonas [6.1% (7/114)], staphylococcus [1.8% (2/114)], oralis streptococcus [6.1% (7/114)], mutans streptococcu [7.9% (9/114)], tannerella [0.9% (1/114)], treponema [1.8% (2/114)], veillonella [10.5% (12/114)] and two uncultured unknown genus [1.8% (2/114)]. uncultred genotypes accounted for 19.30% of the total. gram-positive bacteria genotype accounted for 31.6% (36/114), and gram-negative bacteria genotype accounted for 66.7% (76/114). conclusions: there were many bacteria genotypes in root caries dental plaque in the elderly, which were widely distributed. gram-negative bacteria accounted for the majority. genotype-specific pathogenic bacteria were not found.
