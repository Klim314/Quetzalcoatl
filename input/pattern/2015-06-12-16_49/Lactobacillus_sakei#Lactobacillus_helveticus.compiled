TI  - Molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of Russia.
AB  - Russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. However, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resources and analyzing the LAB composition of Russian traditional fermented dairy foods. In the present study, we cultured LAB isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from Kalmykiya, Buryats, and Tuva regions of Russia. Seven lactobacillus species and the Bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative PCR. The LAB counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/mL (or per gram). In total, 599 LAB strains were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. The identified LAB belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16S rRNA and murE gene sequencing and multiplex PCR assay. The predominant LAB isolates were Lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. The quantitative PCR results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and Bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (Lactobacillus helveticus in Tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (Lactobacillus acidophilus in Kalmykiya) log cfu/mL of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). The numbers of Bifidobacterium spp., Lb. plantarum, Lb. helveticus, and Lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Russia have complex compositions of LAB species. The diversity of LAB might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.
TI  - A methodological approach to screen diverse cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds.
AB  - Microorganisms play an important role in the development of cheese flavor. The aim of this study was to develop an approach to facilitate screening of various cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds. We combined i) curd-based slurry medium incubated under conditions mimicking cheese manufacturing and ripening, ii) powerful method of extraction of volatiles, headspace trap, coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-trap-GC-MS), and iii) metabolomics-based method of data processing using the XCMS package of R software and multivariate analysis. This approach was applied to eleven species: five lactic acid bacteria (Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus helveticus), four actinobacteria (Brachybacterium articum, Brachybacterium tyrofermentans, Brevibacterium aurantiacum, and Microbacterium gubbeenense), Propionibacterium freudenreichii, and Hafnia alvei. All the strains grew, with maximal populations ranging from 7.4 to 9.2 log (CFU/mL). In total, 52 volatile aroma compounds were identified, of which 49 varied significantly in abundance between bacteria. Principal component analysis of volatile profiles differentiated species by their ability to produce ethyl esters (associated with Brachybacteria), sulfur compounds and branched-chain alcohols (H. alvei), branched-chain acids (H. alvei, P. freudenreichii and L. paracasei), diacetyl and related carbonyl compounds (M. gubbeenense and L. paracasei), among others.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of probiotic properties of Lactobacilli isolated from rat fecal microbiota.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to characterize lactobacilli isolates from the feces of male Wistar rats. Various physiological features of the candidate probiotic isolates were preliminarily investigated, including tolerance to simulated gastric juice and bile salts, antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and in vitro aggregation. Based on their morphological and biochemical characteristics, four potential probiotic isolates (CS2, CS3, CS4, and CS7) were screened. The isolates showed good tolerance to stimulated gastric juice and bile salts. CS4 and CS7 exhibited strong antibacterial activities against the pathogens tested as assessed in neutral pH culture supernatants. All lactobacilli isolates were susceptible to all the tested antibiotics, except vancomycin. Moreover, the isolate CS4 and CS7 were found to possess stronger cell surface traits such as hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation and co-aggregation capacity. In addition, CS4 and CS7 had greater beta-galactosidase activities than the others. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that CS2, CS3, CS4 and CS7 are Lactobacillus intestinalis PJ2, L. sakei PJ3, L. helveticus PJ4, and L. plantarum PJ7, respectively. Based on the obtained results, L. helveticus PJ4 and L. plantarum PJ7 are ideal in vitro probiotic candidates and require further in vivo evaluation.
TI  - Diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal Lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with BMI and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. The BMI (P < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (P < 0.01 by bacteriology; P < 0.001 by real-time PCR) were higher in the elderly. The number of species in adults was lower (P < 0.05), who were more often colonised with Lactobacillus acidophilus (P = 0.031) and L. helveticus (P < 0.001). In contrast, L. plantarum (P = 0.035), L. paracasei (P < 0.001) and L. reuteri (P = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. L. rhamnosus was detected in adults (P < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. BMI was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (P = 0.008). The higher BMI in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and L. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. Plasma glucose values were positively correlated with BMI and negatively correlated with colonisation with L. paracasei (P = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with L. fermentum (P = 0.052) in the elderly. Thus, the species-specific PCR analysis of Lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. The higher counts of intestinal Lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher BMI and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Growth characterization of individual rye sourdough bacteria by isothermal microcalorimetry.
AB  - AIMS: The present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. Another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains of the individual LAB isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kGy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. Sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. The OD-time curves of the LAB strains during growth in flour extract or MRS (De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe) broth were also determined. The maximum specific growth rates of Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus curvatus and Leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus panis, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial sourdough. Industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below pH 4.8. It was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the O(2) protective effect of rye sourdough. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the LAB strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.
TI  - Use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  - Conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (Kohonen Self Organizing Map) and supervised (Bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus including 47 reference strains. Electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by Piraino et al. [Piraino, P., Ricciardi, A., Lanorte, M. T., Malkhazova, I., Parente, E., 2002. A new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. Biotechnol. Lett. 24, 1477-1482]. Hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (Leuconostoc, Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus, Lb. plantarum/Lb. paraplantarum, Lc. lactis/Lc. raffinolactis). A 7x7 Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. The map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. Two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 Bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of SDS-PAGE patterns of Lc. lactis from those of other species. We conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
TI  - Use of hydrolysates from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) viscera as a complex nitrogen source for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Hydrolysates of cod viscera were tested as an alternative to commonly used complex nitrogen sources (peptones and/or extracts) for the type strains of the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Comparative studies with MRS-like media containing different nitrogen sources showed that all the fish hydrolysates performed equally well or better than commercial extracts/peptones for all selected lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Biodegradability of food-associated extracellular polysaccharides.
AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on humans. Although the biodegradability of EPSs is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. Therefore, the biodegradability of eight EPSs, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. EPS-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Xanthan, clavan, and the EPSs produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi 39 and SFi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the EPSs produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris B40, Lactobacillus sakei 0-1, S. thermophilus SFi20, and Lactobacillus helveticus Lh59. Clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.
