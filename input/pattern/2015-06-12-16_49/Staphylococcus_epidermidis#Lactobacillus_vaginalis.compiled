TI  - Comparisons of the bacterial flora in genital regions at non-pregnancy.
AB  - In the development of infectious diseases at non-pregnancy and at pregnancy, correlations between bacterial flora in the vagina and portio vaginalis and the ascending infections of those bacteria have recently been discussed. To clarify the cause of those infectious diseases, we studied the localization of microorganisms in genital regions. Patients undergone abdominal total hysterectomy (n = 172) were employed as subjects, and microorganisms isolated from 4 genital regions were studied. In addition, the preventive effect of cefmetazole (CMZ) against postoperative infections was analyzed in 479 cases including the hysterectomy cases mentioned above. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The isolation rate of microorganisms at non-pregnancy, from subjects of 30 to 69 years old, was 65.6% (82/125) in the vagina and portio vaginalis, 52.1% (25/48) in the cervical mucus, 7.3% (9/124) in the uterine cavity and 0% (0/47) in the ovarian surface. 2. Numbers of microorganisms isolated in each region were 99 strains in the vagina and portio vaginalis, 28 in the cervical mucus, 10 in the uterine cavity and none in the ovarian surface. Isolation of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria (60-89.3%) and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (7.1-30%) were varied in each region. Lactobacillus spp. (38 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (20 strains) and Propionibacterium acnes (10 strains) were isolated from vagina and portio vaginalis, and Lactobacillus spp. (17 strains) were the most often isolated bacteria from the cervical mucus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine gluconate douche on normal vaginal flora.
AB  - The effects of a 0.5% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) douche on the normal  vaginal flora of twenty healthy nonpregnant volunteers were investigated. The douche was applied in a premeasured 180-ml quantity daily for 7 consecutive days. Specimens for aerobic and anaerobic culture of the vaginal flora were obtained on 3 occasions from each volunteer, once before and twice after CHG use. The culture results were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. A blood sample was also collected within 24 h of the last CHG application to determine serum CHG concentration. Lactobacillus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most prevalent aerobic bacteria at all phases of the study and Bacteroides spp. were the most prevalent anaerobes. The composition of the normal flora was essentially the same 30 days after the last dose as the pretreatment flora. Small amounts of CHG were detected in the serum of all but one subject. No untoward effects on the participants were observed. Candida albicans counts were slightly higher, but prevalence was not significantly increased at the end of the study.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.
TI  - The acute urethral syndrome in routine practice.
AB  - Midstream samples of urine from 185 acutely dysuric women and 89 symptom-free controls were screened according to the modified criteria of Kass by both conventional and microaerophilic culture. Among the 185 symptomatic women, coliform bacilli were isolated from 125 (67.5%) and in 45 (36%) of the latter the concentration of these organisms in the urine was less than 10(8)/l. Fastidious organisms were isolated in pure and mixed cultures from 25 (13.4%) of the 185 patients and from 4 (4.5%) of 89 controls. Staphylococcus species were isolated from 10.8% (9.7% S. saprophyticus; 1.1% S. epidermidis) and Ureaplasma urealyticum from 2.7%. All patients infected with conventional organisms but only 30.4% of those yielding fastidious organisms had pyuria. The isolation rate of fastidious organisms tended to be higher (P = 0.055) in symptomatic women that in symptom-free controls.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of the vaginal flora in genital disease.
AB  - Samples from the posterior vaginal fornix of 102 women with various clinical conditions were analysed by a quantitative method. Aerobes were isolated from all but one of the specimens at a mean concentration of 7.2 log10 cfu/g and anaerobes from 92 specimens at a mean concentration of 8.1 log10 cfu/g. In most clinical conditions and in a control group of asymptomatic women, anaerobes outnumbered aerobes by about ten to one (one log10 unit). The most common organisms were aerobic and anaerobic lactobacilli, coryneforms, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides spp. and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. Lactobacilli did not appear to confer any protective effect by excluding the presence of other organisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis or anaerobes. The isolation of anaerobic organisms from the vagina cannot be regarded as being of pathogenic significance without other supporting evidence.
