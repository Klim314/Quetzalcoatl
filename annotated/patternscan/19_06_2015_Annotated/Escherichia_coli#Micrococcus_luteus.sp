TI  == critical roles of sea cucumber c-type lectin in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance.
AB  == c-type lectin is one important pattern recognition receptor (prr) that plays crucial roles in multiple immune responses. a c-type lectin from sea cucumber apostichopus japonicus (ajctl-1) was characterized in the present study. the amino acid sequence of ajctl-1 shared high similarities with other c-type lectins from invertebrates and vertebrates. the c-type lectin domain (ctld) of ajctl-1 contained a ca2+-binding site 2 and four conserved cysteine residues. ajctl-1 mrna expression patterns in tissues and after bacterial challenge were then analysed. quantitative pcr revealed that ajctl-1 mrna was widely expressed in the tested tissues of healthy sea cucumber. the highest expression level occurred in  gonad followed by body wall, coelomocytes, tentacle, intestinum and longitudinal  muscle, and the lowest expression level was in respiratory tree. ajctl-1 mrna expression in coelomocytes was significantly induced by gram-negative listonella  anguillarum and gram-positive micrococcus luteus, with different up-regulation patterns post-challenge. recombinant ajctl-1 exhibited the ability to bind peptidoglycan directly, agglutinate m. luteus, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, in a ca2+-dependant manner, and enhance the phagocytosis of coelomocytes against e. coli in vitro. the results indicated that ajctl-1 could act as a prr in apostichopus japonicus and had critical roles in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance against invading microbes.

TI  == a novel integrin function in innate immunity from chinese mitten crab (eriocheir  sinensis).
AB  == integrins belong to a superfamily of conserved alpha beta heterodimeric cell surface receptors that have critical function in cell migration, differentiation, and survival. in this study, an integrin called esintegrin was identified from chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis. esintegrin cdna is 4415 bp long with a 2457 bp open reading frame that encodes an 818 amino acid protein. esintegrin contains a signal peptide, an integrin beta subunit (n-terminal portion of extracellular region) inb domain, an epidermal growth factor (hegf) domain, an integrin b tail domain, a transmembrane region, and an integrin b cyt domain. esintegrin was mainly expressed in hemocytes and the heart, with a relatively lower expression level in gills, nerves, intestine, hepatopancreas, muscles, and  eyestalk. when healthy crabs were challenged with lps, pgn, staphyloccocus aureus, or vibrio parahaemolyticus, esintegrin expression level was upregulated significantly. recombinant esintegrin has agglutination activity to gram-positive (e.g., s. aureus and bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative bacteria (e.g., v. parahaemolyticus and aeromonas hydrophila) in the presence of calcium. furthermore, resintegrin could not only bind to various bacteria such as s. aureus, micrococcus luteus, b. subtilis, bacillus megaterium, bacillus thuringiensis, v. parahaemolyticus, vibrio anguillarum, a. hydrophila, vibrio natriegens, and escherichia coli, but this compound also helped crabs in clearing virulent gram-negative bacterium, v. parahaemolyticus, in vivo. these data suggested that esintegrin might function as cellular receptor that is involved in anti-bacterial immunity from e. sinensis.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  == a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.

TI  == development of an orthogonal fatty acid biosynthesis system in e. coli for oleochemical production.
AB  == here we report recombinant expression and activity of several type i fatty acid synthases that can function in parallel with the native escherichia coli fatty acid synthase. corynebacterium glutamicum fas1a was the most active in e. coli and this fatty acid synthase was leveraged to produce oleochemicals including fatty alcohols and methyl ketones. coexpression of fas1a with the acp/coa-reductase maqu2220 from marinobacter aquaeolei shifted the chain length distribution of fatty alcohols produced. coexpression of fas1a with fadm, fadb, and an acyl-coa-oxidase from micrococcus luteus resulted in the production of methyl ketones, although at a lower level than cells using the native fas. this work, to our knowledge, is the first example of in vivo function of a heterologous fatty acid synthase in e. coli. using fas1 enzymes for oleochemical  production have several potential advantages, and further optimization of this system could lead to strains with more efficient conversion to desired products.  finally, functional expression of these large enzyme complexes in e. coli will enable their study without culturing the native organisms.

TI  == functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the south china sea.
AB  == phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. in this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different  marine sponge species in the south china sea using five different culture media.  eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and  grouped into 13 genera, including actinoalloteichus, kocuria, micrococcus, micromonospora, mycobacterium, nocardiopsis, prauserella, rhodococcus, saccharopolyspora, salinispora, serinicoccus, and streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene. based on the screening of phze genes, ten strains, including five streptomyces, two nocardiopsis, one salinispora, one micrococcus, and one serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. the level of phze gene expression was highly expressed in nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on esi-ms and nmr analysis. the compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against bacillus mycoides sj14, staphylococcus aureus sj51, escherichia coli sj42, and micrococcus luteus sj47. this study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.

TI  == peroxiredoxin 1 protects the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum from oxidative stress  induced by micrococcus luteus infection.
AB  == reactive oxygen species (ross) are generated in organisms in response to infections caused by invading microbes. however, excessive ross will inflict oxidative damage on the host. peroxiredoxins (prxs) are antioxidative enzymes that may eliminate ross efficiently. in this study, apprx1 from the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum was cloned, and its function was investigated in vitro and in vivo. in the presence of dtt, recombinant apprx1 protein from escherichia coli showed antioxidative activity by eliminating h2o2 effectively. the h2o2 levels were significantly higher in micrococcus luteus-infected aphids than in uninfected aphids, and apprx1 expression was remarkably up-regulated when the aphids were infected with m. luteus or injected with h2o2. when apprx1 expression was reduced by dsrna injection, the survival of the aphids decreased significantly after m. luteus infection. knockdown of apprx1 decreased m. luteus  loads inside the aphids 48h post-infection. while under infection conditions, the h2o2 levels were much higher in apprx1 knockdown aphids than in dsgfp-injected aphids, indicating that the decreased survival of the aphids was caused by increased oxidative stress. taken together, our results reveal that apprx1 plays  a protective role in oxidative stress caused by bacterial infection.

TI  == the extract of hypericum ascyron l. induces bacterial cell death through apoptosis pathway.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: hypericum ascyron l. (h. ascyron l.) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, swelling, headache, nausea, stomach ache, abscesses, dysentery and chronic bronchitis. pharmacological studies are necessary to provide a scientific basis to substantiate their traditional use. in this study, antimicrobial effect and its mechanism of the h. ascyron l. extract was investigated. materials and methods: antimicrobial activity of the h. ascyron l. extract was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (mtt). to confirm the antimicrobial mechanism of h. ascyron l. extract on bacterial cells, annexin  v/propidium iodide (pi) double staining, tunel, and dna laddering analysis were performed. results: antibacterial effects of the h. ascyron l. extract were tested on enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumonia, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, and the results showed that the sensitive bacteria of h. ascyron l. extract mainly included e. coli, s. aureus and m. luteus, especially m. luteus. the mbc value of h. ascyron l. extract on m. luteus was equal to the mic (20mg/ml). h. ascyron l. extract could induce cells death of m. luteus through apoptosis pathway. conclusions: this study provides scientific support for some of the traditional uses and the pharmacological activities of h. ascyron l. our data provide a rational base for the folkloric use of h. ascyron l.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of selected medicinal plants from lower himalayas.
AB  == the present studies cover antibacterial activity of the crude methanolic extracts of 11 medicinal plants viz. adhatoda vasica, bauhenia variegate, bombax ceiba, carrisa opaca, caryopteris grata, debregeasia salicifolia, lantana camara, melia  azedarach, phyllanthus emblica, pinus roxburghii and olea ferruginea collected from lower himalayas against two gram positive (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus) and two gram negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aureginosa) bacterial strains. the extracts were applied at four different concentrations (120 mg/ml, 90mg/ml, 60mg/ml and 30mg/ml) in dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) by using agar well diffusion method. antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus were observed formethanolic extracts of all the above mentioned plants. greater antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa was only exhibited by phyllanthus emblica, pinus roxburghii, debregeasia salicifolia and lantana camara. escherichia coli was highly resistant to all the plant extracts at all concentrations. it is inferred  that methanolic crude extracts of the above mentioned plantsexhibitantibacterial  activities against pathogenic bacteria, which proved the ethnobotanical importance of the selected plants that indigenous people use for cure against various diseases.

TI  == serpin-15 from bombyx mori inhibits prophenoloxidase activation and expression of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == serine protease inhibitors (spis) play a key role in physiological responses by controlling protease activities. in this study, we studied the biochemical functions of serpin-15, an spi, from bombyx mori (bmserpin-15). recombinant bmserpin-15 was expressed in escherichia coli cells and used to raise rabbit anti-bmserpin-15 polyclonal antibodies. bmserpin-15 mrna and protein expression was detected in all tested tissues, particularly in the fat body and silk gland.  after challenge with four different microorganisms (escherichia coli, beauveria bassiana, micrococcus luteus and b. mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus), the expressions of bmserpin-15 mrna and protein were induced significantly, particularly by b. bassiana and m. luteus. recombinant bmserpin-15 inhibited prophenoloxidase activation, but did not affect phenoloxidase activity, in b. mori hemolymph. injection of recombinant bmserpin-15 into b. mori larvae reduced  significantly the transcript levels of antimicrobial peptides in fat body. our results suggested that bmserpin-15 plays an important role in the innate immunity of b. mori.

TI  == myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., a barotolerant actinobacterium isolated from a deep cold-water coral.
AB  == an actinobacterium strain (m-201(t)) was isolated from a deep-sea scleractinian coral (fam. caryophillidae) collected at 1500 m depth in the aviles canyon in the cantabrian sea, asturias, spain. strain m-201(t) grew at ph 6.0-9.0 (optimum ph 7.0), between 4 and 37 degrees c (optimum 28 degrees c) and at salinities of 0.5-10.5 % (w/v) nacl (optimum 0.5-3.0 %). the peptidoglycan contained the amino  acids lys, ala, thr, glu and one unknown amino acid component, and belonged to type a4alpha, and the cell-wall sugars are glucose, mannose and galactose. the polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unknown phosphoglycolipid and seven unknown glycolipids. the predominant menaquinones were mk-9(h4) and mk-9(h6). major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c15 : 0, iso-c15 : 0 and anteiso-c17 : 0. the genomic dna g+c  content was 72.4 mol%. the chemotaxonomic properties supported the affiliation of strain m-201(t) to the genus myceligenerans . phylogenetic analysis based on 16s  rrna gene sequences revealed that the organism was most closely related to myceligenerans crystallogenes cd12e2-27(t) (98.2 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity). however, it had a relatively low dna-dna relatedness value with the  above strain (48 %). the isolate showed antibiotic activity against escherichia coli , micrococcus luteus atcc 14452 and saccharomyces cerevisiae var. carlsbergensis. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of antibiotic production in the genus myceligenerans . the differences in phenotypic, metabolic, ecological and phylogenetic characteristics justify the proposal of a novel species of the genus myceligenerans , myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., with m-201(t) ( = cect 8512(t) = dsm 28392(t)) as the type  strain.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides expressed in medicinal maggots of the blow fly lucilia sericata show combinatorial activity against bacteria.
AB  == the larvae of the common green bottle fly (lucilia sericata) produce antibacterial secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. recent developments in insect biotechnology have made it possible to use  these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. here, we report the application of next-generation rna sequencing (rna-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (amps) and proteins secreted into wounds. our data confirm that l. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of amps. l. sericata amps include not only lucifensin and lucimycin but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. we identified 47 genes encoding putative amps and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, and enterococcus faecalis. against escherichia coli (gram negative) and micrococcus luteus (gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected amps were tested in combination. the amps that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages.

TI  == enzyme fusion for whole-cell biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters.
AB  == enzyme fusion was investigated as a strategy to improve productivity of a two-step whole-cell biocatalysis. the biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters by an alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) and baeyer-villiger monooxygenases (bvmos) was used as the model reaction. the recombinant escherichia coli, expressing the fusion enzymes between the adh of micrococcus luteus nctc2665 and the bvmo of pseudomonas putida kt2440 or rhodococcus jostii rha1, showed significantly greater bioconversion activity with long-chain sec-alcohols (e.g., 12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (1a), 13-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (2a), 14-hydroxyicos-11-enoic acid (4a)) when compared to the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh and bvmos independently. for instance, activity of the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh-gly-bvmo, in which glycine-rich peptide was used as the linker, with 1a was increased up to 22 mumol g dry cells-1 min-1. this value is over 40 % greater than the recombinant e. coli expressing the adh and bvmo independently. the substantial improvement appeared to be driven by an increase in the functional expression of the bvmos and/or an increase in mass transport efficiency by localizing two active sites in close proximity.

AB  == six new prenylated benzophenones, (-)-nemorosonol (1) and trijapins a-e (2-6), were isolated from the aerial parts of triadenum japonicum. (-)-nemorosonol (1) and trijapins a-c (2-4) have a common tricyclo[4.3.1.0(3,7)]decane skeleton, while 1 is an enantiomer of (+)-nemorosonol previously isolated from clusia nemorosa. the absolute configuration of (-)-nemorosonol (1) was assigned by ecd spectroscopy. trijapins a-c (2-4) are analogues of 1 possessing an additional tetrahydrofuran ring. trijapins d (5) and e (6) are prenylated benzophenones with a 1,2-dioxane moiety and a hydroperoxy group, respectively. (-)-nemorosonol (1) exhibited antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli (mic, 8 mug/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic, 16 mug/ml), bacillus subtilis (mic, 16 mug/ml), micrococcus luteus (mic, 32 mug/ml), aspergillus niger (ic50, 16 mug/ml), trichophyton mentagrophytes (ic50, 8 mug/ml), and candida albicans (ic50, 32 mug/ml), while trijapin d (5) showed antimicrobial activity against c. albicans (ic50, 8 mug/ml).

TI  == functional implications of the peptidoglycan recognition proteins in the immunity of the yellow fever mosquito, aedes aegypti.
AB  == peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps) play essential roles in the immune systems of insects and higher animals against certain pathogens, including bacteria. in insects, most studies on the functions of pgrps have been performed  in drosophila, with only limited studies in mosquitoes, which are important disease vectors. in the present study, we analysed the pgrp sequences of the yellow fever mosquito, aedes aegypti, acquired from two genome databases, and identified a total of seven pgrp genes; namely, pgrp-s1, -sc2, -la, -lb, -lc, -ld and -le. bacterial injection using the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and the gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus showed that three pgrps responded directly to both bacterial stimuli. subsequently, the transcriptional expression of six of these pgrps was knocked down using double-stranded rna-injection-based rna interference (rnai). rnai of the pgrps resulted in different impacts on the immune responses of ae. aegypti to the two bacteria, as  evidenced by the changes in mosquito survival rates after bacterial challenges as well as the differential regulation of several antimicrobial peptides and a number of other genes involved in mosquito immune pathways. our data suggest that pgrp-lc is a significant factor in mediating immune responses to both e. coli and m. luteus, and the other pgrps play only minor roles against these two bacteria,  with pgrp-sc2 and -lb also serving as potential negative regulators for certain immune pathway(s) in ae. aegypti.

TI  == different forms of apolipophorin iii in galleria mellonella larvae challenged with bacteria and fungi.
AB  == apolipophorin iii (apolp-iii), a lipid-binding protein and an insect homolog of human apolipoprotein e, plays an important role in lipid transport and immune response in insects. in the present study, we have demonstrated a correlation in  time between changes in the apolp-iii abundance occurring in the hemolymph, hemocytes, and fat body after immunization of galleria mellonella larvae with gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus, yeast candida albicans, and a filamentous fungus fusarium oxysporum. using two-dimensional electrophoresis (ief/sds-page) and immunoblotting with anti-apolp-iii antibodies, the profile of apolp-iii forms in g. mellonella larvae challenged with the bacteria and fungi has been analyzed. besides the major apolp-iii protein (pi=6.5), one and three additional apolp-iii forms differing in the pi value have been detected, respectively, in the hemolymph, hemocytes, and fat body of non-immunized insects. also, evidence has been provided that particular apolp-iii-derived polypeptides appear after the immune challenge and are present mainly in the hemolymph and hemocytes. the time of their appearance and persistence in the hemolymph was dependent on the pathogen used. at least two of the apolp-iii forms detected in hemolymph bound to the microbial cell surface. the increasing number of hemolymph apolp-iii polypeptides and differences in their profiles observed in time after the challenge with different immunogens confirmed the important role of apolp-iii in discriminating between pathogens by  the insect defense system and in antibacterial as well as antifungal immune response.

TI  == expression levels of chaperones influence biotransformation activity of recombinant escherichia coli expressing micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase  and pseudomonas putida baeyer-villiger monooxygenase.
AB  == we demonstrated for the first time that the archaeal chaperones (i.e., gamma-prefoldin and thermosome) can stabilize enzyme activity in vivo. ricinoleic acid biotransformation activity of recombinant escherichia coli expressing micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase and the pseudomonas putida kt2440 baeyer-villiger monooxygenase improved significantly with co-expression of gamma-prefoldin or recombinant themosome originating from the deep-sea hyperthermophile archaea methanocaldococcus jannaschii. furthermore, the degree of enhanced activity was dependent on the expression levels of the chaperones. for example, whole-cell biotransformation activity was highest at 12 micromol/g dry cells/min when gamma-prefoldin expression level was approximately 46% of the  theoretical maximum. this value was approximately two-fold greater than that in e. coli, where the gamma-prefoldin expression level was zero or set to the theoretical maximum. therefore, it was assumed that the expression levels of chaperones must be optimized to achieve maximum biotransformation activity in whole-cell biocatalysts.

TI  == improved antimicrobial activities of synthetic-hybrid bacteriocins designed from  enterocin e50-52 and pediocin pa-1.
AB  == two hybrid bacteriocins, enterocin e50-52/pediocin pa-1 (ep) and pediocin pa-1/enterocin e50-52 (pe), were designed by combining the n terminus of enterocin e50-52 and the c terminus of pediocin pa-1 and by combining the c terminus of pediocin pa-1 and the n terminus of enterocin e50-52, respectively. both hybrid bacteriocins showed reduced mics compared to those of their natural counterparts. the mics of hybrid pe and ep were 64- and 32-fold lower, respectively, than the mic of pediocin pa-1 and 8- and 4-fold lower, respectively, than the mic of enterocin e50-52. in this study, the effect of hybrid as well as wild-type (wt) bacteriocins on the transmembrane electrical potential (deltapsi) and their ability to induce the efflux of intracellular atp  were investigated. enterocin e50-52, pediocin pa-1, and hybrid bacteriocin pe were able to dissipate deltapsi, but ep was unable to deplete this component. both hybrid bacteriocins caused a loss of the intracellular concentration of atp. ep, however, caused a faster efflux than pe and enterocin e50-52. enterocin e50-52 and hybrids pe and ep were active against the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria tested, such as micrococcus luteus, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 20e1090, and escherichia coli o157:h7. the hybrid bacteriocins designed and described herein are antimicrobial peptides with mics lower those of their natural counterparts. both hybrid peptides induce the loss of intracellular atp and are capable of inhibiting gram-negative bacteria, and pe dissipates the electrical potential. in this study, the mic of hybrid bacteriocin pe decreased 64-fold compared to the mic of its natural peptide counterpart, pediocin pa-1. inhibition of gram-negative pathogens confers an additional advantage for the application of these peptides in therapeutics.

TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == involvement of a serpin serine protease inhibitor (ooserpin) from mollusc octopus ocellatus in antibacterial response.
AB  == serpin is an important member of serine protease inhibitors (spis), which is capable of regulating proteolytic events and involving in a variety of physiological processes. in present study, a serpin homolog was identified from octopus ocellatus (designated as ooserpin). full-length cdna of ooserpin was of 1735 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region of 214 bp, a 3' utr of 282 bp, and an open reading frame of 1239 bp. the open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 412 amino acids which has a predicted molecular weight of 46.5 kda and an isoelectric point of 8.52. the ooserpin protein shares 37% sequence identity with other serpins from mus musculus (np_941373) and ixodes scapularis (xp_002407493). the existence of a conserved serpin domain strongly suggested that ooserpin was a member of the serpin subfamily. expression patterns of ooserpin, both in tissues  and towards bacterial stimulation, were then characterized. the mrna of ooserpin  was constitutively expressed at different levels in all tested tissues of untreated o. ocellatus, including mantle (lowest), muscle, renal sac, gill, hemocyte, gonad, systemic heart, and hepatopancreas (highest). the transcriptional level of ooserpin was significantly up-regulated (p<0.01) in o. ocellatus upon bacterial challenges with vibrio anguillarum and micrococcus luteus, indicating its involvement in the antibacterial immune response. furthermore, rooserpin, the recombinant protein of ooserpin, exhibited strong abilities to inhibit proteinase activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin as well as the growth of escherichia coli. our results demonstrate that ooserpin is a potential antibacterial factor involved in the immune response of o. ocellatus against bacterial infection.

TI  == molecular identification of two prophenoloxidase-activating proteases from the hemocytes of plutella xylostella (lepidoptera: plutellidae) and their transcript  abundance changes in response to microbial challenges.
AB  == the phenoloxidase (po) activation system plays an important role in insect innate immunity, particularly in wound healing and pathogen defense. a key member of this system is prophenoloxidase-activating protease (pap), which is the direct activator of prophenoloxidase (propo). despite their importance in the insect po  activation system, content of studies is limited. in this article, we identify two complementary dnas (cdnas), pxpapa and pxpapb, encoding possible paps, from immunized larval hemocytes of the diamondback moth, plutella xylostella (l.), by  race method. pxpapa is 1,149-bp long and encodes a 382-residue open reading frame (orf) with a predicted 17-residue signal peptide, a clip domain, and a tryp_spc domain. pxpapb is 1,650-bp long and encodes a 440-residue orf with a predicted 20-residue signal peptide, two clip domains, and a tryp_spc domain. pxpapa and pxpapb have a high sequence similarity to manduca sexta (l.) pap1 and pap3, respectively. we also examined the transcript patterns of pxpapa, pxpapb, and pxpap3, another clip-domain serine protease gene, response to different microbial challenges by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. the results show that the transcript abundance of pxpapa is significantly increased by micrococcus luteus and escherichia coli but not candida albicans. pxpapb is induced only by mi. luteus, whereas pxpap3 could be induced by all the microbes in the test, but the transcript patterns of mi. luteus, e. coli, and c. albicans  are completely different. this study provides new insights into the molecular events that occur during the immune response, particularly melanization cascade that is involved in encapsulation and nodulation of pathogen or parasite invaders via hemocytes in host insects.

TI  == fabrication of swcnt-ag nanoparticle hybrid included self-assemblies for antibacterial applications.
AB  == the present article reports the development of soft nanohybrids comprising of single walled carbon nanotube (swcnt) included silver nanoparticles (agnps) having superior antibacterial property. in this regard aqueous dispersing agent of carbon nanotube (cnt) containing a silver ion reducing unit was synthesised by the inclusion of tryptophan and tyrosine within the backbone of the amphiphile. the dispersions were characterized spectroscopically and microscopically using tem, afm and raman spectroscopy. the nanotube-nanoparticle conjugates were prepared by the in situ photoreduction of agno3. the phenolate residue and the indole moieties of tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively reduces the sliver ion as well as acts as stabilizing agents for the synthesized agnps. the nanohybrids  were characterized using tem and afm. the antibacterial activity of the nanohybrids was studied against gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and micrococcus  luteus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and klebsiella aerogenes). the swcnt dispersions showed moderate killing ability (40-60%) against gram-positive bacteria however no antibacterial activity was observed against the gram negative ones. interestingly, the developed swcnt-amphiphile-agnp nanohybrids exhibited significant killing ability ( approximately 90%) against all bacteria. importantly, the cell viability of these newly developed self-assemblies was checked towards chinese hamster ovarian cells and high cell viability was observed after 24 h of incubation. this specific killing of bacterial cells may have been achieved due to the presence of higher -sh containing proteins in the cell walls of the bacteria. the developed nanohybrids  were subsequently infused into tissue engineering scaffold agar-gelatin films and the films similarly showed bactericidal activity towards both kinds of bacterial  strains while allowing normal growth of eukaryotic cells on the surface of the films.

TI  == antibacterial potential of calotropis procera (flower) extract against various pathogens.
AB  == increased bacterial resistance towards commonly used antibiotics has become a debated issue all over the world in a last few decades. due to this, consumer demand towards natural anti-microbial agents is increasing day by day. natural anti-microbial agents have gained enormous attention as an alternative therapeutic agent in pharmaceutical industry. current study is an effort to explore and identify a bactericidal potential of various solvent extracts of calotropis procera flower. flowers of c. procera were extracted with hexane, butanol, ethyl acetate and aqua to evaluate the antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion method against the various human pathogens. the microorganisms used in this study includes salmonella typhi, escherichia coli (o157:h7), micrococcus luteus kibge-ib20 (gen bank accession: jq250612) and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) kibge-ib23 (gen bank accession: kc465400). zones of inhibition were observed against all four pathogenic strains. fraction soluble in hexane showed broad spectrum of inhibition against all the studied pathogens. however, fractions soluble in ethyl acetate inhibited the growth of e. coli, mrsa, and m. luteus. in case of butanol and aqueous extracts only growth of m. luteus was inhibited. results revealed that the flower extracts of c. procera  have a potential to be used as an antibacterial agent against these pathogenic organisms.

TI  == antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles synthesized using pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as a green bioreductant.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of nanoparticles (nps) can be significantly enhanced by increasing the wettability or solubility of nps in aqueous medium. in this study, we investigated the effects of the stabilizing agent on the solubility of  silver nps and its subsequent effect on their antimicrobial activities. silver nps were prepared using an aqueous solution of pulicaria glutinosa plant extract  as bioreductant. the solution also acts as a capping ligand. during this study, the antimicrobial activities of silver nps, as well as the plant extract alone, were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and micrococcus luteus. silver nps were prepared with various concentrations of the plant extract to study its effect on antimicrobial activity. interestingly, various concentrations of p. glutinosa extract did not show any effect on the growth of tested bacteria; however, a significant effect on the antimicrobial property of plant extract capped silver nps (ag-nps-pe) was  observed. for instance, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values were found to decrease (from 4% to 21%) with the increasing concentrations of plant extract used for the synthesis of ag-nps-pe. these results clearly indicate that  the addition of p. glutinosa extracts enhances the solubility of ag-nps-pe and, hence, increases their toxicity against the tested microorganisms.

TI  == inducible factors with antimicrobial activity after immune challenge in the haemolymph of red palm weevil (insecta).
AB  == insects are capable of innate immune responses elicited after microbial infection. in this process, the receptor-mediated recognition of foreign bodies and the subsequent activation of immunocompetent cells lead to the synthesis ex novo of a peptide pool with antimicrobial activity. we investigated the inducible immune response of a coleopteran, rhynchophorus ferrugineus, challenged with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. after immunization, we evaluated the presence of antimicrobial peptides using either biochemical analyses or microbiological techniques. the antimicrobial properties of the newly synthesized protein pool, detectable in haemolymph fractions of low molecular mass, showed strong antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. ox1, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus). in addition to the preliminary study of the mechanism of action of the pool of antimicrobial  peptides, we also investigated its effects on bacterial cell walls by means of fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. the data suggest that the main effects seem to be directed at destabilizing and damaging the bacterial  wall. this study provides data that help us to understand some aspects of the inducible innate immunity in a system model that lacks anticipatory responses. however, the weevil has finely tuned its defensive strategies to counteract effectively microbial infection.

TI  == nitric oxide levels regulate the immune response of drosophila melanogaster reference laboratory strains to bacterial infections.
AB  == studies on the innate immune response against microbial infections in drosophila  melanogaster involve mutant strains and their reference strains that act as experimental controls. we used five standard d. melanogaster laboratory reference strains (oregon r, w1118, canton-s, cinnabar brown, and yellow white [yw]) and investigated their response against two pathogenic bacteria (photorhabdus luminescens and enterococcus faecalis) and two nonpathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus). we detected high sensitivity among yw  flies to bacterial infections and increased bacterial growth compared to the other strains. we also found variation in the transcription of certain antimicrobial peptide genes among strains, with oregon and yw infected flies showing the highest and lowest gene transcription levels in most cases. we show that oregon and w1118 flies possess more circulating hemocytes and higher levels  of phenoloxidase activity than the other strains upon infection with the nonpathogenic bacteria. we further observed reduced fat accumulation in yw flies  infected with the pathogenic bacteria, which suggests a possible decline in physiological condition. finally, we found that nitrite levels are significantly  lower in infected and uninfected yw flies compared to w1118 flies and that nitric oxide synthase mutant flies in yw background are more susceptible to bacterial infection compared to mutants in w1118 background. therefore, increased sensitivity of yw flies to bacterial infections can be partly attributed to lower levels of nitric oxide. such studies will significantly contribute toward a better understanding of the genetic variation between d. melanogaster reference strains.

TI  == lysozyme and defense peptides as suppressors of phenoloxidase activity in galleria mellonella.
AB  == the prophenoloxidase (propo) cascade supplies quinones and other reactive compounds for melanin formation, protein cross-linking, hemolymph coagulation, and killing of microbial invaders as well as parasites. the high cytotoxicity of  the generated compounds requires a strict control of the activation of the propo  system and phenoloxidase (po) activity to minimize damage to host tissues and cells. the po activity in hemolymph of escherichia coli challenged galleria mellonella larvae increased, with a temporal drop 1 h after the challenge, reaching the highest level 24 h after the challenge. in the present study, a potential role of g. mellonella defense peptides and lysozyme in controlling the  propo system was investigated. the effects of purified defense peptides (anionic  peptides 1 and 2, cecropin d-like peptide, galleria defensin, proline-rich peptides 1 and 2) and lysozyme were analyzed. four compounds, namely lysozyme, galleria defensin, proline-rich peptide 1, and anionic peptide 2, decreased the hemolymph po activity considerably, whereas the others did not affect the enzyme  activity level. our results indicate that these hemolymph factors could play multiple and distinct roles in the insect immune response.

TI  == type i and type ii crustins from penaeus monodon, genetic variation and antimicrobial activity of the most abundant crustinpm4.
AB  == an antimicrobial protein, crustin, is involved in the innate immunity of crustacean by defending the host directly against the microbial pathogens. by data mining the penaeus monodon est database, two type i crustins, carcininpm1 and 2, and ten type ii crustins, crustinpm1-10, were identified. the abundant crustins were crustinpm1, 4 and 7, each with variation in the length of gly-rich  repeat among its members. a few crustinpm1, 4 and 7 with deletion in the cys-rich region were also observed. furthermore, the crustinpm4 with the longest n-terminal gly-rich region was characterized. the crustinpm4 allelic genes were expressed mainly from the hemocytes. its expression was up-regulated readily by wssv infection and gradually decreased to normal level afterwards. the recombinant crustinpm4-1 (rcrustinpm4-1) isoform was produced using the escherichia coli expression system and tested for its antimicrobial activity. the rcrustinpm4-1 was able to inhibit the growth of a gram-positive bacterium, bacillus megaterium but not bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus. it also inhibited the growth of two gram-negative bacteria, e. coli 363 and vibrio harveyi 639 at lower potency. the rcrustinpm4-1  affected the wssv infection because the expression of an intermediate early gene  ie1 in wssv-infected hemocyte cell culture was reduced. it was shown further that the rcrustinpm4-1 could delay by about one and a half days the manifestation of disease by wssv.

TI  == functions of armigeres subalbatus c-type lectins in innate immunity.
AB  == c-type lectins (ctls) are a superfamily of calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding proteins containing at least one carbohydrate-recognition domain (crd) and they are present in almost all metazoans. insect ctls may function as pattern-recognition receptors and play important roles in innate immunity. in this study, we selected five asctls from the mosquito armigeres subalbatus, a natural vector of filarial nematodes, and performed both in vitro and in vivo studies to elucidate their functions in innate immunity. asctlma15, asctlga5 and  asctl15 were mainly expressed in hemocytes, asctl16 was expressed in fat body, while asctlma11 was expressed in both hemocytes and fat body, and only asctlma11  and asctl16 were expressed at high levels in adult females. in vitro binding assays showed that all five recombinant asctls could bind to different microbial  cell wall components, including lipopolysaccharide (lps), lipid a, peptidoglycan  (pg), lipoteichoic acid (lta), zymosan and laminarin (beta-1,3-glucan). recombinant asctls also bound to several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and could agglutinate bacterial cells. injection of double-stranded rnas (dsrnas) could significantly reduce expression of the five asctl mrnas, and  the survival of mosquitoes treated with dsrna to asctlga5 was significantly decreased after escherichia coli infection, but did not change significantly after micrococcus luteus infection compared to the control groups, suggesting that ar. subalbatus asctlga5 may participate in innate immunity against e. coli.

TI  == irfc - an ixodes ricinus injury-responsive molecule related to limulus factor c.
AB  == limulus clotting factor c is a multi-domain serine protease that triggers horseshoe crab hemolymph clotting in the presence of trace amounts of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. here we describe and functionally characterize an homologous molecule, designated as irfc, from the hard tick ixodes ricinus. tick factor c consists of an n-terminal cysteine-rich domain, four complement control protein (sushi) modules, an lccl domain, a truncated c-lectin domain and a c-terminal trypsin-type domain. developmental expression profiling by quantitative real-time pcr revealed that the irfc mrna is expressed in all stages including eggs. in tissues dissected from adult i. ricinus females, the irfc mrna is present mainly  in tick hemocytes and accordingly, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy localized irfc intracellularly, in tick hemocytes. irfc mrna levels were markedly increased upon injection of sterile saline, or different microbes, demonstrating  that the irfc gene transcription occurs in response to injury. this indicates a possible role of irfc in hemolymph clotting and/or wound healing, although these  defense mechanisms have not been yet definitely demonstrated in ticks. rnai silencing of irfc expression resulted in a significant reduction in phagocytic activity of tick hemocytes against the gram-negative bacteria chryseobacterium indologenes and escherichia coli, but not against the yeast, candida albicans. this result suggests that irfc plays a role in the tick primordial complement system and as such possibly mediates transmission of tick-borne pathogens.

AB  == a protein transiently expressed in the neural precursors of developing tissues (tenp) was found to be present in emu (dromaius novaehollandiae) egg white as one of the major proteins. nucleotide analysis of its encoding cdna revealed a sequence of 452 amino acids including a 19 amino acid peptide signal. phylogenetic analysis determined that emu tenp was clustered within the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) superfamily together with other avian tenps. rt-pcr analysis revealed that the emu tenp gene was highly expressed in the magnum of the oviduct, indicating that tenp is a major egg white component. emu tenp was purified by anion exchange chromatography and ammonium sulfate fractionation. unlike bpi, emu tenp exhibited antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis, but not against gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the results suggest that emu tenp is a potent novel antibacterial protein with a spectrum distinct from that of bpi.

TI  == ecdysone mediates the development of immunity in the drosophila embryo.
AB  == beyond their role in cell metabolism, development, and reproduction, hormones are also important modulators of the immune system. in the context of inflammatory disorders, systemic administration of pharmacological doses of synthetic glucocorticoids (gcs) is widely used as an anti-inflammatory treatment [1, 2]. however, not all actions of gcs are immunosuppressive, and many studies have suggested that physiological concentrations of gcs can have immunoenhancing effects [3-7]. for a more comprehensive understanding of how steroid hormones regulate immunity and inflammation, a simple in vivo system is required. the drosophila embryo has recently emerged as a powerful model system to study the recruitment of immune cells to sterile wounds [8] and host-pathogen dynamics [9]. here we investigate the immune response of the fly embryo to bacterial infections and find that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-he) can regulate the quality of the immune response and influence the resolution of infection in drosophila embryos.

TI  == immunohistochemical analysis of the role of hemocytin in nodule formation in the  larvae of the silkworm, bombyx mori.
AB  == hemocytin, a multidomain protein from bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae), is an ortholog of von willebrand factor and is expected to be a major mediator of hemocyte aggregation. antiserum was generated against hemocytin, and immune staining of hemocytes, hemolymph, and nodules was performed. hemocytin was observed in steady-state hemocytes but not in plasma, even after bacterial injection. when hemolymph was smeared on glass slides, hemocytin-containing fibrous structures formed a cellular network mainly consisting of granulocytes and oenocytoids. hemocytin was stained only in the granules of the granulocytes.  when nodule-like aggregates formed 30 sec after bacterial injection, both granulocytes and bacterial cells were observed binding to hemocytin-containing fibrous structures. when nodule sections were stained with antiserum, hemocytin was seen in the matrix of the nodules surrounding the hemocytes. these data suggest that hemocytin plays a major role in nodule formation as a component of the sticky fibrous structure exocytosed from granulocytes.

AB  == several (+)- and (-)-alpha-pinene derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for  their antimicrobial activity toward gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli, and the unicellular fungus candida albicans using bioautographic assays. (+)-alpha-pinene 1a showed modest activity against the test organisms, whereas (-)-alpha-pinene 1b showed no activity at the tested concentration. of all the alpha-pinene derivatives evaluated, the beta-lactam derivatives (10a and 10b) were the most antimicrobial. the increase in the antimicrobial activity of 10a compared to 1a ranged from nearly 3.5-fold (c. albicans) to 43-fold (s. aureus). the mean +/- standard deviation for the zone of inhibition (mm) for 10a (c. albicans) was 31.9 +/- 4.3 and that for s. aureus was 51.1 +/- 2.9. although (-)-alpha-pinene 1b was not active toward the test microorganisms, the corresponding beta-lactam 10b, amino ester 13b, and amino alcohol 14b showed antimicrobial activity toward the test microorganisms. the increase in the antimicrobial activity of 10b compared to 1b ranged from 32-fold (s. aureus) to 73-fold (m. luteus). the mean +/- standard deviation for the zone of inhibition (mm) for 10b (s. aureus) was 32.0 +/- 0.60 and that for m. luteus was 73.2 +/- 0.30.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of trp-containing analogs of the antimicrobial peptide gomesin.
AB  == gomesin (gm) has a broad antimicrobial activity making it of great interest for development of drugs. in this study, we analyzed three gm analogs, [trp(1) ]-gm,  [trp(7) ]-gm, and [trp(9) ]-gm, in an attempt to gain insight into the contributions of different regions of the peptide sequence to its activity. the incorporation of the tryptophan residue in different positions has no effect on the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the gm analogs in relation to gm. spectroscopic studies (circular dichroism, fluorescence and absorbance) of gm and its analogs were performed in the presence of sds, below and above its critical micelle concentration (cmc) (~8 mm), in order to monitor structural changes induced by the interaction with this anionic surfactant (0-15 mm). interestingly, we found that the analogs interact more strongly with sds at low concentrations (0.3-6.0 mm) than close to or above its cmc. this suggests that sds monomers are  able to cover the whole peptide, forming large detergent-peptide aggregates. on the other hand, the peptides interact differently with sds micelles, inserting partially into the micelle core. among the peptides, trp in position 1 becomes more motionally-restricted in the presence of sds, probably because this residue  is located at the n-terminal region, which presents higher conformational freedom to interact stronger with sds molecules. trp residues in positions 7 and 9, close to and in the region of the turn of the molecule, respectively, induced a more constrained structure and the compounds cannot insert deeper into the micelle core or be completely buried by sds monomers.

TI  == amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
AB  == we introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. the design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (sar) study are reported. specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (irras) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. furthermore, langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane  selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive m. luteus and s. aureus as well as against gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. we found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. overall, this study provides further insights into the sar of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.

TI  == modification of a synthetic lps-binding domain of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor  from shrimp reveals strong structure-activity relationship in their antimicrobial characteristics.
AB  == anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (alf) is a small protein with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and certain antiviral property. its putative lipopolysaccharide (lps) binding domain was deduced to be important for its activities. however, there is still no report revealing how the structure of the  lps-binding domain affects its biological function until now. in the present study, we designed and synthesized a peptide corresponding to the lps-binding domain of alf from the chinese shrimp (designated as fcalf-lbdc) and its structure-modified isoforms in order to analyze the relationship between its structure and antimicrobial activities. results showed that fcalf-lbdc exhibited  apparent antibacterial activities against both gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and vibrio anguillarum and gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and micrococcus lysodeikticus with mic ranges of 32-64, 2-4, 1-2, and 32-64mum, respectively. the disulfide loop and the basic amino acids in the lps-binding domain (lbd) of alf played key roles in its antibacterial activities. in addition, fcalf-lbdc could reduce the propagation of white spot syndrome virus (wssv) in vivo, and its lysine residue is indispensable for its antiviral property. this is the first attempt to testify the effects of the sequence features of the lps-binding domain on its antimicrobial activities.

TI  == facile method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using 3-hydrazino-isatin  derivatives in aqueous methanol and their antibacterial activity.
AB  == introduction: a new method for preparation of silver nanoparticles (agnps) based  on using hydrazino-isatin derivatives in an aqueous methanol reaction medium is reported here. agnps were prepared using silver nitrate solubilized in a water core as the source of silver ions and 3-hydrazino-isatin derivatives (3-hydrazino-isatin [ish] and 1-benzyl-3-hydrazino-isatin [bish]) solubilized in  methanol core as a reducing agent. the proposed method is effective, rapid, and convenient. x-ray diffraction (xrd), energy dispersive x-ray analysis, scanning electron microscope (sem) and transmission electron microscopy (tem) were used for characterization of the agnps. the tem micrographs confirmed that the nanopowders consist of well-dispersed agglomerates of grains with a narrow size distribution of 18-21 nm and 17-20 nm. the agnps, as well as bish, showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity against the gram-positive bacillus subtilis and gram-negative micrococcus luteus and proteus vulgaris, as well as antifungal activities against saccharomyces cerevisiae. on the other hand, they were not effective against the gram-negative escherichia coli. purpose: a simple, effective, rapid, and convenient chemical reduction method for the synthesis of agnps in an aqueous methanol reaction medium using hydrazino-isatin derivatives and studying their antibacterial effect. results: ish and bish are remarkably powerful reductants for ag+ ions in an aqueous methanol medium, which could be considered as a simple chemical reduction method for formation of agnps. the agnp formation depends on the solubility of the hydrazino-isatin derivatives. bish gave more agnps than ish, as observed from xrd. the formation of agnps is attributed to the adsorption of hydrazine derivatives and/or interparticle interaction on the surface of agnp through electrostatic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the hydrazino group (c=n-nh2) and the positive surface of  agnps. agnps and bish showed high antimicrobial and bacterial activity. conclusion: in summary, it is shown that ish and bish are remarkably powerful reductants for ag+ ions in an aqueous methanol medium. bish gave more agnps than  ish, as observed from xrd due to better solubility of the bish than ish in aqueous-methanol. the formation of agnps is attributed to the adsorption of hydrazine derivatives and/or interparticle interaction on the surface of agnps through electrostatic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the hydrazino group (c=n-nh2) and the positive surface of agnps. the agnps as well as bish ligand showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity.

TI  == structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee macropis fulvipes (hymenoptera: melittidae).
AB  == a novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (mac-1) with sequence gly-phe-gly-met-ala-leu-lys-leu-leu-lys-lys-val-leu-nh2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee macropis fulvipes. mac-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. a series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. the antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against  human red blood cells was decreased. the activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the n-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin.  data obtained by cd spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an  amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. in addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions  in mac-1 using nmr spectroscopy.

AB  == nodules consisting of hemocytes and trapped microorganisms are important targets  for melanization, which is best known in the insect immune system. we investigated factors functioning in nodule melanization and the mechanism by which these factors congregate in the nodule. bmhp21, bmsph1 and bmsph2, bombyx mori orthologs of manduca sexta serine protease hp21, serine protease homologs (sph1 and sph2), and a prophenoloxidase, bmpo1 were observed as inactive forms in the plasma, but as putatively active forms in the nodule. production of prophenoloxidase-activating proteinases, bmpap1 and bmpap3/ppae and bmpo1 were confirmed in hemocytes. bmsph1 and bmsph2 were observed on trapped bacterial cells in the nodule and were isolated from the surface of bacterial cells incubated with plasma. bmsph1 and bmsph2 were found in plasma in complex with a pattern recognition receptor, bmlbp. these data suggest that melanization-regulating factors congregate in nodules through a combination of microorganism-dependent and hemocyte-dependent routes.

TI  == protective role of the neuropeptide urocortin ii against experimental sepsis and  leishmaniasis by direct killing of pathogens.
AB  == we currently face an alarming resurgence in infectious diseases characterized by  antimicrobial resistance and therapeutic failure. this has generated the urgent need of developing new therapeutic approaches that include agents with nontraditional modes of action. a recent interest focused on approaches based on  our natural immune defenses, especially on peptides that combine innate antimicrobial activity against diverse pathogens and immunoregulatory functions.  in this study, to our knowledge, we describe for the first time the antimicrobial activity of the neuropeptide urocortin ii (ucnii) against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and tropical parasites of the genus leishmania. importantly, this cytotoxicity was selective for pathogens, because ucnii did not affect mammalian cell viability. structurally, ucnii has a cationic and amphipathic design that resembles antimicrobial peptides. using mutants and ucnii fragments, we determined the structural requirements for the interaction between the peptide and the surface of pathogen. following its binding to pathogen, ucnii caused cell death through different membrane-disrupting mechanisms that involve aggregation and membrane depolarization in bacteria and pore formation in leishmania. noteworthily, ucnii killed the infective form of leishmania major even inside the infected macrophages. consequently, ucnii prevented mortality caused by polymicrobial sepsis and ameliorated pathological signs of cutaneous leishmaniasis. besides its presence in body physical and mucosal barriers, we found that innate immune cells produce ucnii in response to  infections. therefore, ucnii could be considered as an ancient highly-conserved host peptide involved in the natural antimicrobial defense and emerge as an attractive alternative to current treatments for microbial disorders with associated drug resistances.

AB  == antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cements (alabc) spacers are routinely used in the  treatment of prosthetic joint infections. the objectives of our study were to evaluate different alabc for elution kinetics, thermal stability, and mechanical  properties. a 10 or 20% mixture (w/w) beads of medium viscosity bone cement (depuy, inc) and vancomycin (van), gentamycin (gm), daptomycin (dap), moxifloxacin (mox), rifampicin (rif), cefotaxime (ctx), cefepime (fep), amoxicillin clavulanate (amc), ampicillin (amp), meropenem (mer), and ertapenem (ert) were formed and placed into wells filled with phosphate-buffered saline. antibiotic concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. antimicrobial activity was tested against micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 or escherichia coli atcc 25922. amc, amp, and fep concentration rapidly decreased after day 2, being almost undetectable at day 4. sustained and high elution rates were observed with van, gm, mox, and rif for the 30-day duration of the experiment. dap, mer, ert, and ctx elution rates constantly decreased from day 4. all antibiotics tested retained antimicrobial activity proving thermal stability. mechanical properties of alabc were maintained except when rif was used.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of antihypertensive food-derived peptides and selected alanine analogues.
AB  == this study evaluated four food-derived peptides with known antihypertensive activities for antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms, and assessed structure-function relationships using alanine analogues. the peptides (evslnsgyy, barley; pgtavfk, soybean; ttmplw, alpha-casein; vhlpp, alpha-zein) and the six alanine substitution peptides of pgtavfk were synthesised, characterised and evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the bacteria, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and micrococcus luteus and the yeast, candida albicans. the peptides ttmplw and pgtavfk inhibited growth of all four microorganisms tested, with activities of a similar order of magnitude to ampicillin and ethanol controls. evslnsgyy inhibited the growth of the bacteria,  but vhlpp showed no antimicrobial activity. the alanine analogue, pgaavfk showed  the highest overall antimicrobial activity and pgtavfa showed no activity; overall, the activities of the analogues were consistent with their structures. some peptides with antihypertensive activity also show antimicrobial activity, suggesting that food-derived peptides may exert beneficial effects via a number of mechanisms.

TI  == identification and expression profile analysis of antimicrobial peptide/protein in asian corn borer, ostrinia furnacalis (guenee).
AB  == antimicrobial peptides/proteins (amps) are a group of immune proteins that exhibit strong antibiotic properties against numerous infectious bacterial strains. they are evolutionarily conserved and present in every kingdom and phylum, ranging from prokaryotes to humans. we analyzed the transciptome from the larvae of asian corn borer, ostrinia furnacalis (guenee), and identified several  putative amp transcripts, ofglys5, ofglys6, ofglys10, ofgatt, and ofgiid. ofglys5, ofglys6, and ofglys10 are all highly homologous with c-type lysozymes, and ofgatt shows significant identities with lepidoptera attacin. the amino acid  sequence of ofglys5 and ofglys6 possessed all conserved features critical for fundamental structure and function of c-type lysozyme, including the two catalytic sites, glu(32) and asp(50). ofgatt is a typical glycine-rich protein. the antimicrobial activity of o. furnacalis hemolymph increased significantly after injection with escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, or beauveria bassiana. ofgatt, idd, and lys6 are expressed at low level prior to the challenge, but strongly induced against gram-positive and negative bacteria, and fungi. under the same inducement conditions, the transcripts of these three genes elevated most when fifth instar larvae were injected. therefore, o. furnacalis larvae are  induced to produce antimicrobial materials in the hemolymph after the infection,  and increase of lysozyme and attacin may contribute to the antimicrobial activity.

AB  == extracts from five indigenous palestinian medicinal plants including rosmarinus officinalis, pisidium guajava, punica granatum peel, grape seeds and teucrium polium were investigated for antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities against eight microorganisms, using well diffusion method. the microorganisms included six bacterial isolates (i.e. staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginos, klebsiella pneumonia, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and two fungal isolates (i.e. candida albicans and aspergillus niger). a  standard antioxidant assay was performed on the plant extracts to assess their capability in scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph). of the five tested plant extract, only rosmarinus offcinalis extract contained significant antimicrobial activity against all eight microbial isolates including pseudomonas aeruginosa. extracts from other four plants exhibited a variable antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms, except pseudomonas aeruginosa. significant antioxidant activity was detected in all plant extracts. however, extracts from pisidium guajava leaves contained significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to the other extracts tested. the antimicrobial and scavenging activities detected in this in vitro study in extracts from the five palestinian  medicinal plants suggest that further study is needed to identify active compounds to target diseases caused by a wide-spectrum pathogens.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == developing a microbiological growth inhibition screening assay for the detection  of 27 veterinary drugs from 13 different classes in animal feedingstuffs.
AB  == many regulations prohibit using veterinary drugs in feedingstuffs to protect consumers and animals alike. within this investigation we developed a simple, cost-efficient primary screening method for detecting antibiotics and coccidiostats in animal feeds. thirty-two veterinary drugs were originally considered. following matrix-free testing to optimise detection, an assay based on matrix extraction with methanol/acetonitrile/phosphate buffer followed by inoculation and diffusion in agar plates was developed. final validation was performed with 14 representative drugs (one per drug class) and four bacteria (escherichia coli atcc11303 and atcc27166, staphylococcus aureus atcc6538p, micrococcus luteus atcc9341) in bovine, lamb and swine fodder, measuring growth inhibition zones. of the original drugs tested, 27 remained detectable in feed matrices at or below 20 mg kg(-1). of the 14 validated representatives, two had estimated minimum detectable concentrations of 10-11 mg kg(-1), others of 5 mg kg(-1) or lower, an earlier minimum european union inclusion rate for many veterinary drugs. no significant matrix effect on inhibition zones was detected.  per cent wrong negative deviations ranged from 0% (nine of 14 compounds) to 20-27% (two of 14), while inter-day precision based on inhibition zones had relative standard deviations (rsds) of 6-109% (mean of 40%). when setting a 1 mm  inhibition zone, the maximum observed for negative controls, as a cut-off level,  no false-positives were found. while not all targeted antibiotics were detectable in complex matrices, the majority of veterinary drugs were detected with reasonable sensitivity, indicating that this method could be suitable for screening feedingstuffs prior to further confirmatory investigation of positive findings such as by lc-ms/ms.

TI  == identification and functional analysis of the peptidoglycan recognition protein ld gene in the mosquito, armigeres subalbatus.
AB  == peptidoglycan recognition proteins are important recognition proteins in many organisms ranging from echinoderms to humans. in an attempt to characterize all the pgrps in the mosquito armigeres subalbatus, two pgrp-ld isoforms, aspgrp-lda  and aspgrp-ldb, which are orthologs of the pgrp-lds in several other insect species, were identified from this mosquito using homologous cloning. to date the functions of this pgrp gene have not yet been described in detail in other organisms with a known pgrp-ld gene. in the current study, we analyzed the sequences of these aspgrp-lds, their evolutionary relationships with their orthologs, their transcriptional expression in various developmental stages and different tissue samples, and their transcriptional responses to different bacterial stimuli. we then knocked down the expression of both aspgrp-lds by injection of double-stranded rnas, and assessed the impact of aspgrp-ld rnai on mosquito survival after bacterial challenges and on the transcriptional expression of a number of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == exposure to bacterial signals does not alter pea aphids' survival upon a second challenge or investment in production of winged offspring.
AB  == pea aphids have an obligate nutritional symbiosis with the bacteria buchneraaphidicola and frequently also harbor one or more facultative symbionts.  aphids are also susceptible to bacterial pathogen infections, and it has been suggested that aphids have a limited immune response towards such pathogen infections compared to other, more well-studied insects. however, aphids do possess at least some of the genes known to be involved in bacterial immune responses in other insects, and immune-competent hemocytes. one possibility is that immune priming with microbial elicitors could stimulate immune protection against subsequent bacterial infections, as has been observed in several other insect systems. to address this hypothesis we challenged aphids with bacterial immune elicitors twenty-four hours prior to live bacterial pathogen infections and then compared their survival rates to aphids that were not pre-exposed to bacterial signals. using two aphid genotypes, we found no evidence for immune protection conferred by immune priming during infections with either serratia marcescens or with escherichia coli. immune priming was not altered by the presence of facultative, beneficial symbionts in the aphids. in the absence of inducible immune protection, aphids may allocate energy towards other defense traits, including production of offspring with wings that could escape deteriorating conditions. to test this, we monitored the ratio of winged to unwinged offspring produced by adult mothers of a single clone that had been exposed to bacterial immune elicitors, to live e. coli infections or to no challenge. we found no correlation between immune challenge and winged offspring  production, suggesting that this mechanism of defense, which functions upon exposure to fungal pathogens, is not central to aphid responses to bacterial infections.

TI  == a c-type lectin (aictl-3) from bay scallop argopecten irradians with mannose/galactose binding ability to bind various bacteria.
AB  == c-type lectins are a family of ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins playing crucial roles in innate immunity of vertebrates and invertebrates. in the present study, the cdna of a c-type lectin with one carbohydrate-recognition domain (crd) of 127 amino acids was cloned from bay scallop argopecten irradians  (designated aictl-3) by rapid amplification of cdna end (race) techniques based on expressed sequence tag (est) analysis. the mrna transcripts of aictl-3 could be detected in all the tested tissues including hepatopancreas, gonad, adductor muscle, heart, hemocytes, mantle and gill, with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. after the challenges with vibrio anguillarum and micrococcus luteus, the mrna expression level of aictl-3 was obviously up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 9h (11.87fold, p<0.01, and 20.02-fold, p<0.05, respectively). the recombinant aictl-3 (designated as raictl-3) could bind lps, pgn, and glucan in vitro, but could not bind mannan. and it also bound gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus as well as gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and v. anguillarum. with a ca(2+) binding site 2 epn (glu-pro-asn) motif, raictl-3 could bind both mannose and galactose which was quite different from those in vertebrate. meanwhile, it could significantly enhance the phagocytosis of scallop hemocytes in vitro. the results clearly suggested that aictl-3 could serve not only as a prr participated in the immune response against various pamps and bacteria in non-self recognition via mannose/galactose binding specificity but an opsonin playing an important part in clearance of invaders.

TI  == characterization and recombinant protein expression of ferritin light chain homologue in the silkworm, bombyx mori.
AB  == the silkworm genome encodes three iron storage proteins or ferritins, fer1hch, fer2lch, and fer3hch. probing our est library constructed from 1-day-old silkworm eggs revealed only fer2lch mrna, which encoded for a protein with a predicted putative n-glycosylation site. developmental and tissue expression analyses during embryogenesis revealed that fer2lch mrna was abundant from 6 h to 6 days after oviposition. transcriptional expression of fer2lch during the postembryonic stage is also high in the larval fat body and mid-gut, and then is upregulated in all pupal tissues tested. we found that fer2lch mrna contains an iron-responsive  element, suggesting this ferritin subunit is subject to translational control. although ferritin expression has been shown to increase following immune challenge in other insects, the levels of fer2lch mrna were not significantly induced following viral or bacterial infection of bombyx mori. using a baculovirus expression system we expressed recombinant bmfer2lch protein, which was detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction, likely in a compartment of the secretory pathway, and was shown to undergo posttranslational modifications including n-glycosylation. in particular, rbmfer2lch carbohydrate chains were composed of mannose and glcnac. we suggest that fer2lch is important for iron homeostasis and maintaining normal organ function in silkworms.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract for the preservation of large yellow croaker (pseudosciaena crocea).
AB  == background: chemical preservatives have been widely used to keep large yellow croaker fresh. however, the potential harm to human health cannot be ignored. this study was undertaken to investigate the antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract and to evaluate the efficacy of this natural product on the preservation of large yellow croaker. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of bayberry leaf extract against bacteria were 1.0 mg  ml(-)(1) for micrococcus luteus, 0.5 mg ml(-)(1) for staphylococcus aureus, 0.25  mg ml(-)(1) for escherichia coli, 0.5 mg ml(-)(1) for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.0625 mg ml(-)(1) for vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 0.03125 mg ml(-)(1) for listeria monocytogenes, respectively. this result was confirmed by the diameters  of inhibition zone (diz) assay. further studies showed that the bacterial growth  was significantly retarded when large yellow croaker was pretreated with bayberry leaf extract (2 g l(-)(1)) compared to that in the control group. moreover, the generation of total volatile basic nitrogenous compounds (tvb-n), atp degradation products (k-value) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (tbars) were significantly reduced compared to that in the control group. conclusion: our results demonstrated that the shelf life of large yellow croaker can be extended  when supplemented with bayberry leaf extract, which might have implications for natural preservatives.

AB  == plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plne, -f, -j and -k structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. these amplicons were cloned and expressed in pet32a (+) vector in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). plne, -f, -j and -k peptides were expressed as his-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. the peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. the cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against listeria innocua nrrl b33314, micrococcus luteus mtcc 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as enterococcus casseliflavus nrrl b3502, lactococcus  lactis lactis nrrl 1821, lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b4562 and lactobacillus plantarum nrrl b4496. e. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.

TI  == functional analysis of domain of unknown function (duf) 1943, duf1944 and von willebrand factor type d domain (vwd) in vitellogenin2 in zebrafish.
AB  == vitellogenin (vg), the precursor of egg-yolk proteins in all oviparous organisms, shares a similar domain structure combination. in most cases, vg contains the vitellogenin_n domain, the domain of unknown function (duf) 1943, and the von willebrand factor type d domain (vwd), which are present in different forms of vg from both vertebrates and invertebrates. occasionally, a duf1944 domain is also present in between duf1943 and vwd in some vg proteins of vertebrates. recent studies have shown that vg participates in immune defense of host with multiple functions. however, whether all vg proteins encoded by different vg genes play an immune role is unknown. in addition, the correlation of different domains in vg with the multiple immune functions remains completely unclear. here we demonstrated clearly that recombinant proteins, rduf1943, rduf1944 and rvwd from  zebrafish vg2 interacted with both the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus and the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and vibrio anguillarum, as well as their signature components lta and lps. moreover, both rduf1943 and rduf1944 promoted the phagocytosis of e. coli and s. aureus by carp macrophages. these suggest that both duf1943 and duf1944 as well as vwd may contribute to the function of vg as a pattern recognition receptor, and duf1943 and duf1944 also contribute to the function of  vg as an opsonin. this study also opens a new angle for identification of function of genes of unknown function, which have the domains duf1943 and duf1944.

TI  == immune competence in insect eggs depends on the extraembryonic serosa.
AB  == innate immunity is common to all metazoans and serves as a first line of defense  against pathogens. although the immune response of adult and larval insects has been well characterized, it remains unknown whether the insect egg is able to mount an immune response. contrary to drosophila, tribolium eggs develop an extraembryonic epithelium, the serosa. epithelia are well known for their ability to fight infection, so the serosa has the potential to protect the embryo against pathogens. to test this hypothesis we created serosa-less eggs by tc-zen1 parental rnai. we found that the tribolium egg upregulates several immune genes to comparable levels as adults in response to infection. drosophila eggs and serosa-less tribolium eggs, however, show little to no upregulation of any of the tested immune genes. we conclude that the extraembryonic serosa is crucial for the early immune competence of the tribolium egg.

TI  == engineering of ralstonia eutropha h16 for autotrophic and heterotrophic production of methyl ketones.
AB  == ralstonia eutropha is a facultatively chemolithoautotrophic bacterium able to grow with organic substrates or h2 and co2 under aerobic conditions. under conditions of nutrient imbalance, r. eutropha produces copious amounts of poly[(r)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (phb). its ability to utilize co2 as a sole carbon source renders it an interesting new candidate host for the production of renewable liquid transportation fuels. we engineered r. eutropha for the production of fatty acid-derived, diesel-range methyl ketones. modifications engineered in r. eutropha included overexpression of a cytoplasmic version of the tesa thioesterase, which led to a substantial (>150-fold) increase in fatty acid  titer under certain conditions. in addition, deletion of two putative beta-oxidation operons and heterologous expression of three genes (the acyl coenzyme a oxidase gene from micrococcus luteus and fadb and fadm from escherichia coli) led to the production of 50 to 65 mg/liter of diesel-range methyl ketones under heterotrophic growth conditions and 50 to 180 mg/liter under chemolithoautotrophic growth conditions (with co2 and h2 as the sole carbon source and electron donor, respectively). induction of the methyl ketone pathway  diverted substantial carbon flux away from phb biosynthesis and appeared to enhance carbon flux through the pathway for biosynthesis of fatty acids, which are the precursors of methyl ketones.

AB  == phage viruses that infect prokaryotes integrate their genome into the host chromosome; thus, microbial genomes typically contain genetic remnants of both recent and ancient phage infections. often phage genes occur in clusters of atypical g+c content that reflect integration of the foreign dna. however, some phage genes occur in isolation without other phage gene neighbors, probably resulting from horizontal gene transfer. in these cases, the phage gene product is unlikely to function as a component of a mature phage particle, and instead may have been co-opted by the host for its own benefit. the product of one such gene from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, stm3605, encodes a protein with modest sequence similarity to phage-like lysozyme (n-acetylmuramidase) but appears to lack essential catalytic residues that are strictly conserved in all lysozymes. close homologs in other bacteria share this characteristic. the structure of the stm3605 protein was characterized by x-ray crystallography, and  functional assays showed that it is a stable, folded protein whose structure closely resembles lysozyme. however, this protein is unlikely to hydrolyze peptidoglycan. instead, stm3605 is presumed to have evolved an alternative function because it shows some lytic activity and partitions to micelles.

TI  == insights into the different functions of multiple peptidoglycan recognition proteins in the immune response against bacteria in the mosquito, armigeres subalbatus.
AB  == peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps) are a group of proteins that recognize and/or bind to peptidoglycan on the surface of a number of pathogens. to understand the roles of multiple pgrps in the mosquito armigeres subalbatus (aspgrps), we studied the effects of infection of two bacteria, the gram negative escherichia coli and the gram positive micrococcus luteus, on the transcriptional expression of aspgrps and rna interference (rnai) of aspgrps on the immune responses of mosquitoes against the two bacteria. injection of e. coli or m. luteus into adult mosquitoes both significantly increased the transcription of aspgrp-s1, but not the other aspgrps. a mosquito survival assay using injection of e. coli or m. luteus into aspgrp double-stranded rna (dsrna) injected mosquitoes showed that rnai of aspgrps had different impacts on the survival abilities of mosquitoes, and that aspgrp-lcs seem to be the most critical ones. real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) analysis indicated that the expression of four antimicrobial peptides (amps) was dramatically changed after aspgrp-lb and aspgrp-lc rnai, although aspgrp-s1 and aspgrp-le had slight, but significant, effects, suggesting that the changes in survival abilities were potentially due to the changes in amp expression after aspgrp rnai. in addition,  bacterial challenges following aspgrp-lc rnai did not induce the expression of amps to their normal level as in control experiments. an in vivo assay indicated  that aspgrp-lc rnai had no significant effects on the phagocytic ability of the hemocytes, suggesting that aspgrp-lc is not a key factor mediating phagocytosis of bacteria in this mosquito.

TI  == phenolic content, antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity and phytochemical  composition of garcinia lancifolia.
AB  == garcinia lancifolia (clusiaceae) is an unexplored medicinal plant used as stomachic, diuretic and its fruit is used to cure dysentery and diarrhoea. the acidic fruits are used to prepare juice, pickle and curries. the phytochemical analysis of different extracts of g. lancifolia leaf, stem and fruit revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. the high phenolic content was observed in the methanol extract of leaf followed by methanol extract of stem and dichloromethane extract of leaf. the g. lancifolia fruit juice exhibited high antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus mutans, bacillus mycoides and bacillus subtilis. the methanol extract of fruit pulp was also very effective against gram-positive bacteria when compared with gram-negative bacteria. the radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl was highest in fruit juice followed by methanol extract of leaf and stem. all extracts showed concentration-dependent increase in the antioxidant activity.

TI  == a four-crd c-type lectin from chlamys farreri mediating nonself-recognition with  broader spectrum and opsonization.
AB  == c-type lectins are a superfamily of ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins consisting of at least one carbohydrate-recognition domain (crd), which  participate in nonself-recognition and clearance of invaders. in invertebrate, some multidomain c-type lectins have been identified, but their relative functions and binding mechanism are still meager. in the present study, a c-type  lectin (cflec-4) with four crds from chlamys farreri was selected to investigate  its possible function in innate immunity. the mrna expression of cflec-4 in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated (p<0.01) after the stimulations of beta-glucan, lps or pgn, and reached the highest expression level at 3, 6, 12 h post-stimulation, which was 27.9-, 22.6- or 47.9-fold of that in blank group, respectively. immunohistochemistry assay with polyclonal antibody specific for cflec-4 revealed that the endogenous cflec-4 was mainly located in the hepatopancreas, kidney and gonad of the scallops. the recombinant cflec-4 (rcflec-4) could bind lps, pgn, glucan and mannose in vitro, but could not bind lta. furthermore, rcflec-4 displayed a broader bacteria binding spectrum towards  gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus as well as gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, vibrio anguillarum and fungi pichia pastoris. meanwhile, rcflec-4 could significantly (p<0.01) enhance the phagocytosis of hemocytes in vitro. the results clearly suggested that four-crd containing cflec-4 not only served as prr with wider recognition spectrum, but also functioned as an opsonin participating in the clearance of invaders in scallops. it could be inferred that the diversity and complexity of crds in c-type lectins endowed these receptors with comprehensive recognition spectrum and multiple immune functions against complex living environment.

TI  == bacteriolytic activity of human interleukin-2.
AB  == in this paper we report the discovery of bacteriolytic activity of an immune system cytokine mediator, interleukin-2. bacteriolytic activity of interleukin-2  was compared with a well-known bacteriolytic enzyme - chicken egg white lysozyme  - by monitoring the lysis of the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli, the gram-positive coccus micrococcus luteus, and the gram-positive spore-forming bacillus bacillus subtilis. it was found that interleukin-2 has greater specificity to the gram-negative bacterium e. coli than does lysozyme. in contrast to chicken egg white lysozyme, interleukin-2 does not lyse the gram-positive coccus m. luteus and the gram-positive spore-forming bacillus b. subtilis. these results give a new understanding of the biological functions of interleukin-2, a regulatory protein that plays a role in oncological and infectious diseases.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

AB  == putative antifungal peptide encoding genes containing penicillium chrysogenum antifungal protein (paf) characteristic amino acid motifs were identified in 15 fusarium isolates, representing 10 species. based on the predicted sequences of mature peptides, discrepancy in one, two or three amino acids was observed between them. phylogenetic investigations revealed that they show high amino acid sequence similarity to paf and they belong to the group of fungal derived antifungal peptides with paf-cluster. ten from the 15 partially purified <10 kda  peptide fraction of fusarium ferment broths showed antifungal activity. the presence of approximately 6.3 kda molecular weight peptides was detected in all of the antifungally active ferment broths, and this peptide was isolated and purified from fusarium polyphilaidicum. the minimal inhibitiory concentrations of f. polyphilaidicum antifungal protein (fpap) were determined against different filamentous fungi, yeasts and bacteria. filamentous fungal species were the most  susceptible to fpaf, but some yeasts were also slightly sensitive.

TI  == expansion of the antimicrobial peptide repertoire in the invasive ladybird harmonia axyridis.
AB  == the harlequin ladybird beetle harmonia axyridis has emerged as a model species in invasion biology because of its strong resistance against pathogens and remarkable capacity to outcompete native ladybirds. the invasive success of the species may reflect its well-adapted immune system, a hypothesis we tested by analysing the transcriptome and characterizing the immune gene repertoire of untreated beetles and those challenged with bacteria and fungi. we found that most h. axyridis immunity-related genes were similar in diversity to their counterparts in the reference beetle tribolium castaneum, but there was an unprecedented expansion among genes encoding antimicrobial peptides and proteins  (amps). we identified more than 50 putative amps belonging to seven different gene families, and many of the corresponding genes were shown by quantitative real-time rt-pcr to be induced in the immune-stimulated beetles. amps with the highest induction ratio in the challenged beetles were shown to demonstrate broad and potent activity against gram-negative bacteria and entomopathogenic fungi. the invasive success of h. axyridis can therefore be attributed at least in part  to the greater efficiency of its immune system, particularly the expansion of amp gene families and their induction in response to pathogens.

AB  == functional variation of rpf, a growth factor found exclusively in actinobacteria, is differentiated by its source and amino acid sequences. only purified rpf proteins from three species have been studied so far. to seek new rpfs for use in future studies to understand their role in actinobacteria, the objective of this  study was to identify rpf gene homologs in tomitella biformata ahu 1821(t), a novel actinobacteria isolated from permafrost ice wedge. amplification using degenerate primers targeting the essential rpf domain led to the discovery of a new rpf gene in t. biformata. gene structure and the deduced rpf domain amino acid sequence indicated that this rpf gene was not identical to previously studied rpf. phylogenetic analysis placed t. biformata rpf in a monophyletic branch in the rpfb subfamily. the deduced amino acid sequence was 44.9% identical to rpfb in mycobacterium tuberculosis, the closest functionally tested rpf. the gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli; the recombinant rpf protein (rrpf) promoted the growth of dividing cells and resuscitated non-dividing cells  of t. biformata. compared to other studies, this rpf was required at higher concentrations to promote its growth and to resuscitate itself from a non-dividing state. the resuscitation function was likely due to the highly conserved rpf domain. this study provides evidence that a genetically unique but  functional rpf can be found in novel members of actinobacteria and can lead to a  better understanding of bacterial cytokines in this phylum.

AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == unraveling the antifungal activity of a south american rattlesnake toxin crotamine.
AB  == crotamine is a highly basic peptide from the venom of crotalus durissus terrificus rattlesnake. its common gene ancestry and structural similarity with the beta-defensins, mainly due to an identical disulfide bond pattern, stimulated us to assess the antimicrobial properties of native, recombinant, and chemically  synthesized crotamine. antimicrobial activities against standard strains and clinical isolates were analyzed by the colorimetric microdilution method showing  a weak antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) of 50->200 mug/ml], with the exception of micrococcus luteus [mic ranging from 1 to 2 mug/ml]. no detectable activity was observed for the filamentous fungus aspergillus fumigatus and trichophyton rubrum at concentrations up to 125 mug/ml. however, a pronounced antifungal activity against candida spp., trichosporon spp., and cryptococcus neoformans [12.5-50.0 mug/ml] was observed. chemically produced synthetic crotamine in general displayed mic values similar to those observed for native crotamine, whereas recombinant crotamine was overridingly more potent in most assays. on the other hand, derived short linear peptides were not very effective  apart from a few exceptions. pronounced ultrastructure alteration in candida albicans elicited by crotamine was observed by electron microscopy analyses. the  peculiar specificity for highly proliferating cells was confirmed here showing potential low cytotoxic effect of crotamine against nontumoral mammal cell lines  (hek293, pc12, and primary culture astrocyte cells) compared to tumoral b16f10 cells, and no hemolytic activity was observed. taken together these results suggest that, at low concentration, crotamine is a potentially valuable anti-yeast or candicidal agent, with low harmful effects on normal mammal cells,  justifying further studies on its mechanisms of action aiming medical and industrial applications.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == an improved implementation of effective number of codons (nc).
AB  == the effective number of codons (n(c)) is a widely used index for characterizing codon usage bias because it does not require a set of reference genes as does codon adaptation index (cai) and because of the freely available computational tools such as codonw. however, n(c), as originally formulated has many problems.  for example, it can have values far greater than the number of sense codons; it treats a 6-fold compound codon family as a single-codon family although it is made of a 2-fold and a 4-fold codon family that can be under dramatically different selection for codon usage bias; the existing implementations do not handle all different genetic codes; it is often biased by codon families with a small number of codons. we developed a new n(c) that has a number of advantages over the original n(c). its maximum value equals the number of sense codons when  all synonymous codons are used equally, and its minimum value equals the number of codon families when exactly one codon is used in each synonymous codon family. it handles all known genetic codes. it breaks the compound codon families (e.g.,  those involving amino acids coded by six synonymous codons) into 2-fold and 4-fold codon families. it reduces the effect of codon families with few codons by introducing pseudocount and weighted averages. the new n(c) has significantly improved correlation with cai than the original n(c) from codonw based on protein-coding genes from saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and mycoplasma genitalium. it also correlates better with protein abundance data  from the yeast than the original n(c).

TI  == intracellular toxicity of proline-rich antimicrobial peptides shuttled into mammalian cells by the cell-penetrating peptide penetratin.
AB  == the health threat caused by multiresistant bacteria has continuously increased and recently peaked with pathogens resistant to all current drugs. this has triggered intense research efforts to develop novel compounds to overcome the resistance mechanisms. thus, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been intensively  studied, especially the family of proline-rich amps (pramps) that was successfully tested very recently in murine infection models. pramps enter bacteria and inhibit chaperone dnak. here, we studied the toxicity of intracellular pramps in hela and sh-sy5y cells. as pramps cannot enter most mammalian cells, we coupled the pramps with penetratin (residues 43 to 58 in the  antennapedia homeodomain) via a c-terminally added cysteine utilizing a thioether bridge. the resulting construct could transport the covalently linked pramp into  mammalian cells. penetratin ligation reduced the mic for gram-negative escherichia coli only slightly (1 to 8 mumol/liter) but increased the activity against the gram-positive micrococcus luteus up to 32-fold (mic approximately 1 mumol/liter), most likely due to more effective penetration through the bacterial membrane. in contrast to native pramps, the penetratin-pramp constructs entered the mammalian cells, aligned around the nucleus, and associated with the golgi apparatus. at higher concentrations, the constructs reduced the cell viability (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)] approximately 40 mumol/liter) and changed  the morphology of the cells. no toxic effects or morphological changes were observed at concentrations of 10 mumol/liter or below. thus, the ic(50) values were around 5 to 40 times higher than the mic values. in conclusion, pramps are in general not toxic to mammalian cells, as they do not pass through the membrane. when shuttled into mammalian cells, however, pramps are only slightly cross-reactive to mammalian chaperones or other intracellular mammalian proteins, providing a second layer of safety for in vivo applications, even if they can enter some human cells.

TI  == combining in the melt physical and biological properties of poly(caprolactone) and chlorhexidine to obtain antimicrobial surgical monofilaments.
AB  == bacterial infections on a sutured wound represent a critical problem, and the preparation of suture threads possessing antimicrobial properties is valuable. in this work, poly(caprolactone) (pcl) monofilaments were compounded at the concentration of 1, 2 and 4 % (w/w), respectively, to the antiseptic chlorhexidine diacetate (chx). the incorporation was carried out in the melt by a single-step methodology, i.e. "online" approach. mechanical tests revealed that the incorporation of chx does not significantly change tensile properties of pcl  fibres as the thermal profile adopted to prepare the compounded fibres does not compromise the antibacterial activity of chx. in fact, chx confers to compounded  pcl fibres' antimicrobial property even at the lowest chx concentration as revealed by microbiological assays performed on escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis strains. the scanning electron microscope micrographs and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis of compounded threads revealed that chx is uniformly distributed on fibre surface and that the overall amount of superficial chx increases by increasing compounded chx concentration. this distribution determines a biphasic chx release kinetics characterized by an initial rapid solubilisation of superficial chx micro-crystals, followed by a slow and gradual release of chx incorporated in the bulk. interestingly, the compounded threads did not show any toxic effect compromising cell viability of human fibroblasts in vitro, differently from that observed using an equal amount  of pure chx. thus, this study originally demonstrated the effectiveness of an "online" approach to confer antimicrobial properties to an organic thermoplastic  polymeric material commonly used for medical devices.

TI  == tissue-enriched expression profiles in aedes aegypti identify hemocyte-specific transcriptome responses to infection.
AB  == hemocytes are integral components of mosquito immune mechanisms such as phagocytosis, melanization, and production of antimicrobial peptides. however, our understanding of hemocyte-specific molecular processes and their contribution to shaping the host immune response remains limited. to better understand the immunophysiological features distinctive of hemocytes, we conducted genome-wide analysis of hemocyte-enriched transcripts, and examined how tissue-enriched expression patterns change with the immune status of the host. our microarray data indicate that the hemocyte-enriched trascriptome is dynamic and context-dependent. analysis of transcripts enriched after bacterial challenge in  circulating hemocytes with respect to carcass added a dimension to evaluating infection-responsive genes and immune-related gene families. we resolved patterns of transcriptional change unique to hemocytes from those that are likely shared by other immune responsive tissues, and identified clusters of genes preferentially induced in hemocytes, likely reflecting their involvement in cell  type specific functions. in addition, the study revealed conserved hemocyte-enriched molecular repertoires, which might be implicated in core hemocyte function by cross-species meta-analysis of microarray expression data from anopheles gambiae and drosophila melanogaster.

TI  == an integrin from shrimp litopenaeus vannamei mediated microbial agglutination and cell proliferation.
AB  == background: integrins are a family of adhesion receptors which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, leukocyte migration, and complement receptor-dependent phagocytosis. in invertebrates, as a cell adhesion receptor, beta integrins play an important role for the balanced activation of immune defense responses especially during the encounter of infections. the present study attempts to characterize the immune functions of shrimp integrin (lvintegrin) to have better understanding on the immune system and its regulation mechanisms in shrimps. methodology: a shrimp integrin was identified from the pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei (designated as lvintegrin). its full-length cdna was of 2621 bp with an open reading frame (orf) of 2439 bp encoding a polypeptide of 812 amino acids. the mrna expression of lvintegrin was  significantly up-regulated at 3, 6 and 12 h after listonella anguillarum challenge. the cdna fragment encoding beta integrin domains (betaa and hybrid domain) of lvintegrin was recombined and expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3)-plyss. the recombinant protein (rlvintegrin) could significantly agglutinate the tested microbe including e. coli jm109, l. anguillarum, micrococcus luteus and candida dattiladattila in the presence of divalent cations. moreover, when nih3t3 cells were cultured with rlvintegrin, the proliferation rate increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. conclusions: lvintegrin, a shrimp beta integrin was identified from l. vannamei,  shared several highly conserved features. lvintegrin exhibited broad-spectrum agglutination activity towards both bacteria and fungi and could improve the proliferation of nih3t3 cells, indicating that lvintegrin is involved in the immune response against microbe challenge and regulation of cell proliferation as a cell adhesion receptor in shrimp.

TI  == purification and characterization of yfgap, a gapdh-related novel antimicrobial peptide, from the skin of yellowfin tuna, thunnus albacares.
AB  == a 3.4 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of the yellowfin tuna, thunnus albacares, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c(18) reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the n-terminus of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh); thus, this peptide was designated as the yellowfin tuna gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide (yfgap). yfgap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 1.2-17.0 mug/ml), and gram-negative bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli d31, and vibrio parahaemolyticus (mecs, 3.1-12.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. according to the secondary structural prediction  and the homology modeling, this peptide forms an amphipathic structure and consists of three secondary structural motifs including one alpha-helix and two parallel beta-strands. this peptide did not show membrane permeabilization ability and its activity was bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. this is the first report of the isolation of an antimicrobial peptide from a tuna species and the first description of the antimicrobial function of the n-terminus of gapdh of an animal species.

TI  == involvement of nf-kappab transcription factors in antimicrobial peptide gene induction in the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum.
AB  == we previously demonstrated that tribolium castaneum antimicrobical peptide (amp)  genes can be classified to imd-dependent group i, toll-dependent group iii and co-dependent group ii genes besides non-inducible group iv. here, we focused on nf-kappab transcription factor genes, dif1, dif2 and rel, and examined their functions in amp gene induction as well as linkages to the toll or imd pathway. imd-dependent group i and toll-dependent group iii genes were revealed to be rel- and dif-dependent respectively through knockdown experiments, indicating that the pathway specificity of nf-kappab classes found in drosophila is also conserved in t. castaneum. the toll-dif and imd-rel pathways of t. castaneum were activated concomitantly by single microbe species, which may represent a distinctive feature of its immune responses. in addition, rel knockdown impaired host defense against two model bacterial pathogens. finally, potential kappab motifs were searched in the regulatory regions of amp genes, and relevance to respective nf-kappab transcription factors was discussed.

TI  == antibacterial activities of polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate coated silver nanoparticles in normal and multi-drug resistant bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles coated with different functionalizing agents i.e., polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate were evaluated on both normal and multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. under the same reaction conditions, these functionalizing agents were added separately to coat silver nanoparticles. among these, polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles were most effective in killing all the bacterial strains which includes escherichia coli dh5a, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of shigella spp. (flexneri, boydii, sohnea) and vibrio cholerae. the minimum inhibitory concentration of polyethylene glycol coated silver nanoparticles was also less compared to the other two sets of nanoparticles. consistence with that polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles produced more intracellular reactive oxygen species in bacteria. moreover, when human cell lines mcf7 and chang liver  were incubated in presence of these nanoparticles for 18 h with same concentrations as used for bacteria, no toxicity was observed. but significant increase in cell killing was observed with longer incubation time. thus our present investigation implicates the potential therapeutic use of silver nanoparticles as antibacterial agent particularly the polyethylene glycol coated  one.

TI  == chemical characterization of bioactive compounds from the endophytic fungus diaporthe helianthi isolated from luehea divaricata.
AB  == endophytic microorganisms, defined as fungi or bacteria that colonize the interior of plants without causing any immediate negative effects or damages, have reciprocal relationships with host plants. in some cases their presence is beneficial to the host due to the synthesis of bioactive compounds, among which several alcohols, esters, ketones and others that may react with other compounds  and may be lethal to pathogenic microorganisms. diaporthe helianthi (phomopsis helianthi in its anamorphic phase) is available worldwide, especially in europe,  asia and america. isolated in europe as an agent of the sunflower stem cancer, it has also been endophytically isolated from tropical and temperate plants. a d. helianthi strain isolated from luehea divaricata has been employed in current research. an investigation of the secondary metabolite from d. helianthi by cc and nmr of (1)h and (13)c yielded the separation of 10 fractions and the identification of the phenolic compound 2(-4 hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol (tyrosol). its antimicrobial reaction was tested and the ensuing antagonistic effects on the human pathogenic bacteria enterococcus hirae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, phytopathogenic xanthomonas asc. phaseoli and phytopathogenic fungi were demonstrated. results show that bioactive compounds and tyrosol produced by d. helianthi have a biotechnological potential.

TI  == a novel c1qdc protein acting as pattern recognition receptor in scallop argopecten irradians.
AB  == the c1q domain containing (c1qdc) proteins refer to a family of proteins containing the versatile charge pattern recognition globular c1q domain in the c-terminus, which could bind various ligands including pamps and trigger a serial of immune response. in this study, a novel c1qdc protein was identified from argopecten irradians (designated as aic1qdc-2). its full-length cdna was of 1062  bp with an open reading frame of 720 bp encoding a polypeptide of 240 amino acids containing a typical gc1q domain. this gc1q domain possessed the typical 10-stranded beta-sandwich fold with a jelly-roll topology common to all c1q family members, and shared high homology with most of the other identified gc1q domains. the mrna transcripts of aic1qdc-2 were mainly detected in hepatopancreas, and also marginally detectable in mantle, gonad, adductor, gill and hemocytes. its relative expression level in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated after challenges of fungi pichia pastoris gs115 (p < 0.05), gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus (p < 0.05) and gram-negative bacteria vibrio anguillarum (p < 0.05). the recombinant protein of aic1qdc-2 (raic1qdc-2)  could bind various pamps, including lps, pgn, polyi:c, mannan, beta-1,3-glucan as well as yeast-glucan, and displayed agglutinating activity to fungi p. pastoris gs115, gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli top10f' as well as v. anguillarum. all these results indicated that aic1qdc-2 could function as a pattern recognition receptor to recognize various pamps on different pathogens in the innate immune responses of scallop, and provided new clues to understand the role of invertebrate c1qdc proteins in the ancient complement system.

TI  == potamotrygon cf. henlei stingray mucus: biochemical features of a novel antimicrobial protein.
AB  == antimicrobial molecules are important components of the innate immune system in vertebrates. they have been studied widely in several fishes, but little is known about these defence factors in stingrays, which are thought to have less sophisticated adaptive immune systems when compared to other teleosts. stingrays  from the specie potamotrygon cf. henlei are distributed throughout the rivers of  central-west brazil, being the cause of numerous envenomations occurring in the dry seasons. in a previous study, we reported that the mucus of the stingray p. cf. henlei shows antimicrobial effects. here, to analyze the antimicrobial compounds from the mucus of p. cf. henlei, we employed solid-phase extraction, chromatographic separation followed by esi-ms, and edman degradation. a protein similar to the beta-chain of hemoglobin was identified, isolated and partially sequenced by edman degradation. this protein has a molecular weight of 16072.8 da, and was shown to be active against bacteria (micrococcus luteus and escherichiacoli) and yeast (candida tropicalis) without hemolytic activity. effects of this new protein in the microcirculation environment were also evaluated. the results obtained provide fundamental information for future basic  research, clinical diagnosis and development of new therapies to accident treatment. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a bioactive polypeptide from the mucus of a stingray.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of human secreted group iid phospholipase a2 results from both hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic activities.
AB  == the human secreted group iid phospholipase a(2) (hspla2giid) may be involved in the human acute immune response. here we have demonstrated that the hspla2giid presents bactericidal and ca(2+)-independent liposome membrane-damaging activities and we have compared these effects with the catalytic activity of active-site mutants of the protein. all mutants showed reduced hydrolytic activity against dopc:dopg liposome membranes, however bactericidal effects against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus were less affected, with the d49k mutant retaining 30% killing of the gram-negative bacteria at a concentration of  10mug/ml despite the absence of catalytic activity. the h48q mutant maintained ca(2+)-independent membrane-damaging activity whereas the g30s and d49k mutants were approximately 50% of the wild-type protein, demonstrating that phospholipid  bilayer permeabilization by the hspla2giid is independent of catalytic activity.  we suggest that this ca(2+)-independent damaging activity may play a role in the  bactericidal function of the protein.

TI  == a novel pcr-based method for high throughput prokaryotic expression of antimicrobial peptide genes.
AB  == background: to facilitate the screening of large quantities of new antimicrobial  peptides (amps), we describe a cost-effective method for high throughput prokaryotic expression of amps. eddie, an autoproteolytic mutant of the n-terminal autoprotease, npro, from classical swine fever virus, was selected as  a fusion protein partner. the expression system was used for high-level expression of six antimicrobial peptides with different sizes: bombinin-like peptide 7, temporin g, hexapeptide, combi-1, human histatin 9, and human histatin 6. these expressed amps were purified and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. results: two or four primers were used to synthesize each amp gene in a single step pcr. each synthetic gene was then cloned into the pet30a/his-eddie-gfp vector via an in vivo recombination strategy. each amp was then expressed as an npro fusion protein in escherichia coli. the expressed fusion proteins existed as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and the expression levels of the six amps reached up to 40% of the total cell protein content. on in vitro refolding, the fusion amps was released from the c-terminal end of the autoprotease by self-cleavage, leaving amps with an authentic n terminus. the released fusion partner was easily purified by ni-nta chromatography. all recombinant amps displayed expected antimicrobial activity against e. coli, micrococcus luteus and s. cerevisia. conclusions: the method described in this report allows the fast synthesis of genes that are optimized for over-expression in e. coli and for the  production of sufficiently large amounts of peptides for functional and structural characterization. the npro partner system, without the need for chemical or enzymatic removal of the fusion tag, is a low-cost, efficient way of  producing amps for characterization. the cloning method, combined with bioinformatic analyses from genome and est sequence data, will also be useful for screening new amps. plasmid pet30a/his-eddie-gfp also provides green/white colony selection for high-throughput recombinant amp cloning.

TI  == interaction of type a lantibiotics with undecaprenol-bound cell envelope precursors.
AB  == lantibiotics are a unique group within the antimicrobial peptides characterized by the presence of thioether amino acids (lanthionine and methyllanthionine). these peptides are produced by and primarily act on gram-positive bacteria exerting multiple activities at the cytoplasmic membrane of susceptible strains.  previously, the cell wall precursor lipid ii was identified as the molecular target for the prototype lantibiotic nisin. binding and sequestration of lipid ii blocks the incorporation of the central cell wall precursor into the growing peptidoglycan network, thereby inhibiting the formation of a functional cell wall. additionally, nisin combines this activity with a unique target-mediated pore formation, using lipid ii as a docking molecule. the interaction with the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid ii is crucial for nisin binding. we show that, besides binding to lipid ii, nisin interacts with the lipid intermediates lipid iii (undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-n-acetyl-glucosamine) and lipid iv (undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-n-acetyl-glucosamine-n-acetyl-mannosamine) of the wall teichoic acid (wta) biosynthesis pathway. binding of nisin to the precursors was observed at a stoichiometry of 2:1. the specific interaction with wta precursors further promoted target-mediated pore formation in artificial lipid bilayers. specific interactions with lipid iii and lipid iv could also be demonstrated for related type a lantibiotics, for example, gallidermin, containing the conserved lipid-ii-binding motif.

AB  == c-type lectins are a family of calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins. in the present study, a c-type lectin (designated as aictl5) was identified and characterized from argopecten irradians. the full-length cdna of aictl5 was of 673 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (utr) of 24 bp, a 3' utr of 130 bp with a poly (a) tail, and an open reading frame (orf) of 519 bp encoding a polypeptide of 172 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids.  a c-type lectin-like domain (crd) containing 6 conserved cysteines and a putative glycosylation sites were identified in the deduced amino acid sequence of aictl5. aictl5 shared 11%-27.5% identity with the previous reported c-type lectin from a. irradians. the cdna fragment encoding the mature peptide of aictl5 was recombined into pet-21a (+) with a c-terminal hexa-histidine tag fused in-frame, and expressed in escherichia coli origami (de3). the recombinant aictl5 (raictl5) agglutinated gram-negative e. coli top10f' and listonella anguillarum, but did not agglutinate gram-positive bacteria bacillus thuringiensis and micrococcus luteus, and the agglutination could be inhibited by edta, indicating that aictl5  was a ca(2+)-dependent lectin. raictl5 exhibited a significantly strong activity  to bind lps from e. coli, which conformed to the agglutinating activity toward gram-negative bacteria. moreover, raictl5 also agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes.  these results indicated that aictl5 could function as a pattern recognition receptor to protect bay scallop from gram-negative bacterial infection, and also  provide evidence to understand the structural and functional diverse of lectin.

TI  == antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of camellia sinensis.
AB  == background: the role of non-polymeric phenolic (np) and polymeric tannin (pt) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of camellia sinensis were investigated. materials and methods: total phenolic content (tpc) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (aeac) were assessed using the folin-ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) assays, respectively. minimum inhibitory dose (mid) against gram-positive micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus, and gram-negative. escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. the extracts were fractionated using sephadex lh-20 column chromatography to obtain the np and pt constituents. results: extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. yields of np fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of pt fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. for all six teas, antioxidant properties of pt fractions were significantly higher than extracts and np fractions. extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three gram-negative bacteria. green teas inhibited all three gram-positive bacteria with s. aureus being the least susceptible. black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of m. luteus and b. cereus, but not s. aureus. the most potent were the pt fractions of boh cameron highlands and ho yan hor with mid of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against m. luteus. conclusion: results suggested that np constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of c. sinensis. although pt constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.

TI  == antimicrobial peptide gene induction, involvement of toll and imd pathways and defense against bacteria in the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum.
AB  == using tribolium castaneum, we quantitatively investigated the induction of nine antimicrobial peptide (amp) genes by live gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae), gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis) and the budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). then, five representative amp genes were selected, and the involvement of the toll and imd pathways in their induction by e. coli, m. luteus and s. cerevisiae was examined  by utilizing rna interference of either myd88 or imd. results indicated: robust and acute induction of three genes by the two bacterial species was mediated mainly by the imd pathway; slow and sustained induction of one gene by the two bacteria was mediated mainly by the toll pathway; induction of the remaining one  gene by the two bacteria was mediated by both pathways; induction of the five genes by the yeast was mediated by the toll and/or imd pathways depending on respective genes. these results suggest that more promiscuous activation and usage of the two pathways may occur in t. castaneum than in drosophila melanogaster. in addition, the imd pathway was revealed to dominantly contribute  to defense against two bacterial species, gram-negative e. cloacae and gram-positive b. subtilis that possesses dap-type peptidoglycan.

TI  == functional analysis of two lebocin-related proteins from manduca sexta.
AB  == insects produce a group of antimicrobial peptides (amps) in response to microbial infections. most amps are synthesized as inactive precursors/pro-proteins and require proteolytic processing to generate small active peptides. here we report  identification and functional analysis of two lebocin-related proteins (leb-b and leb-c) from the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta. the mrna levels of leb-b and leb-c increased significantly in larval fat body and hemocytes after injection of escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and saccharomyces cerevisiae. western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibody to leb-b showed accumulation of large protein(s) and small peptide(s) in larval hemolymph after microbial injection. this result and the presence of rxxr motifs in the deduced amino acid sequences led to our postulation that leb-b/c may be inactive precursors that are processed in larval hemolymph to generate short active peptides. to test this hypothesis, we expressed and purified full-length and various fragments of leb-b and leb-c as thioredoxin (trx) fusion proteins. we found that fusion proteins could be cleaved by induced larval plasma, and the cleavage sites were determined by protein sequencing. antibacterial activity of peptide fragments was also verified using synthetic peptides, and active m. sexta lebocin peptides were located at the n-termini of leb-b/c, which are different from bombyx mori lebocins 1-4 that are  located close to the c-termini. in addition, we found that synthetic leb-b(22-48) peptide not only had higher antibacterial activity but also caused agglutination  of e. coli cells. our results provide valuable information for studying processing of lebocin precursors in lepidopteran insects.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activities of novel 2,5-diphenylindolo[2,3-e] pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c] [1,2,4]triazines.
AB  == the formation of (e)-3-{2-(2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-7-yl)hydrazono}indolin-2-ones 3 has been achieved by condensation of equimolar amounts of 7-hydrazino-2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine (1) and isatin (or isatin derivatives) 2 at room temperature. the (e)-products could be isomerized into corresponding the (z)-3 isomers. reactions of the latter fused heterocyclic hydrazones towards different electro-philic reagents yielded the corresponding 3-substituted derivatives 4-7. dehydrative cyclisation of the hydrazones 3 using  phosphorus oxychloride afforded the 2,5-diphenyl- indolo[2,3-e]pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c][1,2,4] triazines 13. the polyfused heterocyclic ring system 13 underwent electrophilic substitution reactions at position 4 rather than at position 3. the 3-bromo isomer of 17 was prepared by a sequence of reactions starting from 2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-7(6h)-thione (11). the orientation of the electrophilic attack was supported by spectroscopic and chemical evidence. some of the synthesized compounds were found to possess slight to moderate activity against the microorganisms bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides keep insect endosymbionts under control.
AB  == vertically transmitted endosymbionts persist for millions of years in invertebrates and play an important role in animal evolution. however, the functional basis underlying the maintenance of these long-term resident bacteria  is unknown. we report that the weevil coleoptericin-a (cola) antimicrobial peptide selectively targets endosymbionts within the bacteriocytes and regulates  their growth through the inhibition of cell division. silencing the cola gene with rna interference resulted in a decrease in size of the giant filamentous endosymbionts, which escaped from the bacteriocytes and spread into insect tissues. although this family of peptides is commonly linked with microbe clearance, this work shows that endosymbiosis benefits from cola, suggesting that long-term host-symbiont coevolution might have shaped immune effectors for symbiont maintenance.

TI  == activity and immunodetection of lysozyme in earthworm dendrobaena veneta (annelida).
AB  == in the present study, lysozyme-like activity against micrococcus luteus was detected in the coelomic fluid, the extract from coelomocytes, intestine and in the homogenates from cocoons of dendrobaena veneta. four hours after immunization with escherichia coli, the lysozyme activity in the coelomic fluid increased about three times and in the extract of coelomocytes - four times, in comparison  to the control. in three cases: of the coelomic fluid, the homogenates from cocoons and the extract from coelomocytes, the antibody against hewl (hen egg white lysozyme) recognized only one protein with a molecular mass of about 14.4 kda. in the coelomic fluid, apart from the protein with molecular mass of 14.4 kda the antibody directed against human lysozyme recognized an additional protein of 22 kda. using the bioautography technique after electrophoretic resolution of  native proteins in acidic polyacrylamide gels, two lytic zones of m. luteus were  observed in the case of the coelomic fluid and three after the analysis of the extract of coelomocytes and the egg homogenates. the results indicated the existence of several forms of lysozyme with a different electric charge in the analyzed d. veneta samples. the highest lysozyme activity in the intestine of d.  veneta was observed in the midgut. the antibody directed against human lysozyme indicated a strong positive signal in epidermal and midgut cells of earthworm.

TI  == interplay between thermal and immune ecology: effect of environmental temperature on insect immune response and energetic costs after an immune challenge.
AB  == although the study of thermoregulation in insects has shown that infected animals tend to prefer higher temperatures than healthy individuals, the immune response  and energetic consequences of this preference remain unknown. we examined the effect of environmental temperature and the energetic costs associated to the activation of the immune response of tenebrio molitor larvae following a lipopolysaccharide (lps) challenge. we measured the effect of temperature on immune parameters including phenoloxidase (po) activity and antibacterial responses. further as proximal and distal costs of the immune response we determined the standard metabolic rate (smr) and the loss of body mass (m(b)), respectively. immune response was stronger at 30 degrees c than was at 10 or 20 degrees c. while smr at 10 and 20 degrees c did not differ between immune treatments, at 30 degrees c smr of lps-treated larvae was almost 25-60% higher than smr of pbs-treated and naive larvae. in addition, the loss in m(b) was 1.9 and 4.2 times higher in lps-treated larvae than in pbs-treated and naive controls. the immune responses exhibited a positive correlation with temperature  and both, smr and m(b) change, were sensitive to environmental temperature. these data suggest a significant effect of environmental temperature on the immune response and on the energetic costs of immunity.

TI  == antibiotic production by myxobacteria plays a role in predation.
AB  == myxobacteria are predatory and are prolific producers of secondary metabolites. here, we tested a hypothesized role that secondary metabolite antibiotics function as weapons in predation. to test this, a myxococcus xanthus deltata1 mutant, blocked in antibiotic ta (myxovirescin) production, was constructed. this ta(-) mutant was defective in producing a zone of inhibition (zoi) against escherichia coli. this shows that ta is the major m. xanthus-diffusible antibacterial agent against e. coli. correspondingly, the ta(-) mutant was defective in e. coli killing. separately, an engineered e. coli strain resistant  to ta was shown to be resistant toward predation. exogenous addition of spectinomycin, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, rescued the predation defect of the ta(-) mutant. in contrast, against micrococcus luteus the ta(-) mutant exhibited  no defect in zoi or killing. thus, ta plays a selective role on prey species. to  extend these studies to other myxobacteria, the role of antibiotic corallopyronin production in predation was tested and also found to be required for corallococcus coralloides killing on e. coli. next, a role of ta production in myxobacterial fitness was assessed by measuring swarm expansion. here, the ta(-)  mutant had a specific swarm rate reduction on prey lawns, and thus reduced fitness, compared to an isogenic ta(+) strain. based on these observations, we conclude that myxobacterial antibiotic production can function as a predatory weapon. to our knowledge, this is the first report to directly show a link between secondary metabolite production and predation.

AB  == bacterial infection among the most common cultured mudfish clarias gariepinus in  africa, has become a cause of concern, because it constitutes the largest economic loss in fish farms. in order to provide useful biological data of the pathogens for good management practices, samples were collected monthly between january 2008 and december 2009 in three monoculture nursery ponds, located in three different positions: upriver (a, grassland), mid-river (b, mixed forest and grassland) and downriver (c, rainforest) along 200 km length of cross river floodplains, nigeria. a total of 720 fingerlings between 15.1 and 20.7 g were analyzed to determine the degree of infection. the bacterial pathogens were taken from their external surfaces, and were isolated and identified by standard methods. the caudal fins of fingerlings from pond a had the highest bacterial load (5.8 x 10(3) cfu/g), while the least counts (1.2 x 103 cfu/g) were identified on the head of fish from pond c, with flexibacter columnaris as the major etiological agent. pseudomonas fluorescens, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus were identified as co-isolates with p. fluorescens as dominant (0.7 x 10(2) cfu/ml) co-isolates in pond water. clinical signs of five white spots with red periphery appeared on the external surface of infected fish. all the fish sampled, died after 4 to 9 days.  there was no significant difference in the bacterial counts between different ponds, but the difference between fish organs/parts examined was significant. fish from these ponds are therefore potentially dangerous to consumers and highly devalued, with the economic impact to producers. preventive methods to avoid these infections are recommended.

AB  == in the present study, 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) were synthesized via the ring closure reactions of appropriate acid hydrazides with carbon disulphide. n-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[[5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetamide derivatives (3a-j) were obtained by the nucleophilic substitution reactions of 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) with n-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-chloroacetamides. the chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and fab(+)-ms spectral data  and elemental analyses. the synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activities against micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and candida albicans. all compounds except compound 3h exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa. among all compounds (3a-j), the compounds bearing 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring (3a-e) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against c. albicans. although compound 3j did not possess 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring, this derivative also exhibited the same level of anti-candidal activity. the compounds were also investigated for their cytotoxic effects using mtt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. compound 3a exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity, whereas compound 3g possessed the lowest cytotoxic activity against nih/3t3 cells.

TI  == obtaining antimicrobial peptides by controlled peptic hydrolysis of bovine hemoglobin.
AB  == under standard conditions, the peptides and specially the active peptides were obtained from either the denatured hemoglobin that all structures are completely  modified or either the native hemoglobin where all structures are intact. in these conditions, antibacterial peptides were isolated from a very complex peptidic hydrolysate which contains more than one hundred peptides having various sizes and characteristics, involving a complex purification process. the new hydrolysis conditions were obtained by using 40% methanol, 30% ethanol, 20% propanol or 10% butanol. these conditions, where only the secondary structure of  hemoglobin retains intact, were followed in order to enrich the hydrolyzed hemoglobin by active peptides or obtain new antibacterial peptides. in these controlled peptic hydrolysis of hemoglobin, a selective and restrictive hydrolysate contained only 29 peptides was obtained. 26 peptides have an antibacterial activity against micrococcus luteus, listeria innocua, and escherichia coli with mic from 187.1 to 1 mum. among these peptides, 13 new antibacterial peptides are obtained only in these new hydrolysis conditions.

TI  == characterisation of immune responses in the pea aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum.
AB  == the innate immune system of insects provides effective defence against a range of parasites and pathogens. the pea aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum, is a novel study system for investigating host-parasite interactions due to its complex associations with both well-characterised bacterial symbionts and a diversity of  pathogens and parasites, including several important biological control agents. however, little is known about the cellular and humoral immune responses of aphids. here we identify three morphologically distinct types of haemocytes in circulation that we name prohemocytes, granulocytes and oenocytoids. granulocytes avidly phagocytose gram negative escherechia coli and gram positive micrococcus luteus while oenocytoids exhibit melanotic activity. prohaemocytes increase in abundance immediately following an immune challenge, irrespective of the source of stimulus. pea aphids form melanotic capsules around sephadex beads but do not  form cellular capsules. we also did not detect any antimicrobial peptide activity in the haemolymph using zone of inhibition assays. we discuss these results in relation to recent findings from the pea aphid genome annotation project that suggest that aphids have a reduced immune gene repertoire compared to other insects.

TI  == effect of calcium and magnesium on the antimicrobial action of enterocin lr/6 produced by enterococcus faecium lr/6.
AB  == enterococci are well-known producers of antimicrobial peptides (enterocins) that  possess potential as biopreservatives in food. in this study, divalent cations and release of intracellular potassium were used to assess the mechanism of interaction and killing of enterocin lr/6 produced by enterococcus faecium lr/6 on three target gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, namely micrococcus luteus, enterococcus sp. strain lr/3 and escherichia coli k-12. whilst treatment  with enterocin lr/6 in all cases led to a significant loss of viability, suggesting a bactericidal mode of action, e. coli k-12 showed better tolerance than the other two strains. bacteriocins have generally been reported to create pores in the membrane of sensitive cells and this function is diminished by divalent cations. in this study it was shown that ca(2+) and mg(2+) markedly improved the viability of enterocin lr/6-treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. k(+) release as a sign of membrane leakiness was  higher in m. luteus compared with the other two test strains. in agreement with the viability response, pre-exposure to ca(2+) and mg(2+) substantially reduced the amount of k(+) leakage by m. luteus and enterococcus sp.; in the case of e. coli k-12, no leakage of k(+) was recorded. these results suggest that enterocin  lr/6, which possesses good antibacterial potential, may not be very effective as  a preservative in foods containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium.

TI  == antibacterial action of acetic acid soluble material isolated from mucor rouxii and its application onto textile.
AB  == acetic acid soluble material (acsm) is a chitosan-rich fraction isolated from the fungal cell wall materials. the final step in the traditional production of fungal chitosan is the separation of chitosan from the cell wall acsm via raising the ph to 9-10 followed by centrifugation. this step results in further undesirable economic and environmental effects. the goal of this paper is to avoid that by investigating the antimicrobial effect of the whole acsm from mucor rouxii dsm-1191 cell wall and its application on cotton fabrics. the treated fabrics were characterized through monitoring the textile physical properties and for the antibacterial activity against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus. results showed that mucor rouxii dsm-1191 has excellent potentials to be used for cell wall acsm production on industrial scale with a maximum content of 40% in dry mycelia. the obtained results indicated that the physical properties of the treated fabrics, as well as the antibacterial activity, were improved after treatment with fungal acsm.

TI  == continuous control of the flow in biochemical pathways through 5' untranslated region sequence modifications in mrna expressed from the broad-host-range promoter pm.
AB  == the inducible pm promoter integrated into broad-host-range plasmid rk2 replicons  can be fine-tuned continuously between the uninduced and maximally induced levels by varying the inducer concentrations. to lower the uninduced background level while still maintaining the inducibility for applications in, for example, metabolic engineering and synthetic (systems) biology, we report here the use of  mutations in the pm dna region corresponding to the 5' untranslated region of mrna (utr). five utr variants obtained by doped oligonucleotide mutagenesis and selection, apparently reducing the efficiency of translation, were all found to display strongly reduced uninduced expression of three different reporter genes (encoding beta-lactamase, luciferase, and phosphoglucomutase) in escherichia coli. the ratio between induced and uninduced expression remained the same or higher compared to cells containing a corresponding plasmid with the wild-type utr. interestingly, the utr variants also displayed similar effects on expression when substituted for the native utr in another and constitutive promoter, p1 (p(antitet)), indicating a broad application potential of these utr variants. two of the selected variants were used to control the production of the c(50) carotenoid sarcinaxanthin in an engineered strain of e. coli that produces the precursor lycopene. sarcinaxanthin is produced in this particular strain by expressing three micrococcus luteus derived genes from the promoter pm. the results indicated that utr variants can be used to eliminate sarcinaxanthin production under uninduced conditions, whereas cells containing the corresponding plasmid with a wild-type utr produced ca. 25% of the level observed under induced conditions.

TI  == recognition of microbial molecular patterns and stimulation of prophenoloxidase activation by a beta-1,3-glucanase-related protein in manduca sexta larval plasma.
AB  == detection of pathogenic invaders is the essential first step of a successful defense response in multicellular organisms. in this study, we have identified a  new member of the beta-1,3-glucanase-related protein superfamily from the tobacco hornworm manduca sexta. this protein, designated microbe binding protein (mbp), is 61% identical in sequence to bombyx mori gram-negative bacteria binding protein, but only 34-36% identical to m. sexta beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-1 and 2. its mrna levels were strongly up-regulated in hemocytes and fat  body of immune challenged larvae, along with an increase in concentration of the  plasma protein. we expressed m. sexta mbp in a baculovirus-insect cell system. the purified protein associated with intact bacteria and fungi. it specifically bound to lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide, diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycans (dap-pgs) from escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, but less so to laminarin or lys-type pg from staphylococcus aureus. the complex binding pattern was influenced by other plasma factors and additional microbial surface molecules. after different amounts of mbp had been incubated with larval plasma on ice, a concentration-dependent increase in phenoloxidase (po) activity occurred in the absence of any microbial elicitor. the activity increase was also observed in the mixture of plasma and a bacterial or fungal cell wall component.  the prophenoloxidase (propo) activation became more prominent when dap-pgs, micrococcus luteus lys-pg, or lipoteichoic acid was included in the mixture of mbp and plasma. statistic analysis suggested that a synergistic enhancement of propo activation was caused by an interaction between mbp and these elicitors, but not s. aureus lys-pg, lipopolysaccharide, curdlan, or laminarin. these data indicate that m. sexta mbp is a component of the surveillance mechanism and, by working together with other pattern recognition molecules and serine proteinases, triggers the propo activation system.

TI  == gram-negative and gram-positive antibacterial properties of the whole plant extract of willow herb (epilobium angustifolium).
AB  == the emergence of new pathogens and the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant strains in well-established pathogens during the past decade  represent a growing public health concern globally. with the current lack of research and development of new antibiotics by large pharmaceutical companies due to poor financial returns, new alternatives need to be explored including natural herbal or plant-based extracts with reported antibacterial properties. willow herb (epilobium angustifolium) preparations have been used in traditional aboriginal and folk medicine preparations externally as an antiphlogistic to treat prostate and gastrointestinal disorders and as an antiseptic to treat infected wounds. the authors hypothesized that a whole plant extract of willow herb would exhibit antimicrobial properties on a variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in culture. the authors found that, in comparison to growth controls, willow herb extract significantly inhibited the growth of micrococcus luteus (p < .01), staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), escherichia coli (p < .001), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < .001). they also found that willow herb extract inhibited the growth of bacteria in culture more effectively than vancomycin (p < .05) or tetracycline (p < .004). these results provide preliminary support for the traditional folkloric claim that the plant willow herb possesses antibacterial properties against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. given that whole plant extract was utilized for this study, further investigations are warranted to determine which specific part of the plant (i.e., leaves, stem, roots, and flowers) possess the antibacterial properties.

TI  == effect of flash-heat treatment on antimicrobial activity of breastmilk.
AB  == background and objectives: the world health organization recommends human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive mothers in resource-poor regions heat-treat expressed breastmilk during periods of increased maternal-to-child transmission risk. flash-heat, a "low tech" pasteurization method, inactivates hiv, but effects on milk protein bioactivity are unknown. the objectives were to measure flash-heat's effect on antimicrobial properties of lactoferrin, lysozyme, and whole milk and on the digestive resistance of lactoferrin and lysozyme. methods:  flash-heated and unheated breastmilk aliquots from hiv-positive mothers in south  africa were "spiked" with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and then cultured for 0, 3, and 6 hours. lysozyme and lactoferrin activities were determined by lysis of micrococcus luteus cells and inhibition of enteropathogenic e. coli, respectively, measured spectrophotometrically. percentages of proteins surviving in vitro digestion, lactoferrin and lysozyme activity, and bacteriostatic activity of whole milk in heated versus unheated samples were compared. results: there was no difference in rate of growth of e. coli or s. aureus in flash-heated versus unheated whole milk (p = 0.61 and p = 0.96, respectively). mean (95% confidence interval) antibacterial activity of lactoferrin was diminished 11.1% (7.8%, 14.3%) and that of lysozyme by up to 56.6% (47.1%, 64.5%) by flash-heat. digestion of lysozyme was unaffected (p = 0.12), but 25.4% less lactoferrin survived digestion (p < 0.0001). conclusions: in summary, flash-heat resulted in minimally decreased lactoferrin and moderately decreased lysozyme bioactivity, but bacteriostatic activity of whole milk against representative bacteria was unaffected. this suggests flash-heated breastmilk likely has a similar profile of resistance to bacterial contamination as that of  unheated milk. clinical significance of the decreased bioactivity should be tested in clinical trials.

TI  == bacteriostatic activity of the proregion of human hepcidin.
AB  == hepcidin was first identified as an antimicrobial peptide expressed in the liver. it was later demonstrated that hepcidin is in fact the long sought hormone that regulates iron homeostasis in mammals. hepcidin is encoded as an 84 amino acid prepropeptide that is successively cleaved to yield prohepcidin and the mature 25 amino acid hepcidin. both the bioactive 25-aa hepcidin and the 35-aa proregion are secreted by liver hepatocytes. the aim of the present study was to assess the antibacterial activity of the proregion peptide from human hepcidin. using a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to the proregion, we show that it is bactericidal against bacillus megaterium (25microm), and inhibits bacillus subtilis growth at high concentration (200microm). no synergistic interaction of  proregion and hepc25 against bacillus megaterium was seen. in a further step, the mode of action of proregion on bacillus megaterium was studied. it caused a slow  accumulation of the vital stain sytox in the bacteria, indicating that it did not destroy the microbial membranes through a detergent-like mechanism, even at concentrations (80microm) higher than those required to kill the bacteria. this result suggests that the target of proregion might be an intracellular component. finally, gel retardation assay showed that the dna binding ability of the hepcidin proregion was equivalent to that observed for magainin 2, an antimicrobial peptide which exerts its antimicrobial effect by interfering with intracellular nucleic acids. in conclusion, we speculate that the proregion of hepcidin may have bacteriostatic effects, and as such may contribute to the innate immune response.

TI  == a well protected intruder: the effective antimicrobial defense of the invasive ladybird harmonia axyridis.
AB  == the harlequin ladybird harmonia axyridis (coleoptera: coccinellidae) is a polyphagous predatory beetle native to central and eastern asia. since 2007 it has established all over central europe. in order to elucidate which defense strategy is responsible for its high resistance to diseases, we tested hemolymph  as well as eleven main components of the headspace of h. axyridis for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (bacillus subtilis, b. thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis, micrococcus luteus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli) and yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). while three of the volatile compounds weakly reduced the growth of microorganisms, hemolymph of adults and larvae of h. axyridis strongly inhibited the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as yeast. furthermore, we compared the antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph of h. axyridis and coccinella septempunctata. antimicrobial activity in h. axyridis was about a thousand times higher compared to hemolymph from c. septempunctata. in contrast to c. septempunctata, the antimicrobial activity in h. axyridis was present without prior challenge. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the hemolymph of h. axyridis was lowest against e. coli and yeast followed by b. subtilis, and was highest against entomopathogenic b. thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionidae. furthermore, mic values of the hemolymph obtained from live beetles were significantly lower than from frozen insects. this suggests that the active antimicrobial compound is affected by freezing and  subsequent thawing of the beetles. potential implications of our findings for the competitive advantages of h. axyridis over c. septempunctata are discussed.

TI  == biosynthetic pathway for gamma-cyclic sarcinaxanthin in micrococcus luteus: heterologous expression and evidence for diverse and multiple catalytic functions of c(50) carotenoid cyclases.
AB  == we report the cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster (crte, crtb, crti, crte2, crtyg, crtyh, and crtx) of the gamma-cyclic c(50) carotenoid sarcinaxanthin in micrococcus luteus nctc2665. expression of the complete and partial gene cluster in escherichia coli hosts revealed that sarcinaxanthin biosynthesis from the precursor molecule farnesyl pyrophosphate (fpp) proceeds via c(40) lycopene, c(45) nonaflavuxanthin, c(50) flavuxanthin, and c(50) sarcinaxanthin. glucosylation of sarcinaxanthin was accomplished by the crtx gene product. this is the first report describing the biosynthetic pathway of a gamma-cyclic c(50) carotenoid. expression of the corresponding genes from the marine m. luteus isolate otnes7 in a lycopene-producing e. coli host resulted in the production of up to 2.5 mg/g cell dry weight sarcinaxanthin in shake flasks. in an attempt to experimentally understand the specific difference between the biosynthetic pathways of sarcinaxanthin and the structurally related  epsilon-cyclic decaprenoxanthin, we constructed a hybrid gene cluster with the gamma-cyclic c(50) carotenoid cyclase genes crtyg and crtyh from m. luteus replaced with the analogous epsilon-cyclic c(50) carotenoid cyclase genes crtye and crtyf from the natural decaprenoxanthin producer corynebacterium glutamicum.  surprisingly, expression of this hybrid gene cluster in an e. coli host resulted  in accumulation of not only decaprenoxanthin, but also sarcinaxanthin and the asymmetric epsilon- and gamma-cyclic c(50) carotenoid sarprenoxanthin, described  for the first time in this work. together, these data contributed to new insight  into the diverse and multiple functions of bacterial c(50) carotenoid cyclases as key catalysts for the synthesis of structurally different carotenoids.

TI  == antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy of antineoplastic agent capped gold nanoparticles.

TI  == a new laboratory cultivation of paramecium bursaria using non-pathogenic bacteria strains.
AB  == in most studies dealing with the laboratory cultivation of paramecia (paramecium  bursaria), klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria are used to inoculate the medium. however, klebsiella pneumoniae is a typical pathogen, and its use is always associated with a risk of infection. the aim of the present research was to examine non-pathogenic bacteria strains as components of the medium for paramecium bursaria. the paramecia were incubated on lettuce infusions bacterized with different bacteria strains: bacillus subtilis dsm 10, bacillus megaterium dsm 32, escherichia coli dsm 498, micrococcus luteus dsm 348. a strain derived from the natural habitat of paramecium bursaria was used as the control one. experiments were conducted under constant light and in the dark. paramecia cells  were counted under a stereomicroscope on consecutive days of incubation. the obtained results show that the most intensive growth of paramecium bursaria occurs in the presence of escherichia coli dsm 498. the use of this strain as a component of the medium allows one to obtain a high number of ciliates regardless of the light conditions. it can be concluded that the paramecium bursaria cultivation procedure can be modified by using the non-pathogenic bacteria strain escherichia coli dsm 498 instead of klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [effect of immunization on the in vivo immunocytes reaction to foreign particles  in the larvae of the flesh fly calliphora vomitoria].
AB  == bacterial immunization of calliphora vomitoria larvae induces hemocytic defense reaction in response to abiotic foreign particles injections. this reaction depends on the larval age and, consequently, the immunocytes composition. the juvenile plasmatocytes which are abundantly present in the end feeding and crop emptying larvae are initially very active and their reaction rate does not depend on the immunization. the plasmatocytes i appear after crop emptying. immunization has a positive effect on their differentiation rate and, correspondently, the rapid progress in the defense response. the proportion of competent plasmatocytes in immunized larvae increases. the stable hyaline cells formation also depends on immunization, although elements of this response vary at different age steps. immunization of the end feeding and crop emptying larvae induces an increase in the percentage of hyaline cells, but alien particles injection does not provide additional stimulating effect. after crop emptying, immunization of wandering larvae ceases to exert an obvious direct influence, but significantly increases the sensitivity to charcoal injection. the emergence of foreign particles in the  hemolymph of immunized wandering larvae causes a rapid increase in the number of  hyaline cells due to prohemocytes and undifferentiated plasmatocytes differentiation.

AB  == the rate of calliphora vicina haemocytic defense reaction to foreign particles injection depends on the larval age and on the previous bacterial immunization. immunization of crop-empting larvae induces an evident increase in particles phagocytosis by juvenile plasmatocytes in 24 h after injection. both the hemogram and the pattern of cellular defense reaction change significantly after crop-empting. immunized larvae start intensive adhesion of foreign particles to plasmatocytes surface and formation of great aggregations of plasmatocytes (morules) no longer than in 34 min after injection. the period of particle-haemocyte adhesion is short-termed and no more than after 30 min cell aggregates dissociate and adhered charcoal particles pass to thrombocydoidal agglutinates. unimmunized control larvae of the same age have shown no adhesion and morules formation. in immunized wadering and diapausing larvae, formation of  capsules consisting of central thrombocydoidal agglutinate filled with alien particles and adherent plasmatocytes i is intensified. in contrast to moru-les, this capsule formation is not accompanied by charcoal particles adhesion to plasmatocytes. immunization of mature larvae of c. vicina shown no prominent influence on both the rate of phagocytosis and the hyaline cells differentiation. it might be supposed that the receptors system is complex and the immunization both the mechanisms of foreigners recognition (adhesion, morulation and incapsulation) and the far more lately occurring phagocytosis.

TI  == peptidoglycan recognition protein of chlamys farreri (cfpgrp-s1) mediates immune  defenses against bacterial infection.
AB  == peptidoglycan recognition protein (pgrp) is an essential molecule in innate immunity for both invertebrates and vertebrates, owing to its prominent ability in detecting and eliminating the invading bacteria. several pgrps have been identified from mollusk, but their functions and the underlined mechanism are still unclear. in the present study, the mrna expression profiles, location, and  possible functions of pgrp-s1 from zhikong scallop chlamys farreri (cfpgrp-s1) were analyzed. the cfpgrp-s1 protein located in the mantle, gill, kidney and gonad of the scallops. its mrna expression in hemocytes was up-regulated extremely after pgn stimulation (p<0.01), while moderately after the stimulations of lps (p<0.01) and beta-glucan (p<0.05). the recombinant protein of cfpgrp-s1 (designated as rcfpgrp-s1) exhibited high affinity to pgn and moderate affinity to lps, but it did not bind beta-glucan. meanwhile, rcfpgrp-s1 also exhibited strong agglutination activity to gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis and weak activity to gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli. more importantly, rcfpgrp-s1 functioned as a bactericidal amidase to degrade pgn  and strongly inhibit the growth of e. coli and staphyloccocus aureus in the presence of zn(2+). these results indicated that cfpgrp-s1 could not only serve as a pattern recognition receptor recognizing bacterial pgn and lps, but also function as a scavenger involved in eliminating response against the invaders.

AB  == lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. however, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct  of the tomato processing industry. in this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "bull's heart" and "cherry" varieties were analyzed against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus and trichophyton rubrum). regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis being the most susceptible one (mic: 2.5-10 mg/ml). concerning antifungal activity, "bull's heart" extracts were the most active. in  a general way c. albicans was the most susceptible species (mic: 5-10 mg/ml). the chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids,  phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.

TI  == pyrosequencing and characterization of immune response genes from the american dog tick, dermacentor variabilis (l.).
AB  == ticks continue to be a threat to animal and human health, and new and novel control strategies are needed for ticks and tick-borne pathogens. the characterization of the tick-pathogen interface and the tick immune response to microbial infections is fundamental toward the formulation of new control strategies for ticks and the pathogens they transmit. our overall hypothesis for  this research is that the tick immune system manages the maintenance of pathogens. therefore, discovery of tick immune response genes may provide targets for novel control strategies directed toward reducing vector competency and pathogen transmission. in these studies, 454 pyrosequencing, a high-throughput genomic sequencing method was used to discover tick genes expressed in response to bacterial and fungal infections. expressed sequence tags (ests) were analysed  from dermacentor variabilis ticks that had been injected with bacteria (escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus) or fungi (saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans) and ticks that were naturally infected with the  intracellular bacterium, anaplasma marginale. by this approach, ests were assembled into 5995 contigs. contigs fell into the five main functional categories of metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes and human diseases. we identified more than 30 genes that are likely to encode for proteins involved in tick immune function. we further analysed by reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) the expression of 22 of these genes in each of our bacterial or fungal treatment groups and found that seven were up-regulated. up-regulation of these seven genes was confirmed for bacterial, but not fungal treatment by quantitative pcr (qpcr). one of these products was novel, encoding a new tick defensin. our results clearly demonstrate the complexities of the tick immune system and mark new directions for further study and characterization of proteins that modulate microbial infections in the american dog tick.

TI  == a different repertoire of galleria mellonella antimicrobial peptides in larvae challenged with bacteria and fungi.
AB  == to date, functioning of insect humoral immune response is especially well described in diptera. the mechanisms of pathogen recognition, activation of signaling pathways and regulation of antimicrobial defense peptide expression are relatively well known. the present paper demonstrates evidence that the immune system of the lepidoptera moth, galleria mellonella, is also able to distinguish  between different classes of microorganisms and responds to the invading pathogen accordingly. g. mellonella larvae were challenged with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as with yeast and filamentous fungus cells. subsequently, 24, 48 and 72 h after immunization, the concentrations of lysozyme  and six defense peptides were determined in the hemolymph by the hplc technique.  the compounds studied demonstrated variability both in the kinetics of the increase as well as in the concentrations reached. the gram-negative bacterium and filamentous fungus were particularly effective immunogens, especially affecting the levels of lysozyme, galleria defensin, proline-rich peptide 2 and cecropin d-like peptide.

TI  == an insect multiligand recognition protein functions as an opsonin for the phagocytosis of microorganisms.
AB  == we characterize a novel pathogen recognition protein obtained from the lepidopteran galleria mellonella. this protein recognizes escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, and candida albicans via specific binding to lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, and beta-1,3-glucan, respectively. as a multiligand receptor capable of coping with a broad variety of invading pathogens, it is constitutively produced in the fat body, midgut, and integument  but not in the hemocytes and is secreted into the hemolymph. the protein was confirmed to be relevant to cellular immune response and to further function as an opsonin that promotes the uptake of invading microorganisms into hemocytes. our data reveal that the mechanism by which a multiligand receptor recognizes microorganisms contributes substantially to their phagocytosis by hemocytes. a better understanding of an opsonin with the required repertoire for detecting diverse invaders might provide us with critical insights into the mechanisms underlying insect phagocytosis.

TI  == involvement of manduca sexta peptidoglycan recognition protein-1 in the recognition of bacteria and activation of prophenoloxidase system.
AB  == although the importance of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps) in detecting bacteria and promoting immunity is well recognized in drosophila melanogaster and other insect species, such a role has not yet been experimentally established for pgrps in the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta. in this study, we purified m. sexta pgrp1 from the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, tested its association with peptidoglycans and intact bacteria, and explored its possible link with the prophenoloxidase activation system in larval hemolymph. sequence comparison suggested that pgrp1 is not an amidase and lacks residues for interacting with the carboxyl group of meso-diaminopimelic acid-peptidoglycans (dap-pgs). m. sexta pgrp1 gene was constitutively expressed at a low level in fat body, and the mrna concentration became much higher after an injection of escherichia coli. consistently, the protein concentration in larval plasma increased in a time-dependent manner after the immune challenge. purified recombinant pgrp1 specifically bound to soluble dap-pg of e. coli but not to soluble lys-type pg of staphylococcus aureus. in addition, this recognition protein completely bound to insoluble pgs from micrococcus luteus, bacillus megaterium and bacillus subtilis, whereas its association with the bacterial cells was low even though their peptidoglycans are exposed on the cell surface. after pgrp1 had been added to plasma of naive larvae in the absence of microbial elicitor, there was a concentration-dependent increase in prophenoloxidase activation. phenoloxidase activity, as usual, increased after the plasma was incubated with peptidoglycans or bacterial cells.  these increases became more prominent when insoluble m. luteus or b. megaterium pg or soluble e. coli pg and pgrp1 were both present. statistic analysis suggested a synergistic effect caused by interaction between pgrp1 and these pgs. taken together, these results indicated that pgrp1 is a member of the m. sexta prophenoloxidase activation system, which recognizes peptidoglycans from certain  bacteria and initiates the host defense response. the unexplained difference between the purified pgs and intact bacteria clearly reflects our general lack of understanding of pgrp1-mediated recognition and how it leads to propo activation.

AB  == a phenol based novel schiff base polydentate symmetric ligand was prepared. the complexes were prepared by reacting ligand and the metal chlorides of cu (ii), ni(ii), co(ii) and fe(ii) in methanol to get a series of mononuclear complexes. the complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements, magnetic susceptibility data, ir, uv-vis, nmr and api-es mass spectral data. the mononuclear structure of the complexes was confirmed on the basis of elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility and api-es mass spectral data. the ligand and all the metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, s. aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 7064 and micrococcus luteus atcc 9345), one gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli atcc 4230), and three yeast (candida albicans atcc 14053, candida krusei atcc 6258 and candida parapsilosis atcc 22019) strains. therefore, newly synthesized the ligand and two complexes [(cu(ii) and co(ii)] showed good biological activity against all tested bacteria and yeast strains.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression of a crustin-like gene from chinese mitten crab, eriocheir sinensis.
AB  == crustin is a cysteine-rich antibacterial peptide which widely distributes within  decapod crustaceans. in the present study, the cdna encoding crustin-like peptide (designated cruses) was cloned from chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis by using rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) approaches and expressed sequence tag analysis. the full-length cdna of cruses was of 796bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (utr) of 214bp, a 3' utr of 267bp with a poly(a) tail, and an open reading frame (orf) of 315bp encoding a polypeptide of 104 amino acids including a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids. a wap domain and the consensus framework existing in class i crustins were both identified in cruses,  suggesting that cruses is a new member of type i crustins. quantitative real-time rt-pcr was employed to examine the expression of cruses, and its mrna transcript  was mainly detected in haemocytes and gill. the cruses mrna transcript in haemocytes was down-regulated after the challenge with gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus, while gram-negative bacteria listonella anguillarum did not induce significant variation of cruses mrna. the mature peptide of cruses was cloned into pet-21a(+) with a c-terminal hexa-histidine tag fused in-frame, and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant cruses inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria with low mic. the results indicate that cruses is a potent antibacterial protein against gram-positive bacteria infection, and it may play an important role in innate immune response of e. sinensis.

TI  == expression of acc-royalisin gene from royal jelly of chinese honeybee in escherichia coli and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == royalisin is an antibacterial peptide found in royal jelly. two gene fragments of chinese honeybee (apis cerana cerana) head, 280 bp cdna encoding pre-pro-acc-royalisin (ppar) of 95 amino acid residues, and 165 bp cdna encoding  mature acc-royalisin (mar) of 51 amino acid residues were cloned into the pgex-4t-2 vector. they were then transformed individually into escherichia coli for expression. two expressed fusion proteins, glutathione s-transferase (gst)-ppar of 36 kda and gst-mar of 32 kda were obtained, which were cross reacted with gst antibody accounting for up to 16.3% and 15.4% of bacterial protein, respectively. in addition, 41% of gst-ppar and nearly 100% of gst-mar were soluble proteins. both lysates of the two purified fusion proteins displayed antibacterial activities, similar to that of nisin against gram-positive bacteria strains, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus. mar peptide released from the thrombin-cleaved gst-mar fusion protein has a stronger  antibacterial activity than that of gst-mar fusion protein.

AB  == a new strain belonging to the genus collimonas was isolated from the sea surface  microlayer off the coast of trondelag, norway. the bacterium, designated collimonas ct, produced an antibacterial compound active against micrococcus luteus. subsequent studies using lc-ms identified this antibacterial compound as  violacein, known to be produced by several marine-derived bacteria. fragments of  the violacein biosynthesis genes vioa and viob were amplified by pcr from the collimonas ct genome and sequenced. phylogenetic analysis of these sequences demonstrated close relatedness of the collimonas ct violacein biosynthetic gene cluster to those in janthinobacterium lividum and duganella sp., suggesting relatively recent horizontal gene transfer. considering diverse biological activities of violacein, collimonas ct shall be further studied as a potential producer of this compound.

TI  == aictl-6, a novel c-type lectin from bay scallop argopecten irradians with a long  c-type lectin-like domain.
AB  == c-type lectins are a superfamily of carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play  crucial roles in the innate immunity. in this study, a novel c-type lectin gene from scallop argopecten irradians (designated as aictl-6) was cloned by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) approach based on expression sequence tag (est) analysis. the full-length cdna of aictl-6 was 1080 bp. the open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 307 amino acids, including a signal sequence and a c-type lectin-like domain (ctld) of 150 amino acid residues longer than any usual ctld. it contained six conserved cysteine residues involved in the formation of three internal disulfide bridges and an epd (glu(269)-pro(270)-asp(271)) motif at the ca(2+)-binding site 2. the deduced amino acid sequence of aictl-6 showed high similarity to members of c-type lectin superfamily. by fluorescent quantitative real-time pcr, aictl-6 mrna was found mainly in hepatopancreas and gill, and marginally expressed in other tissues. after the scallops were challenged by listonella anguillarum for 6 h, the mrna expression of aictl-6 was up-regulated significantly to 7.2-fold compared to the blank group. while at 9 h post micrococcus luteus challenge, its expression level was 60.1 times higher than that of the blank group. the functional activity of aictl-6 was investigated by recombination and expression of the cdna fragment encoding its mature peptide in  escherichia coli rosetta gami (de3). the recombinant aictl-6 could agglutinate gram-negative bacteria e. coli top10f', gram-positive bacteria m. luteus and staphylococcus aureus. these results collectively suggested that aictl-6, as a novel member of c-type lectin family, contributed to the host defense mechanisms  against invading microorganism in a. irradians.

TI  == genes involved in long-chain alkene biosynthesis in micrococcus luteus.
AB  == aliphatic hydrocarbons are highly appealing targets for advanced cellulosic biofuels, as they are already predominant components of petroleum-based gasoline  and diesel fuels. we have studied alkene biosynthesis in micrococcus luteus atcc  4698, a close relative of sarcina lutea (now kocuria rhizophila), which 4 decades ago was reported to biosynthesize iso- and anteiso-branched, long-chain alkenes.  the underlying biochemistry and genetics of alkene biosynthesis were not elucidated in those studies. we show here that heterologous expression of a three-gene cluster from m. luteus (mlut_13230-13250) in a fatty acid-overproducing escherichia coli strain resulted in production of long-chain alkenes, predominantly 27:3 and 29:3 (no. carbon atoms: no. c=c bonds). heterologous expression of mlut_13230 (olea) alone produced no long-chain alkenes but unsaturated aliphatic monoketones, predominantly 27:2, and in vitro studies with the purified mlut_13230 protein and tetradecanoyl-coenzyme a (coa) produced  the same c(27) monoketone. gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed the elemental composition of all detected long-chain alkenes and monoketones (putative intermediates of alkene biosynthesis). negative controls demonstrated that the m. luteus genes were responsible for production of these metabolites. studies with wild-type m. luteus showed that the transcript copy number of mlut_13230-13250 and the concentrations of 29:1 alkene isomers (the dominant alkenes produced by this strain) generally corresponded with bacterial population over time. we propose a metabolic pathway for alkene biosynthesis starting with acyl-coa (or-acp [acyl carrier protein]) thioesters and involving decarboxylative claisen condensation as a key step, which we believe is catalyzed by olea. such activity is consistent with our data and with the homology (including the conserved cys-his-asn catalytic triad) of mlut_13230 (olea) to fabh (beta-ketoacyl-acp synthase iii), which catalyzes decarboxylative claisen condensation during fatty acid biosynthesis.

TI  == differential transcriptomic responses of biomphalaria glabrata (gastropoda, mollusca) to bacteria and metazoan parasites, schistosoma mansoni and echinostoma paraensei (digenea, platyhelminthes).
AB  == a 70-mer-oligonucleotide-based microarray (1152 features) that emphasizes stress  and immune responses factors was constructed to study transcriptomic responses of the snail biomphalaria glabrata to different immune challenges. in addition to sequences with relevant putative id and gene ontology (go) annotation, the array  features non-immune factors and unknown b. glabrata ests for functional gene discovery. the transcription profiles of b. glabrata (3 biological replicates, each a pool of 5 snails) were recorded at 12h post-wounding, exposure to gram negative or gram positive bacteria (escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus, respectively), or infection with compatible trematode parasites (schistosoma mansoni or echinostoma paraensei, 20 miracidia/snail), relative to controls, using universal reference rna. the data were subjected to significance analysis for microarrays (sam), with a false positive rate (fpr) <or=10%. wounding yielded a modest differential expression profile (27 up/21 down) with affected features mostly dissimilar from other treatments. partially overlapping, yet distinct expression profiles were recorded from snails challenged with e. coli (83 up/20 down) or m. luteus (120 up/42 down), mostly showing up-regulation of defense and  stress-related features. significantly altered expression of selected immune features indicates that b. glabrata detects and responds differently to compatible trematodes. echinostoma paraensei infection was associated mostly with down-regulation of many (immune-) transcripts (42 up/68 down), whereas s. mansoni exposure yielded a preponderance of up-regulated features (140 up/23 down), with  only few known immune genes affected. these observations may reflect the divergent strategies developed by trematodes during their evolution as specialized pathogens of snails to negate host defense responses. clearly, the immune defenses of b. glabrata distinguish and respond differently to various immune challenges.

TI  == characterization of expression, activity and role in antibacterial immunity of anopheles gambiae lysozyme c-1.
AB  == there are eight lysozyme genes in the anopheles gambiae genome. transcripts of one of these genes, lysc-1, increased in anopheles gambiae cell line 4a3b by 24 h after exposure to heat-killed micrococcus luteus. lysozyme activity was also identified in conditioned media from the cell line from which the protein was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and gel filtration. mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein showed 100% identity to lysozyme c-1. purified lysozyme c-1 was tested against non-mosquito-derived as well as culturable bacteria isolated from mosquito midguts. lysozyme c-1 had negligible effects on the growth of most mosquito-derived bacteria in vitro but did inhibit the growth  of m. luteus. although lys c-1 did not directly kill most bacteria, knockdown of  lysc-1 resulted in significant mortality in mosquitoes subjected to hemocoelic infections with escherichia coli but not m. luteus thus suggesting that this protein plays an important role in antibacterial defense against selected bacteria.

TI  == expression and purification of an antimicrobial peptide by fusion with elastin-like polypeptides in escherichia coli.
AB  == different carrier molecules have been fused to antimicrobial polypeptides (amps)  to facilitate recombinant protein expression and purification. some of them have  improved the stability of amps and reduced the toxicity to host cells, but most current strategies still have some problems to be solved such as poor yield, low  purity, high expense, time-consumption, and difficulty in scaling-up. here, we introduced the elastin-like polypeptides (elps) as a fusion partner to express an antimicrobial polypeptide halocidin18 (hal18). by the reversible soluble-insoluble phase transition, 69 mg of the fusion protein were purified from 1 l of culture medium with the purity of nearly 95%. after cleavage with hydroxylamine, the elp's tag was easily separated from hal18 in the next round of inverse transition cycle and hal18 (1.7 mg, approximately 1.9 kda) was mainly found in the supernatant with a recovery of about 47% and purity of 60%. antimicrobial activity showed that hal18 had strong antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus but weak activity against pichia  pastoris.

TI  == hydroxytyrosol from tyrosol using hydroxyphenylacetic acid-induced bacterial cultures and evidence of the role of 4-hpa 3-hydroxylase.
AB  == hydroxytyrosol (htyr) is a potent natural antioxidant found in olive mill wastewaters. bacterial conversion of 4-tyrosol (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol) to htyr was reported in a limited number of bacterial species including pseudomonas  aeruginosa. in this work, we studied this conversion, taking as a model the newly isolated halomonas sp. strain htb24. it was first hypothesized that the enzyme responsible for 4-tyrosol hydroxylation in htyr was a 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid  3-hydroxylase (hpah, ec 1.14.13.3), previously known to convert 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-hpa) into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4-dhpa) in p. aeruginosa. cloning and expression of hpab (oxygenase component) and hpac (reductase component) genes from p. aeruginosa confirmed this hypothesis. furthermore, using cultures of htb24 containing 4-tyrosol, it was shown that 4-hpa accumulation preceded 4-tyrosol hydroxylation. we further demonstrated that the synthesis of hpah activity was induced by 4-hpa, with the latter compound being formed from 4-tyrosol oxidation by aryl-dehydrogenases. interestingly, similar results were obtained with other 4-hpa-induced bacteria, including p. aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and other halomonas, thus demonstrating general hydroxylating activity of 4-tyrosol by the  hpah enzyme. e. coli w did not have aryl-dehydrogenase activity and hence were unable to oxidize 4-tyrosol to 4-hpa and htyr to 3,4-dhpa, making this bacterium  a good candidate for achieving better htyr production.

TI  == lysozymes and lysozyme-like proteins from the fall armyworm, spodoptera frugiperda.
AB  == lysozyme is an important component of the insect non-specific immune response against bacteria that is characterized by its ability to break down bacterial cell-walls. by searching an est database from the fall armyworm, spodoptera frugiperda (negre et al., 2006), we identified five sequences encoding proteins of the lysozyme family. the deduced protein sequences corresponded to three classical c-type lysozymes sf-lys1, sf-lys2 and sf-lys3, and two lysozyme-like proteins, sf-llp1 and sf-llp2. sf-lys1 was purified from the hemolymph of escherichia coli-challenged s. frugiperda larvae. the mature protein had a molecular mass of 13.975 da with an isoelectric point of 8.77 and showed 98.3% and 96.7% identity with lysozymes from spodoptera litura and spodoptera exigua, respectively. as the other insect lysozymes, sf-lys1 was active against gram positive bacteria such as micrococcus luteus but also induced a slight permeabilization of the inner membrane of e. coli. genes encoding these five sf-lys or sf-llps were differentially up-regulated in three immune-competent tissues (hemocytes, fat body and gut) after challenges with non-pathogenic bacteria, e. coli and m. luteus, or entomopathogenic bacterium, photorhabdus luminescens. sf-lys1 and sf-lys2 were mainly induced in fat body in the presence  of e. coli or p. luminescens. sf-lys3, which had an acidic isoelectric point, was found to be the most up-regulated of all five sf-lys or sf-llps in hemocytes and  gut after challenge with p. luminescens. more molecular data are now available to investigate differences in physiological functions of these different members of  the lysozyme superfamily.

TI  == nitric oxide is an essential component of the hemocyte-mediated mosquito immune response against bacteria.
AB  == nitric oxide is a signaling and immune effector molecule synthesized by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. in mosquitoes, nitric oxide functions as a parasite antagonist in the midgut but little is known about its function in the hemocoel.  here, we characterized the temporal and spatial expression of the anopheles gambiae nitric oxide synthase gene and explored the role nitric oxide plays in the antibacterial response in the mosquito hemocoel. quantitative pcr and western blot analyses showed that nitric oxide synthase is expressed in hemocytes and fat body, and is upregulated in response to systemic infection with escherichia coli  and micrococcus luteus. diaphorase staining and immunofluorescence showed that nitric oxide synthase is abundant in the granulocyte subpopulation of hemocytes,  and both the staining intensity and the percentage of cells that stain for nitric oxide synthase significantly increase after a bacterial challenge. when nitric oxide production was inhibited, the mosquito's ability to kill e. coli was significantly reduced. accordingly, inhibiting nitric oxide production increased  the mortality rate of mosquitoes with systemic e. coli infections. taken altogether, these data show that nitric oxide is a crucial player in the antibacterial immune response in the mosquito hemocoel.

AB  == recently, beta-thymosin-like proteins with multiple thymosin domains (defined as  thymosin-repeated proteins) have been identified from invertebrate. in the present study, the cdnas of two thymosin-repeated proteins (designated estrp1 and estrp2) were cloned from chinese mitten crab by expressed sequence tags (est) techniques. blast analysis presented three and two thymosin domains in estrp1 and estrp2, respectively, with the identities amongst the five domains varying from 47% to 100%. both estrp1 and estrp2 shared high similarities with previously identified vertebrate beta-thymosins and invertebrate thymosin-repeated proteins  (trps) with the identities ranging from 43% to 78%, indicating that estrps were new members of the beta-thymosin family. real-time rt-pcr assay was adopted to determine the tissue distribution of estrps and their temporal expression profile in hemocytes after pathogen stimulation and injury challenge. the expression of estrp1 transcript was predominantly detectable in the tissues of hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gonad with the highest expression in hemocytes, while the highest expression level of estrp2 was found in heart. estrp1 mrna expression in  hemocytes significantly increased at 3 and 48h after listonella anguillarum challenge, but there was no significant variation in estrp2 temporal expression profile. the injury challenge reduced the mrna expression of estrps, with the down-regulation of estrp2 expression occurred earlier than that of estrp1. the cdna fragments encoding their mature peptides of estrp1 and estrp2 were recombined and expressed in escherichia coli. the activities of recombinant proteins (restrp1 and restrp2) were examined by mtt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) and lysoplate assay. restrp2 could significantly accelerate the growth of human hepatocellular  carcinoma cell line, but there was no significant effect of restrp1 on the tumor  cell proliferation. both restrp1 and restrp2 did not possess the ability of killing micrococcus luteus and l. anguillarum. the differences in the tissue distribution of mrna transcripts, the response to pathogen stimulation and injury challenge, and the effect of recombinant proteins on human cell proliferation, indicated that there were functional diversity between the two structurally different molecules, estrp1 and estrp2.

AB  == the discharge of untreated detergent-bearing waste introduces linear alklcylbenzene sulfonates (las) to the aquatic environment. the surfactant persists in some streams and rivers in nigeria, some is adsorbed to suspended materials and end in the sediment of the receiving water bodies. in this study, bacteria isolated from sediments of some tropical detergent-effluent-polluted streams were tested for tolerance to las using the media dilution technique. las-tolerance was indicated by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the surfactant. the ph, concentrations of surfactant, population of heterotrophic bacteria and population of las-tolerant bacteria in the sediments were determined. a direct relationship (r = 0.9124) was found between the alkaline conditions (ph= 8.2-12.0) and high surfactant concentrations (45-132 mg/g) in the sediment. the sediments harboured a high population and a wide variety of bacteria; the populations of viable heterotrophic bacteria (vhb: 2.9 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(7) cfu/g) and las tolerant bacteria (ltb: 1.5 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cfu/g) had a direct relationship (r = 0.9500). an inverse relationship resulted between each of them and the concentration of surfactant in the sediment, r(vhb/las) = -0.9303 and r(ltb/las) = -0.9143, respectively. twelve bacteria species were isolated from the sediment: alcaligenes odorans, bacillus subtilis,  burkholderia cepacia, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, micrococcus albus, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcusfaecalis. most of them were adapted to the surfactant with their maximum acceptable concentrations ranging between 0.03 and >1.0% (w/v). the sediments could serve as source of adapted organisms which can be used in bio-treatment of las-bearing waste.

TI  == the antibacterial and antifungal activity of a soda-lime glass containing silver  nanoparticles.
AB  == the antibacterial and antifungal activity of a low melting point soda-lime glass  powder containing silver nanoparticles has been studied. nano-ag sepiolite fibres containing monodispersed silver nanoparticles (d(50) approximately 11 +/- 9 nm) were used as the source of silver. this powder presents a high antibacterial (against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) as well as antifungal (against i. orientalis) activity. the observed high activity against yeast has been explained by considering the inhibitory effect of the ca(2+) lixiviated from the  glass on the growth of the yeast colonies.

TI  == discovery of anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 2 (apl_avbd2) with antibacterial and chemotactic functions.
AB  == the cationic, cysteine-rich peptides called beta-defensins play a major role in the innate immune response. here, we describe the identification and characterization of the duck beta-defensin-2 homologue, anas platyrhynchos avian  beta-defensin 2 (apl_avbd2). the 195 base pair open reading frame (orf) of apl_avbd2 has 83% identity with gga_avbd2 (chicken) and 85% identity with mga_avbd2 (turkey) at nucleotide level. the gene corresponding to the coding region is comprised of three exons and two introns in both apl_avbd2 and gga_avbd2. the predicted secondary structure of apl_avbd2 has the classical "beta-defensin core motif" formed by the beta-sheet rich structure. apart from mild expression in tissues like kidney, lung, brain, bursa of fabricious and ovary, apl_avbd2 mrna show a very high level constitutive expression in bone marrow and spleen, indicating that it is a myeloid defensin. purified recombinant apl_avbd2 demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of 3.7 microm against micrococcus luteus ncim 2871 and escherichia coli ncim 2685, and of 2.2 microm against reimerella anatipestifer. the immunomodulatory potential of apl_avbd2 was shown by chemotaxis of dt-40 chicken b-lymphocytes. the widespread tissue distribution and the potent bactericidal and chemotactic activity make apl_avbd2 an important molecule in the innate immune response in ducks. it may play a vital role in the immune response of these birds against bacterial and viral pathogens.

TI  == leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of  a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas  aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it  did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.

AB  == an antibacterial activity of apatite-coated titanium dioxide (tio2) against four  types of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and micrococcus luteus) was investigated. its antibacterial performance was observed under black light, visible light, and dark conditions. the number of viable bacteria decreased with irradiation time and became most prominent at 24 hours. distortion of bacterial cells by the nanoparticles was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. apatite-coated tio2 was fixed on cotton textiles by dip-coat technique, and the antimicrobial properties of corresponding fabrics were then investigated. the effect of irradiation source on antimicrobial activity of coated cotton fabrics was examined, wherein black-light irradiation demonstrated higher antibacterial activity than either visible-light irradiation or dark conditions. microbial populations of coated cotton fabrics decreased with increasing irradiation intensity. coated cotton fabrics have been shown to be nontoxic to human dermal fibroblasts. our findings suggest that the presence of apatite-coated tio2 shows  antibacterial activity in the presence of black light or visible light, suggesting its potential use in reducing the risk of microorganism transmission for textile applications.

TI  == binding and cellular activation studies reveal that toll-like receptor 2 can differentially recognize peptidoglycan from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than  direct binding to monitor recognition. we have employed surface plasmon resonance (spr) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from gram-positive (lysine-containing) and gram-negative (diaminopimelic  acid (dap)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (pgn). in the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from pgn remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. however, a wider range of dap-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled pgn. the difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of pgn. it was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and dap can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. cellular activation studies employing highly purified pgn from bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. the data firmly establish toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for pgn and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.

TI  == molecular characterisation of a goose-type lysozyme gene in atlantic cod (gadus morhua l.).
AB  == lysozymes are antibacterial enzymes important in the innate immune defense of several animal phyla. an atlantic cod goose-type (g-type) lysozyme est was identified in a suppression subtractive hybridisation (ssh) cdna library and the  full-length cdna (codg1) was obtained by race-pcr. the lysozyme gene is organised in five exons and four introns similar to g-type lysozyme genes in other fish species. two different cod lysozyme transcripts, named codg1 and codg2, seem to be produced by the use of alternative transcription start sites (tss) in the lysozyme gene. the alternative tss cause a different exon i usage where exon ia transcripts possess a putative signal peptide (codg1) while exon ib transcripts (codg2) lack this feature. lysozyme without the signal peptide was produced recombinantly in escherichia coli and displayed muramidase activity against micrococcus luteus cells at an unusually low ph. gene expression analysis of codg1 and codg2 showed that both were expressed in several tissues with highest expression in the head kidney, peritoneum and spleen. codg1 and codg2 were differentially expressed in some tissues. in the non-immunised control group, codg2 was expressed significantly higher in the head kidney compared to codg1, while an opposite expression profile was observed in the gills. compared to non-immunised fish, a significant up-regulation of codg2 transcripts was observed in the peritoneum and gills after injection of formalin inactivated listonella anguillarum indicating a role for g-type lysozyme in the innate defense system of cod.

TI  == a fibrinogen-related protein from bay scallop argopecten irradians involved in innate immunity as pattern recognition receptor.
AB  == the family of fibrinogen-related proteins (freps) is a group of proteins with fibrinogen-like domains. many members of this family play important roles as pattern recognition receptors in innate immune responses. the cdna of bay scallop argopecten irradians frep (designated as aifrep) was cloned by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) method based on the expressed sequence tag (est). the full-length cdna of aifrep was of 990bp. the open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 251 amino acids, including a signal sequence and a 213 amino acids fibrinogen-like domain. the fibrinogen-like domain of aifrep was highly similar to those of mammalian ficolins and other freps. the temporal expression of aifrep mrna in hemolymph was examined by fluorescent quantitative real-time pcr. the mrna level of scallops challenged by listonella anguillarum was significantly up-regulated, peaked to 9.39-fold at 9h after stimulation, then dropped back to 4.37-fold at 12h, while there was no significant change in the micrococcus luteus challenged group in all periods of treatment. the function of  aifrep was investigated by recombination and expression of the cdna fragment encoding its mature peptide in escherichia coli rosetta gami (de3). the recombinant aifrep (raifrep) agglutinated chicken erythrocytes and human a, b, o-type erythrocytes. the agglutinating activities were calcium-dependent and could be inhibited by acetyl group-containing carbohydrates. raifrep also agglutinated gram-negative bacteria e. coli jm109, l. anguillarum and gram-positive bacteria m. luteus in the presence of calcium ions. these results collectively suggested that aifrep functions as a pattern recognition receptor in the immune response of bay scallop and contributed to nonself recognition in invertebrates, which would also provide clues for elucidating the evolution of the lectin pathway of the complement system.

TI  == aedes fadd: a novel death domain-containing protein required for antibacterial immunity in the yellow fever mosquito, aedes aegypti.
AB  == microbial infections in insects activate a series of immune responses that culminate in the production of antimicrobial peptides (amps). in drosophila, two  signaling pathways, govern the challenge-dependent expression of amps; the toll and imd pathways. while amps have been the subject of much research in mosquitoes, the regulation of the pathways required for amp expression remains largely unknown. we report here the identification of aedes fadd (aefadd), a death domain protein in aedes aegypti. aefadd is expressed in all immune-competent tissues and all developmental stages examined. at the transcriptional level, aefadd transcripts increased when challenged with escherichia coli but not micrococcus luteus. in both cases, we observed the induction of two amp genes; cecropin and defensin. loss of aefadd function by dsrna interference impaired the inducible expression of both amps, and rendered adult mosquitoes susceptible to both types of bacteria. identifying molecules that regulate mosquito immunity may help elucidate the factors that contribute to the vectorial capacity and provide insights into general mechanisms that regulate innate immunity.

TI  == possible involvement of an extracellular superoxide dismutase (soda) as a radical scavenger in poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation.
AB  == gordonia westfalica kb1 and gordonia polyisoprenivorans vh2 induce the formation  of an extracellular superoxide dismutase (sod) during poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation. to investigate the function of this enzyme in g. polyisoprenivorans  vh2, the soda gene was disrupted. the mutants exhibited reduced growth in liquid  mineral salt media containing poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) as the sole carbon and energy source, and no sod activity was detectable in the supernatants of the cultures. growth experiments revealed that soda activity is required for optimal  growth on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene), whereas this enzyme has no effect on aerobic growth in the presence of water-soluble substrates like succinate, acetate, and propionate. this was detected by activity staining, and proof of expression was by antibody detection of sod. when soda from g. westfalica kb1 was heterologously expressed in the soda sodb double mutant escherichia coli qc779, the recombinant  mutant exhibited increased resistance to paraquat, thereby indicating the functionality of the g. westfalica kb1 soda and indirectly protection of g. westfalica cells by soda from oxidative damage. both soda from g. polyisoprenivorans vh2 and soda from g. westfalica kb1 coded for polypeptides comprising 209 amino acids and having approximately 90% and 70% identical amino acids, respectively, to the soda from mycobacterium smegmatis strain mc(2) 155 and micrococcus luteus nctc 2665. as revealed by activity staining experiments with the wild type and the disruption mutant of g. polyisoprenivorans, this bacterium harbors only one active sod belonging to the manganese family. the n-terminal sequences of the extracellular soda proteins of both gordonia species  showed no evidence of leader peptides for the mature proteins, like the intracellular soda protein of g. polyisoprenivorans vh2, which was purified under native conditions from the cells. in g. westfalica kb1 and g. polyisoprenivorans  vh2, soda probably provides protection against reactive oxygen intermediates which occur during degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene).

AB  == abstract the lysozyme from erwinia amylovora phage phiea1h was investigated for its ability to inhibit growth of bacteria and compared with the lysozyme from escherichia coli phage t4. the assays to measure lysozyme activity included cell  lysis and growth inhibition of bacteria. bacterial strains with kanamycin resistance were not affected by lysates containing the phiea1h-enzyme. the titer  of micrococcus luteus but not of erwinia amylovora was diminished by cell extracts containing t4 lysozyme. in contrast, phiea1h lysozyme preferentially inhibited e. amylovora, exceeding the t4 lysozyme activity at least one million-fold. spherical cells were formed after application to e. amylovora similar to lyz-gene expression in escherichia coli. heating of cell extracts destroyed the murami-dase activity, but retained an antibacterial activity. other plant-associated bacteria related to erwinia amylovora also were inhibited for growth when cell extracts with phiea1h lysozyme were applied to soak pear slices  and potato slices. ooze formation and soft rot caused by e. amylovora or e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, respectively, were strongly reduced and the phiea1h lysozyme was more efficient compared with extracts containing t4 lysozyme.

TI  == spring constants and adhesive properties of native bacterial biofilm cells measured by atomic force microscopy.
AB  == bacterial biofilms were imaged by atomic force microscopy (afm), and their elasticity and adhesion to the afm tip were determined from a series of tip extension and retraction cycles. though the five bacterial strains studied included both gram-negative and -positive bacteria and both environmental and laboratory strains, all formed simple biofilms on glass surfaces. cellular spring constants, determined from the extension portion of the force cycle, varied between 0.16+/-0.01 and 0.41+/-0.01 n/m, where larger spring constants were measured for gram-positive cells than for gram-negative cells. the nonlinear regime in the extension curve depended upon the biomolecules on the cell surface: the extension curves for the smooth gram-negative bacterial strains with the longest lipopolysaccharides on their surface had a larger nonlinear region than the rough bacterial strain with shorter lipopolysaccharides on the surface. adhesive forces between the retracting silicon nitride tip and the cells varied between cell types in terms of the force components, the distance components, and the number of adhesion events. the gram-negative cells' adhesion to the tip showed the longest distance components, sometimes more than 1 microm, whereas the shortest distance adhesion events were measured between the two gram-positive cell types and the tip. fixation of free-swimming planktonic cells by nhs and edc perturbed both the elasticity and the adhesive properties of the cells. here we consider the biochemical meaning of the measured physical properties of simple biofilms and implications to the colonization of surfaces in the first stages of  biofilm formation.

AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == brassica juncea bjchi1 is a plant chitinase with two chitin-binding domains. its  expression, induced in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate treatment, aspergillus niger infection, and caterpillar pieris rapae feeding, suggests that  it plays a role in defence. in this study, to investigate the potential of using  bjchi1 in agriculture, pichia-expressed bjchi1 and its deletion derivatives that  lack one or both chitin-binding domains were tested against phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria. transplastomic tobacco expressing bjchi1 was also generated and its extracts assessed. in radial growth-inhibition assays, bjchi1 and its derivative  with one chitin-binding domain showed anti-fungal activities against phytopathogens, colletotrichum truncatum, c. acutatum, botrytis cinerea, and ascochyta rabiei. bjchi1 also inhibited spore germination of c. truncatum. furthermore, bjchi1, but not its derivatives lacking one or both domains, inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, ralstonia solanacearum, pseudomonas aeruginosa) more effectively than gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus and bacillus megaterium), indicating that the duplicated chitin-binding domain, uncommon in chitinases, is essential for bacterial agglutination. galactose, glucose, and lactose relieved agglutination,  suggesting that bjchi1 interacts with the carbohydrate components of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall. retention of chitinase and bacterial agglutination activities in transplastomic tobacco extracts implicates that bjchi1 is potentially useful against both fungal and bacterial phytopathogens in  agriculture.

AB  == the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria drives the quest for new antimicrobials, including those that are not expected to readily engender resistance. one option is to mimic nature's most ubiquitous means of controlling  bacterial growth, antimicrobial peptides, which have evolved over eons. in general, bacteria remain susceptible to these peptides. human antimicrobial peptides play a central role in innate immunity, and deficiencies in these peptides have been tied to increased rates of infection. however, clinical use of antimicrobial peptides is hampered by issues of cost and stability. the development of nonpeptide mimics of antimicrobial peptides may provide the best of both worlds: a means of using the same mechanism chosen by nature to control bacterial growth without the problems associated with peptide therapeutics. the ceragenins were developed to mimic the cationic, facially amphiphilic structures  of most antimicrobial peptides. these compounds reproduce the required morphology using a bile-acid scaffolding and appended amine groups. the resulting compounds  are actively bactericidal against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including drug-resistant bacteria. this antimicrobial activity originates from selective association of the ceragenins with negatively charged bacterial membrane components. association has been studied with synthetic models of bacterial membrane components, with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, with vesicles derived from bacterial phospholipids, and with whole cells. comparisons of the antimicrobial activities of ceragenins and representative antimicrobial peptides  suggest that these classes of compounds share a mechanism of action. rapid membrane depolarization is caused by both classes as well as blebbing of bacterial membranes. bacteria express the same genes in response to both classes  of compounds. on the basis of the antibacterial activities of ceragenins and preliminary in vivo studies, we expect these compounds to find use in augmenting  or replacing antimicrobial peptides in treating human disease.

TI  == a novel c1q-domain-containing protein from zhikong scallop chlamys farreri with lipopolysaccharide binding activity.
AB  == the c1q-domain-containing (c1qdc) proteins are a family of proteins characterized by a globular c1q (gc1q) domain in their c-terminus. they are involved in various processes of vertebrates and supposed to be an important pattern recognition receptor in innate immunity of invertebrates. in this study, a novel member of c1q-domain-containing protein family was identified from zhikong scallop chlamys  farreri (designated as cfc1qdc) by expressed sequence tag (est) and rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) approaches. the full-length cdna of cfc1qdc was of 777 bp, consisting of a 5'-terminal untranslated region (utr) of 62 bp and a 3' utr of 178 bp with a polyadenylation signal sequence aataaa and a poly (a) tail. the cfc1qdc cdna encoded a polypeptide of 178 amino acids, including a signal peptide and a c1q-domain of 158 amino acids with the theoretical isoelectric point of 5.19 and the predicted molecular weight of 17.2 kda. the c1q-domain in cfc1qdc exhibited homology with those in sialic acid binding lectin from mollusks and c1qdc proteins from higher vertebrates. the typical 10 beta-strand jelly-roll folding topology structure of c1q-domain and the residues  essential for effective packing of the hydrophobic core were well conserved in cfc1qdc. by fluorescent quantitative real-time pcr, mrna transcripts of cfc1qdc were mainly detected in kidney, mantle, adductor muscle and gill, and also marginally detectable in hemocytes. in the bacterial challenge experiment, after  the scallops were challenged by listonella anguillarum, there was a significant up-regulation in the relative expression level of cfc1qdc and at 6h post-injection, the mrna expression reached the maximum level and was 4.55-fold higher than that of control scallops. similarly, the expression of cfc1qdc mrna in mixed primary cultures of hemocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (lps) was up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 6h post-stimulation, and then dropped back to the original level gradually. in order to investigate its function, the cdna fragment encoding the mature peptide of cfc1qdc was recombined and expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3). the recombinant cfc1qdc protein displayed a significantly strong activity to bind lps from e. coli, although no obvious antibacterial or agglutinating activity toward gram-negative bacteria e.  coli jm109, l. anguillarum and gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus was observed. these results suggested that cfc1qdc was absolutely a novel member of the c1qdc protein family and was involved in the recognition of invading microorganisms probably as a pattern recognition molecule in mollusk.

TI  == comparative orestes-sampling of transcriptomes of immune-challenged biomphalaria  glabrata snails.
AB  == the snail biomphalaria glabrata (gastropoda, mollusca) is an important intermediate host for the human parasite schistosoma mansoni (digenea, trematoda). anti-pathogen responses of b. glabrata were studied towards a better  understanding of snail immunity and host-parasite compatibility. open reading frame ests (orestes) were sampled from different transcriptomes of m line strain  b. glabrata, 12h post-challenge with escherichia coli (gram-negative), micrococcus luteus (gram-positive) bacteria or compatible s. mansoni, and controls. the resulting 3123 orestes represented 2129 unique sequences (373 clusters, 1756 singletons). of these, 175 (8.1%) were putative defense factors, including lectins, antimicrobial peptides and components of various immune-effector systems. comparison of biological processes (go-terms) within different transcriptomes indicated that b. glabrata increased oxygen transport and metal binding in reaction to all challenges. comprehensive comparisons of transcriptomes revealed that responses of b. glabrata against bacteria were similar to each other and differed from the ineffective response to s. mansoni. furthermore, the response to s. mansoni infection was less comprehensive than that to bacteria. many novel (unknown) sequences were recovered in association with particular challenges. b. glabrata possesses multi-faceted, potent immune defenses. this agrees with the notion that s. mansoni is capable of immune-evasion and prevents effective host defense responses in order to survive  in b. glabrata. future analysis of the numerous unknown sequences recovered from  challenged snails may reveal novel immune factors and provide increased understanding of immunity of b. glabrata in relation to parasite-host compatibility.

AB  == four bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus warneri,  and micrococcus luteus, were grown at temperatures of 23, 30, and 37 degrees c and were characterized by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometry (py-gc/dms) providing, with replicates, 120 data sets of retention time, compensation voltage, and ion intensity, each for negative and positive polarity. principal component analysis (pca) for 96 of these data sets exhibited  clusters by temperature of culture growth and not by genus. analysis of variance  was used to isolate the constituents with dependences on growth temperature. when these were subtracted from the data sets, fisher ratios with pca resulted in four clusters according to genus at all temperatures for ions in each polarity. comparable results were obtained from unsupervised pca with 24 of the original data sets. the ions with taxonomic features were reconstructed into 3d plots of retention time, compensation voltage, and fisher ratio and were matched, through  gc-mass spectrometry (ms), with chemical standards attributed to the thermal decomposition of proteins and lipid a. results for negative ions provided simpler data sets than from positive ions, as anticipated from selectivity of gas phase ion-molecule reactions in air at ambient pressure.

TI  == microbial production of plant benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.
AB  == benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, such as the analgesic compounds morphine and codeine, and the antibacterial agents berberine, palmatine, and magnoflorine, are synthesized from tyrosine in the papaveraceae, berberidaceae, ranunculaceae, magnoliaceae, and many other plant families. it is difficult to produce alkaloids on a large scale under the strict control of secondary metabolism in plants, and  they are too complex for cost-effective chemical synthesis. by using a system that combines microbial and plant enzymes to produce desired benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, we synthesized (s)-reticuline, the key intermediate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, from dopamine by crude enzymes from transgenic escherichia coli. the final yield of (s)-reticuline was 55 mg/liter within 1 h. furthermore, we synthesized an aporphine alkaloid, magnoflorine, or a protoberberine alkaloid, scoulerine, from dopamine via reticuline by using different combination cultures of transgenic e. coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. the final yields of magnoflorine and scoulerine were 7.2 and 8.3 mg/liter  culture medium. these results indicate that microbial systems that incorporate plant genes cannot only enable the mass production of scarce benzylisoquinoline alkaloids but may also open up pathways for the production of novel benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.

TI  == [study of ectoparasitism of ultramicrobacteria of the genus kaistia, strains nf1  and nf3 by electron and fluorescence microscopy].
AB  == transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (umb) strains nf1 and nf3,  affiliated with the genus kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. strains nf1 and nf3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive bacillus subtilis and gram-negative acidovorax delafildii. umb cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. the selectivity of parasitism of the studied umb to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects,  b. subtilis atcc 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium a. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to umb attack. other bacteria (micrococcus luteus vkm  ac-2230, staphylococcus aureus 209-p, pseudomonas putida bs394, escherichia coli  c 600, and pantoea agglomerans atcc 27155) were not attacked by umb. it was established for the first time that free-living umb may be facultative parasites  not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. the umb under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.

TI  == bovine hemoglobin: an attractive source of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == a peptic hemoglobin hydrolysate was fractioned by a semi-preparative reversed-phase hplc and some fractions have an antibacterial activity against four bacteria strains: micrococcus luteus a270, listeria innocua, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis. these fractions were analyzed by esi/ms and esi/ms/ms, in order to characterize the peptides in these fractions. each fraction contains at least three peptides and some fractions contain five peptides. all these fractions were purified several times by hplc to obtain pure  peptides. thirty antibacterial peptides were identified. from the isolated antibacterial peptides, 24 peptides were derived from the alpha chains of hemoglobin and 6 peptides were derived from the beta chains of hemoglobin. the lowest concentration of these peptides (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)) necessary to completely inhibit the growth of four bacteria strain was determined. the cell population of all of the tested bacteria species decreased by at least 97% after a 24-h incubation with any of the peptides at the minimum inhibitory concentration.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dextran-conjugated lysozyme against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in cheese curd.
AB  == the purposes of this research were to glycosylate lysozyme with dextran under maillard reaction conditions and assess the antimicrobial characteristics of the  lysozyme-dextran conjugate in a culture medium and cheese curd. solutions containing lysozyme and dextran were incubated at 60 degrees c and at 79% relative humidity. gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to follow the glycosylation  process. under optimum conditions 3.7 mol of dextran were coupled to 1 mol of lysozyme. lytic activity of the conjugate against the cell wall of micrococcus luteus was about 62% of that of native lysozyme. evaluation of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against test microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) in culture media indicated a progressive increase in antimicrobial activity, with an increase in enzyme-conjugate concentration. the lysozyme-dextran conjugate was also effective against e. coli in a natural food system, as it reduced the bacterial count by 3 log in cheese curd after 40 days of storage. unlike e. coli, the antimicrobial action of lysozyme against s. aureus was not improved by conjugation with dextran in both in vitro and in vivo  tests. antimicrobial activity of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against gram-negative bacteria is probably related to the remaining lytic activity as well as the excellent surfactant properties of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate. these results might increase the applicability of lysozyme as a natural antimicrobial ingredient in different food products.

TI  == nmr based structure-activity relationship analysis of an antimicrobial peptide, thanatin, engineered by site-specific chemical modification: activity improvement and spectrum alteration.
AB  == activity improvement of an antimicrobial peptide, thanatin, has been achieved up  to 4-fold higher than natural original one by site-specific chemical modifications with tert-butyl group at two cysteine residues which form an intramoleular disulfide bridge. the chemically modified thanatin (c11tbu/c18tbu)  exhibited improved antimicrobial activity toward gram-positive bacteria, micrococcus luteus, whereas lowered activity toward gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli. this finding suggests that disulfide-bridge formation is not only indispensable for exhibition of antimicrobial activity of thanatin but also  closely related to the activity specificity towards bacteria. nmr analysis indicates that thanatin acts against e.coli stereospecifically by taking advantage of its c-terminal beta-hairpin structure, while the activity against m. luteus does not relate to structures and correlates very well to side-chain hydrophobicity.

TI  == quantitation of bacteria through adsorption of intracellular biomolecules on carbon paste and screen-printed carbon electrodes and voltammetry of redox-active probes.
AB  == a new electrochemical method for the quantitation of bacteria that is rapid, inexpensive, and amenable to miniaturization is reported. cyclic voltammetry was  used to quantitate m. luteus, c. sporogenes, and e. coli jm105 in exponential and stationary phases, following exposure of screen-printed carbon working electrodes (spces) to lysed culture samples. ferricyanide was used as a probe. the detection limits (3s) were calculated and the dynamic ranges for e. coli (exponential and stationary phases), m. luteus (exponential and stationary phases), and c. sporogenes (exponential phase) lysed by lysozyme were 3 x 10(4) to 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu) ml(-1), 5 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) and 3 x 10(3) to 3 x 10(5) cfu ml(-1), respectively. good overlap was obtained between the calibration curves when the electrochemical signal was plotted against the dry bacterial weight, or between the protein concentration in the bacterial lysate. in contrast, unlysed bacteria did not change the electrochemical signal of ferricyanide. the results indicate that the reduction of the electrochemical signal in the presence of the lysate is mainly due to the fouling of the electrode by proteins. similar results were obtained with carbon-paste electrodes although detection limits were better with spces. the method described herein was applied to quantitation of bacteria in a cooling tower water sample.

TI  == immune system responses and fitness costs associated with consumption of bacteria in larvae of trichoplusia ni.
AB  == background: insects helped pioneer, and persist as model organisms for, the study of specific aspects of immunity. although they lack an adaptive immune system, insects possess an innate immune system that recognizes and destroys intruding microorganisms. its operation under natural conditions has not been well studied, as most studies have introduced microbes to laboratory-reared insects via artificial mechanical wounding. one of the most common routes of natural exposure and infection, however, is via food; thus, the role of dietary microbial communities in herbivorous insect immune system evolution invites study. here, we examine the immune system response and consequences of exposing a lepidopteran agricultural pest to non-infectious microorganisms via simple oral consumption. results: immune system response was compared between trichoplusia ni larvae reared on diets with or without non-pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus). two major immune response-related enzymatic activities responded to diets differently - phenoloxidase activity was inhibited in the bacteria-fed larvae, whereas general antibacterial activity was enhanced. eight proteins were highly expressed in the hemolymph of the bacteria fed larvae, among them immune response related proteins arylphorin, apolipophorin iii and gloverin. expression response among 25 putative immune response-related genes were assayed  via rt-qpcr. seven showed more than fivefold up regulation in the presence of bacterial diet, with 22 in total being differentially expressed, among them apolipophorin iii, cecropin, gallerimycin, gloverin, lysozyme, and phenoloxidase  inhibiting enzyme. finally, potential life-history trade-offs were studied, with  pupation time and pupal mass being negatively affected in bacteria fed larvae. conclusion: the presence of bacteria in food, even if non-pathogenic, can trigger an immune response cascade with life history tradeoffs. trichoplusia ni larvae are able to detect and respond to environmental microbes encountered in the diet, possibly even using midgut epithelial tissue as a sensing organ. potential benefits of this immune system priming may outweigh the observed tradeoffs, as priming based on environmentally sensed bacterial may decrease risk of serious infection. these results show that food plant microbial communities represent a dynamic and unstudied part of the coevolutionary interactions between plants and  their insect herbivores.

AB  == four monocationic cycloimide derivatives of chlorin p(6) (cicd) were studied as photosensitizers and compared to a structurally similar neutral derivative. cationic cicd are highly photostable (quantum yield of photobleaching is about 1  x 10(-5), generate singlet oxygen under irradiation (quantum yields are 0.3-0.45), can be involved in a photo-induced substrate-dependent generation of superoxide radicals, but do not produce oh . 17,18-delta-lacton 13(2)-(n-methylisonicotinylamido)-13,15-cycloimide mesochlorin p(6) () and 13(2)-(n-methylisonicotinylamido)-13,15-cycloimide mesochlorin p(6) methyl ester  () possess high cancer cell killing photodynamic activity, but they provide no photoinduced bactericidal effect. substitution of an ethyl group with a hydroxyethyl or acetyl group at position 3 of the macrocycle results in a decrease in extinction and intracellular accumulation that finally leads to the reduced photocytotoxicity. cationic cicd are targeted to lysosomes, and their intracellular penetration occurs most probably via caveolae-dependent endocytosis. photodynamic treatment with cationic cicd results in the cell death  via necrosis at both sub-phototoxic (40-70% of dead cells) and phototoxic (90-100% of dead cells) regimes of cell treatment. irradiation induces lysosome damage, leakage of cicd from lysosomes and development of protease activity in cytoplasm, whereas mitochondria are not affected with irradiation. a positive charge of cationic cicd modified drastically an internalization pathway, sites of intracellular localization and mechanisms of photoinduced cytotoxicity as compared to previously studied neutral and anionic cicd. our experiments with different cicd show that varying charge and structure of substituents it is possible to modulate many cellular properties of cicd in order to find the best molecular template of the advanced near-ir photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy.

AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in the common seawhip, leptogorgia virgulata (cnidaria: gorgonaceae).
AB  == antimicrobial activity was examined in the gorgonian leptogorgia virgulata (common seawhip) from south carolina waters. extraction and assay protocols were  developed to identify antimicrobial activity in crude extracts of l. virgulata. detection was determined by liquid growth inhibition assays using escherichia coli bl21, vibrio harveyii, micrococcus luteus, and a bacillus sp. isolate. this  represents the first report of antimicrobial activity in l. virgulata, a temperate/sub-tropical coral of the western atlantic ocean. results from growth inhibition assays guided a fractionation scheme to identify active compounds. reverse-phase hplc, hplc-mass spectrometry, and 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy were  used to isolate, purify, and characterize metabolites in antimicrobial fractions  of l. virgulata. corroborative hplc-ms/nmr evidence validated the presence of homarine and a homarine analog, well-known emetic metabolites previously isolated from l. virgulata, in coral extracts. in subsequent assays, partially-purified l. virgulata fractions collected from hplc-ms fractionation were shown to contain antimicrobial activity using m. luteus and v. harveyii. this study provides evidence that homarine is an active constituent of the innate immune system in l. virgulata. we speculate it may act synergistically with cofactors and/or congeners in this octocoral to mount a response to microbial invasion and disease.

TI  == a combined mass spectrometric and cdna sequencing approach to the isolation and characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea.
AB  == studies conducted on amphibian skin secretions over the past 40 years have isolated and identified huge arrays of bioactive peptides, many of which have demonstrated potent anti-microbial activity. such peptides are attracting increasing attention due to the growing problem of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to conventional antibiotics. the current study utilized a combined proteomic/genomic approach to facilitate the high throughput sequencing of five novel dermaseptins and four novel phylloseptins from the skin secretions of phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea. peptides were partially identified using q-tof ms/ms fragmentation and de novo sequencing, while a cdna library was constructed from the lyophilized skin secretion. 3'-race reactions used primers designed for the highly conserved 5'-signal regions of previously deduced dermaseptin precursors. cdna sequenced peptides were attributed to their respective fragmentation spectra to confirm the structure of the final processed  peptides. such an approach identified post-translational modifications in addition to deciphering isobaric amino acids. several of the peptides were purified to homogeneity and displayed potent antimicrobial activity with minimum  inhibitory concentrations starting at 0.4 microm when tested against and range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus.

TI  == immune upregulation of novel antibacterial proteins from silkmoths (lepidoptera)  that resemble lysozymes but lack muramidase activity.
AB  == study on immune proteins in domesticated and wild silkmoths bombyx mori and antheraea mylitta, respectively, led to identification of a new class of antimicrobial proteins. we designated them as lysozyme-like proteins (llps) owing to their partial similarity with lysozymes. however, lack of characteristic catalytic amino acid residues essential for muramidase activity in llps puts them functionally apart from classical lysozymes. two llps, one from b. mori (bllp1) and the other from a. mylitta (allp1) expressed in a recombinant system, exhibited a broad-spectrum antibacterial action. further investigation of the antibacterial mechanism revealed that bllp1 is bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus. substantial increase in hemolymph bacterial load was observed in b. mori upon rna interference mediated in vivo knockdown of bllp1. we demonstrate that the antibacterial mechanism of this protein depends on peptidoglycan binding unlike peptidoglycan hydrolysis or membrane permeabilization as observed with lysozymes  and most other antimicrobial peptides. to our knowledge, this is the first report on functional analysis of novel, non-catalytic lysozyme-like family of antibacterial proteins that are quite apart functionally from classical lysozymes. the present analysis holds promise for functional annotation of similar proteins from other organisms.

TI  == protein kinase a activity and protein phosphorylation in the haemocytes of immune-challenged galleria mellonella larvae.
AB  == protein kinase a (pka) activity was detected in the haemocytes of greater wax moth, galleria mellonella larvae using a specific peptide substrate--kemptide. the enzyme was activated in vitro by 1 microm concentration of camp, 8-br-camp, 8-chl-camp and bzcmp, whereas in the case of cgmp 10 microm concentration was necessary. immune challenge of g. mellonella larvae with bacteria led to changes  in haemocyte pka activity. gram-positive m. luteus was a better inducer of pka activity than gram-negative e. coli. the kinetics of activity changes was dependent on the bacteria used and considerably differed from that observed in water-treated insects. inhibition of pka activity by cell-permeable, specific inhibitor, rp-8-br-camps, induced changes in haemocyte morphology resembling those caused by live bacteria. four potential pka substrates of 155 kda, 44 kda,  40 kda and 22 kda were recognized in the haemocytes of naive larvae by phospho-motif antibodies for pka phosphorylation consensus site. the modification level of 40 kda protein changed after water treatment and immune challenge of g.  mellonella larvae, whereas that of 155 kda protein changed only after e. coli and lps injections. additionally, in the haemocytes of bacteria- and lps-challenged insects a transient phosphorylation of 36 kda protein was detected.

TI  == ecological variables affecting predatory success in myxococcus xanthus.
AB  == the feeding efficiency of microbial predators depends on both the availability of various prey species and abiotic variables. myxococcus xanthus is a bacterial predator that searches for microbial prey by gliding motility, and then kills and lyses its prey with secreted compounds. we manipulated three ecological variables to examine their effects on the predatory performance of m. xanthus to better understand its behavior and how it affects prey populations. experiments were designed to determine how surface solidity (hard vs soft agar), density of prey patches (1 vs 2 cm grids), and type of prey (gram-positive micrococcus luteus vs  gram-negative escherichia coli) affect predatory swarming and prey killing by m.  xanthus. the prey were dispersed in patches on a buffered agar surface. m. xanthus swarms attacked a greater proportion of prey patches when patches were densely arranged on a hard-agar surface, compared with either soft-agar surfaces  or low-patch-density arrangements. these ecological variables did not significantly influence the rate of killing of individual prey within a patch, although a few surviving prey were more likely to be recovered on soft agar than  on hard agar. these results indicate that m. xanthus quickly kills most nearby e. coli or m. luteus regardless of the surface. however, the ability of m. xanthus to search out patches of these prey is affected by surface hardness, the density  of prey patches, and the prey species.

TI  == proteolytic activation of pro-spatzle is required for the induced transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes in lepidopteran insects.
AB  == microbial infection leads to proteolytic activation of drosophila spatzle, which  binds to the toll receptor and induces the synthesis of immune proteins. to test  whether or not this mechanism exists in lepidopteran insects, we cloned the cdna  of bombyx mori spatzle-1 and overexpressed the full-length and truncated bmspz1 cdna in escherichia coli. the insoluble fusion proteins were affinity-purified under denaturing condition. after the silkworm larvae were injected with renatured bmspz1, mrna levels of antimicrobial peptide genes greatly increased. similar transcriptional up-regulation was also found in manduca sexta. injection  of pro-bmspz1 had no such effect. when pro-bmspz1 and micrococcus luteus were incubated with the plasma from m. sexta larvae, we detected proteolytic processing of pro-bmspz1. these results suggest that active spatzle is required for the induced production of antimicrobial peptides in b. mori and m. sexta.

AB  == objectives: to measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. methods: three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles  were synthesized containing c13 to c22 fatty chains. susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mycobacterium smegmatis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the mic. results: several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against mrsa (mic =  36 mg/l), c. albicans (mic = 4.4 mg/l), s. cerevisiae (mic = 1.1 mg/l) and m. smegmatis (mic = 8.9 mg/l). these amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. alkyl chain length influenced the values of mic; longer chains (c18-c22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. conclusions: as the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.

TI  == ird1 is a vps15 homologue important for antibacterial immune responses in drosophila.
AB  == the immune response-deficient 1 (ird1) gene was identified in a forward genetic screen as a novel regulator for the activation of imd nfkappab immune signalling  pathway in drosophila. ird1 animals are also more susceptible to escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus bacterial infection. ird1 encodes the drosophila homologue of the vps15/p150 serine/threonine kinase that regulates a class iii phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is necessary for phagosome maturation and starvation-induced autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells. to gain insight into the role of ird1 in the immune response, we examine how amino acid starvation affects the immune signalling pathways in drosophila. starvation, in the absence  of infection, leads to expression of antimicrobial peptide (amp) genes and this response is dependent on ird1 and the imd immune signalling pathway. starvation,  in addition to bacterial infection, suppresses the amp response in wild-type animals and reduces the ability to survive m. luteus infection. our results suggest that starvation and innate immune signalling may be intimately linked processes.

AB  == we have isolated a 417da antibacterial molecule, named mygalin, from the hemocytes of the spider acanthoscurria gomesiana. the structure of mygalin was elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) and by two spectroscopic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy. mygalin was identified as bis-acylpolyamine n1,n8-bis(2,5-dihydroxybenzoyl)spermidine, in which the primary amino groups of the spermidine are acylated with the carboxyl group of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. mygalin was active against escherichia coli at 85mum, being this activity inhibited completely by catalase. therefore, the antibacterial activity of mygalin was attributed to its production of hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)). the putative mechanisms of formation of h(2)o(2) from mygalin are discussed. to our knowledge this is the first report of one bis-acylpolyamine with antibacterial activity purified from animal source.

TI  == silica xerogel-hydrogen peroxide composites: their morphology, stability, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide was incorporated into silica xerogel matrix over the concentration range from 3.8 to 68.0 wt% via the sol-gel route. the obtained composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and differential scanning calorimetry (dsc). the release rates of h(2)o(2) from the composites into the aqueous phase were examined. in most cases, a 90% release was attained after ca. 10 min, and it was only slightly dependent on h(2)o(2) concentration and particle size. the antimicrobial activity of the composite containing 3.59% h(2)o(2) was evaluated against escherichia coli and micrococcus  luteus. a comparative assay was carried out for aqueous solution of h(2)o(2) of the same concentration. the results demonstrated a potent microbicidal efficacy of the composite. furthermore, diffusion range of the hydrogen peroxide from the  solid composite into an agar medium matched that of the h(2)o(2) in aqueous solution. the stability tests with the xerogels containing 3.8, 26.4, and 68.0% of h(2)o(2) showed that after 63 days respective losses of the h(2)o(2) at 3 degrees c were 8.8, 9.7, and 6.2%. both the dsc results and the stability tests have shown that the molecular water present in the pores stabilizes the composite, probably through improving the binding of the h(2)o(2) molecules onto  the silica surface.

TI  == molecular cloning and mrna expression of peptidoglycan recognition protein (pgrp) gene in bay scallop (argopecten irradians, lamarck 1819).
AB  == peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps) are a type of pattern recognition molecules (prm) that recognize the unique cell wall component peptidoglycan (pgn) of bacteria and are involved in innate immunity. the first bivalve pgrp cdna sequence was cloned from bay scallop argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (est) and pcr technique. the full-length cdna of bay scallop pgrp (designated aipgrp) gene contained 1018bp with a 615-bp open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 205 amino acids. the predicted amino acid sequence of aipgrp shared high identity with pgrp in other organisms, such as pgrp precursor in trichoplusia ni and pgrp sc2 in drosophila melanogaster. a quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) assay was developed to assess the mrna expression of aipgrp in different tissues and the temporal expression of aipgrp in the mixed primary cultured hemocytes challenged by microbial components lipopolyssacharide (lps) from escherichia coli and pgn from micrococcus luteus. higher-level mrna expression of aipgrp was detected in the tissues of hemocytes,  gonad and kidney. the expression of aipgrp in the mixed primary cultured hemocytes was up regulated after stimulated by pgn, while lps from e. coli did not induce aipgrp expression. the results indicated that aipgrp was a constitutive and inducible expressed protein that was mainly induced by pgn and could be involved in scallop immune response against gram-positive bacteria infection.

TI  == proteome modifications of the medicinal leech nervous system under bacterial challenge.
AB  == once considered as lacking intrinsic immune mechanisms, the cns of vertebrates is now known to be capable of mounting its own innate immune response. interestingly, while invertebrates have been very useful in the interpretation of general vertebrate innate immunity mechanisms, only scarce data are available on  the immune response of nervous tissue within this group. this study provides new  data on the innate immune response of medicinal leech hirudo medicinalis cns. we  identified several spots in 2-d gels of leech cns proteins that showed specific changes following bacterial challenge, thus demonstrating the ability of the leech nervous system to mount a response to an immune stress. protein identifications were based on comparison of sequence data with publicly available databases and a recently established leech ests database. the broad nature of the identified proteins suggests a clear involvement of cytoskeletal rearrangements,  endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulation of synaptic activity and calcium mobilization, all during the first 24 hours of this response. moreover, several of these proteins are specifically expressed in glial cells, suggesting an important role for glial cells in the immune response of the leech nervous system, similar to what has been observed in vertebrates.

TI  == structure-activity relationships in nitrothiophenes.
AB  == the structure and electronic properties of a series of biologically active 2-nitrothiophenes (1) have been calculated using both semi-empirical and ab initio molecular orbital methods. multi-linear regression analysis suggests that  there is a reasonable correlation between the experimental activity of the derivatives against either escherichia coli or micrococcus luteus and calculated  properties such as the homo energies, the total atomic charges and ring angles at the heterocyclic sulfur atom, but there is no correlation with the calculated solvation energies or dipole moments. the presence or absence of an additional nitro group at the 3-position of the ring also has a significant effect on the activity. from the derived qsar equations, the 2-chloro- or 2-bromo-3,5-dinitrothiophenes (1a and 1c) are predicted to show the highest activity against both bacteria, while 2-nitrothiophene (1n) is predicted to be the least active, in line with the experimental results.

TI  == analysis of bacteria-challenged wild silkmoth, antheraea mylitta (lepidoptera) transcriptome reveals potential immune genes.
AB  == background: in the recent years a strong resemblance has been observed between the insect immune system and the mammalian innate immune mechanisms suggesting their common origin. among the insects, only the dipterans (drosophila and various mosquito species) have been widely investigated for their immune responses towards diverse pathogens. in the present study we constructed and analysed the immune transcriptome of the lepidopteran antheraea mylitta, an economically important indian tasar silkmoth with a view to unravel the potential immune-related genes and pathways. results: an expressed sequence tag (est) library was constructed from mrna obtained from fat bodies of a. mylitta larvae that had been challenged by infection with escherichia coli cells. we identified  719 unique ests from a total of 1412 sequences so generated. a third of the transcriptome showed similarity with previously characterized immune-related genes that included both the known and putative immune genes. of the four putative novel defence proteins (dfps) annotated by psi-blast three showed similarity to extracellular matrix proteins from vertebrates implicated in innate immunity, while the fourth was similar to, yet distinct from, the anti-microbial  protein cecropin. finally, we analysed the expression profiles of 15 potential immune-related genes, and the majority of them were induced more prominently with e. coli compared to micrococcus luteus. we also identified several unknown proteins, some of which could have probable immune-related functions based on the results of the prodom analysis. conclusion: the present study has identified many potential immune-related genes in a. mylitta some of which are vertebrate homologues and others are hitherto unreported putative defence proteins. several  genes were present as members of gene families, as has also been observed in other insect species.

TI  == dnase ii deficiency impairs innate immune function in drosophila.
AB  == dnase ii enzymes are highly conserved proteins that are required for the degradation of dna within phagolysosomes. engulfment of apoptotic cells and/or bacteria by phagocytic cells requires the function of dnase ii to completely destroy ingested dna. mutation of the dnase ii gene results in an increase of undegraded apoptotic dna within phagocytic cells in mice and nematodes. additionally, reduction of dnase ii enzymatic activity in drosophila melanogaster has been shown to lead to increased accumulation of dna in the ovaries. due to the importance of dna clearance during infection, we hypothesized that a severe reduction of dnase ii activity would result in diminished immune function and viability. to test this hypothesis, we knocked down dnase ii activity in flies using rnai. as expected, expression of a dnase ii-rnai construct in flies resulted in a dramatic reduction of dnase ii activity and a significant decrease  in total hemocyte numbers. furthermore, infection of dnase ii-rnai flies with gram negative or positive bacteria resulted in a severe reduction in fly viability. these results confirm that dnase ii and the ability to clear macromolecular dna is essential for maintaining proper immune function in drosophila.

TI  == bacterial inactivation using a low-temperature atmospheric plasma brush sustained with argon gas.
AB  == this study investigated the bacterial inactivation/sterilization effects of a new atmospheric plasma source, which is a brush-shaped argon glow discharge created under 1 atm pressure. such an atmospheric plasma brush requires extremely low power of less than 20 w to operate; and therefore is essentially a low-temperature discharge as confirmed by gas-phase temperature measurements. two bacteria, escherichia coli (e. coli) and micrococcus luteus (m. luteus), seeded in various media were subjected to plasma treatment and their survivability was examined. it was found that such argon atmospheric plasma brush is very effective in destruction of the bacteria cells. with nutrient broth and standard methods agar as supporting media, a cell reduction in a level of 6 orders of magnitude was observed for e. coli within 3-4 min plasma treatment. a similar level of cell reduction was also observed for m. luteus in the two media with 2 or 3 min plasma treatment. the plasma treatment effects on the bacteria cell structures were also examined using scanning electron microscopy and the cell structure damages due to the plasma exposure were observed on both bacteria. the possible sterilization mechanism of the argon plasmas is also discussed in this article.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a novel c-type lectin from zhikong scallop chlamys farreri.
AB  == c-type lectin is a family of ca2+ dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play crucial roles in the innate immunity of invertebrates by mediating the recognition of host cells to pathogens and clearing microinvaders as a pattern recognition protein (prp). the cdna of zhikong scallop chlamys farreri c-type lectin (designated cflec-1) was cloned by expressed sequence tag (est) and race techniques. the full-length cdna of cflec-1 was 1785 bp, consisting of a 5'-terminal untranslated region (utr) of 66 bp and an unusually long 3' utr of 1040 bp with seven polyadenylation signal sequences aataaa and a poly(a) tail. the cflec-1 cdna encoded a polypeptide of 221 amino acids with a putative signal  peptide of 15 amino acid residues and a mature protein of 206 amino acids. analysis of the protein domain features indicated a typical long-form carbohydrate-recognition domain (crd) of 130 residues in the cflec-1 deduced amino acid sequence. the expression pattern of cflec-1 transcripts in healthy and bacterial challenged scallops was studied by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. mrna transcripts of cflec-1 could be mainly detected in the tissues of haemocytes, gill, gonad and mantle of unchallenged scallops, whereas the expression of cflec-1 transcripts was increased in all the tested tissues after heat-killed vibrio anguillarum challenge. the temporal expression of cflec-1 mrna in haemolymph challenged by micrococcus luteus and v. anguillarum was both up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 8 and 16 h post stimulation, respectively, and then dropped back to the original level. in order to investigate its immune functions, cflec-1 was recombined and expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3)-plyss as a fusion protein with thioredoxin. the recombinant cflec-1 agglutinated bacteria e. coli jm109 in vitro, and the agglutination was ca2+ dependent which could be inhibited by edta. but it did not agglutinate m. luteus, candida lipolytica and animal erythrocytes including rabbit, rat, mouse, chicken, human group a, human group b, human group o. meanwhile, the recombinant cflec-1 could inhibit the growth of both e. coli jm109 and m. luteus, but no inhibition activity against v. anguillarum. these result indicated that cflec-1 was a constitutive and inducible prp which was involved in the reorganization and clearance of invaders in scallop.

TI  == dna buoyant density shifts during 15n-dna stable isotope probing.
AB  == dna-based stable isotope probing (sip) is a novel technique for the identification of organisms actively assimilating isotopically labeled compounds. herein, we define the limitations to using 15n-labeled substrates for sip and propose modifications to compensate for these shortcomings. changes in dna buoyant density (bd) resulting from 15n incorporation were determined using cultures of disparate gc content (escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus). incorporation of 15n into dna increased bd by 0.015+/-0.002 g ml(-1) for e. coli  and 0.013+/-0.002 g ml(-1) for m. luteus. the dna bd shift was greatly increased  (0.045 g ml(-1)) when dual isotope (13c plus 15n) labeling was employed. despite  the limited dna bd shift following 15n enrichment, we found the use of gradient fractionation, followed by a comparison of t-rflp profiles from fractions of labeled and control treatments, facilitated detection of enrichment in dna samples from either cultures or soil.

TI  == rapid high-throughput assessment of aerobic bacteria in complex samples by fluorescence-based oxygen respirometry.
AB  == a simple method has been developed for the analysis of aerobic bacteria in complex samples such as broth and food homogenates. it employs commercial phosphorescent oxygen-sensitive probes to monitor oxygen consumption of samples containing bacteria using standard microtiter plates and fluorescence plate readers. as bacteria grow in aqueous medium, at certain points they begin to deplete dissolved oxygen, which is seen as an increase in probe fluorescence above baseline signal. the time required to reach threshold signal is used to either enumerate bacteria based on a predetermined calibration or to assess the effects of various effectors on the growth of test bacteria by comparison with an untreated control. this method allows for the sensitive (down to a single cell),  rapid (0.5 to 12 h) enumeration of aerobic bacteria without the need to conduct lengthy (48 to 72 h) and tedious colony counts on agar plates. it also allows for screening a wide range of chemical and environmental samples for their toxicity.  these assays have been validated with different bacteria, including escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, and pseudomonas fluorescens, with the enumeration of total viable counts in broth and industrial food samples (packaged ham, chicken,  and mince meat), and comparison with established agar plating and optical-density-at-600-nm assays has been given.

TI  == muralytic activity of micrococcus luteus rpf and its relationship to physiological activity in promoting bacterial growth and resuscitation.
AB  == the culturability of several actinobacteria is controlled by resuscitation-promoting factors (rpfs). these are proteins containing a c. 70-residue domain that adopts a lysozyme-like fold. the invariant catalytic glutamate residue found in lysozyme and various bacterial lytic transglycosylases is also conserved in the rpf proteins. rpf from micrococcus luteus, the founder member of this protein family, is indeed a muralytic enzyme, as revealed by its activity in zymograms containing m. luteus cell walls and its ability to (i) cause lysis of escherichia coli when expressed and secreted into the periplasm; (ii) release fluorescent material from fluorescamine-labelled cell walls of m. luteus; and (iii) hydrolyse the artificial lysozyme substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-n,n',n''-triacetylchitotrioside. rpf activity was reduced but not completely abolished when the invariant glutamate residue was altered. moreover, none of the other acidic residues in the rpf domain was absolutely required for muralytic activity. replacement of one or both of the cysteine residues that probably form a disulphide bridge within rpf impaired but  did not completely abolish muralytic activity. the muralytic activities of the rpf mutants were correlated with their abilities to stimulate bacterial culturability and resuscitation, consistent with the view that the biological activity of rpf results directly or indirectly from its ability to cleave bonds in bacterial peptidoglycan.

TI  == multiarray sensors with pattern recognition for the detection, classification, and differentiation of bacteria at subspecies and strain levels.
AB  == this work describes the integration of a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor with pattern recognition techniques for the detection and classification of bacteria at subspecies and strain level. the system provides a  continuous, real-time monitoring of bacteria activity upon exposure to antibiotics. the system utilizes 96-well-type electrodes array (dox-dissolved oxygen sensor) with principal component analysis (pca) for rapid and routine classification of different classes of bacteria and related strains. a representative sample of a section of the bacteria kingdom has been analyzed and  classified using the proposed dox-pca system, including the following: corynebacterium glutamicum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus epidermidis, yersinia ruckeri, escherichia adecarboxylata, comamonas acidovorans, alcaligenes  odorans, bacillus globigii, and three strains of escherichia coli (k12, sm10, atcc 25922). the new classification scheme is based on the hypothesis that, under identical experimental conditions, various bacteria consume oxygen at different rates and are affected in different ways by selected antibiotics. thus, the response of the individual electrode in the array is indirectly altered, compared to that of cells growing on medium, by the addition of the antibiotic. by using three different antibiotics in separate wells, a unique fingerprint can be created for a specific bacterium. with the proposed dox-pca system, classification of bacteria was achieved at subspecies and strain level in real time. this study represents a basic research tool that may allow researchers to rapidly detect, quantify, and classify bacteria type at subspecies and strain levels.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == peptidoglycan recognition by the drosophila imd pathway.
AB  == the structural requirements for recognition of peptidoglycan (pgn) by pgrp-lc and activation of the drosophila imd pathway are not yet clear. in order to examine this question more carefully, the activity of peptidoglycan from different types  of bacteria was compared in cell-based and whole animal assays. drosophila s2* cells, but not adult flies, responded to lys-type micrococcus luteus pgn, but with significantly less potency compared to dap-type escherichia coli pgn, while  intact lys-type pgn from staphylococcus aureus was inactive. after treatment with lysostaphin, which digests the cross-bridging peptides, s. aureus pgn weakly stimulated the imd pathway, similar to m. luteus pgn. further digestion with mutanolysin, which creates monomeric pgn fragments, abolished the activity of s.  aureus pgn. on the other hand, monomeric e. coli pgn, generated by mutanolysin digestion, was still active but required different isoforms of pgrp-lc for recognition. polymeric pgn required only pgrp-lcx, while monomeric e. coli pgn required both the pgrp-lca and pgrp-lcx isoforms. these results suggest that the  recognition by pgrp-lcx alone requires polymeric pgn, and that polymeric dap-type pgn is a more potent pgrp-lcx agonist, compared to lys-type pgn. these results also suggest that the heteromeric pgrp-lca/lcx receptor complex recognizes monomeric dap-type, but not lys-type, pgn.

TI  == immune challenge differentially affects transcript abundance of three antimicrobial peptides in hemocytes from the moth pseudoplusia includens.
AB  == inducible expression of antimicrobial peptides and other humoral immune factors by the insect fat body is well documented. hemocytes comprise the second essential arm of the insect immune system but it is unclear whether antimicrobial peptide genes are expressed by all or only some types of hemocytes. here we report the cloning of cecropin a (pi-ceca), lebocin (pi-leb) and lysozyme (pi-lys) homologs from the moth pseudoplusia includens. relative-quantitative real-time pcr (rq-rtpcr) indicated that transcript abundance for each antimicrobial gene increased in fat body and hemocytes following immune challenge with the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. relative transcript abundance  of pi-ceca was much higher in fat body than hemocytes. in contrast, transcript levels of pi-leb were three-fold lower in hemocytes than fat body while transcript levels of pi-lys were three-fold higher. estimates for the overall contribution of the fat body and hemocytes to antimicrobial peptide expression suggested that hemocytes contribute significantly to pi-lys transcript levels in  larvae but produce much smaller amounts of pi-ceca and pi-leb compared to the fat body. each antimicrobial peptide was also inducibly expressed in hemocytes following challenge with the gram-positive bacterium micrococcus luteus or when hemocytes formed capsules around chromatography beads. analysis of hemocyte types indicated that granulocytes and plasmatocytes expressed all three antimicrobial peptides, whereas spherule cells and oenocytoids expressed only lysozyme. transcriptional profiles of these antimicrobial genes were similar in granulocytes and plasmatocytes in vivo but were very different in vitro.

TI  == antibacterial activity of bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage endolysin without holin conjugation.
AB  == to characterize the enzymatic activity and antibacterial activity of endolysin encoded by a bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage, the open reading frame encoding endolysin was amplified by pcr and cloned into the expression plasmid pet21d(+).  the resultant plasmid was used to transform escherichia coli jm109(de3). production of endolysin in the cytosol facilitated cell lysis without coproduction of holin, which is considered to degrade or alter the cytoplasmic membrane. the phage endolysin was overexpressed and purified. although the specific activity of the purified phage endolysin towards lyophilized micrococcus luteus cells was 1/11 of the activity of chicken egg white lysozymes, the endolysin showed stronger antibacterial activity towards e. coli w3110, e. coli jm109(de3) and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 than chicken egg white lysozymes. the  antibacterial activity of the endolysin towards these three bacterial strains was marked when edta was added to the endolysin solution.

TI  == ixodidin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the hemocytes of the cattle tick boophilus microplus with inhibitory activity against serine proteinases.
AB  == the presence of an effective immune response in the hemocoel of arthropods is essential for survival as it prevents the invasion of pathogens throughout the animal body. antimicrobial peptides (amps) play an important role in this response by rapidly killing invading microorganisms. in this study, a novel cysteine-rich amp has been isolated and characterized from the hemocytes of the cattle tick, boophilus microplus. in addition to growth inhibition of escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus, the newly described amp, designated ixodidin (derived from the family ixodidae), was found to exert proteolytic inhibitory activity against two exogenous serine proteinases, elastase and chymotrypsin. this is the first report of a molecule of an arachnid that has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth and proteinase activity.

TI  == the molecular basis for the mode of action of bicyclomycin.
AB  == bicyclomycin (1) is a clinically useful antibiotic exhibiting activity against a  broad spectrum of gram-negative bacteria and against the gram-positive bacterium, micrococcus luteus. bicyclomycin has been used to treat diarrhea in humans and bacterial diarrhea in calves and pigs and is marketed by fujisawa (osaka, japan)  under the trade name bicozamycin. the structure of 1 is unique among antibiotics, and our studies document that its mechanism of action is novel. early mechanistic proposals suggested that 1 reacted with nucleophiles (e.g., a protein sulfhydryl  group) necessary for the remodeling the peptidoglycan assembly within the bacterial cell wall. we, however, showed that 1 targeted the rho transcription termination factor in escherichia coli. the rho protein is integral to the expression of many gene products in e. coli and other gram-negative bacteria, and without rho the cell losses viability. rho is a member of the reca-type atpase class of enzymes that use nucleotide contacts to couple oligonucleotide translocation to atp hydrolysis. bicyclomycin is the only known selective inhibitor of rho. in this article, we integrate the evidence obtained from bicyclomycin structure-activity studies, site-directed mutagenesis investigations, bicyclomycin affinity labels, and biochemical and biophysical measurements with recent x-ray crystallographic images of the bicyclomycin-rho complex to define the rho antibiotic binding site and to document the pathway for rho inhibition by 1. together, the structural and functional studies demonstrate  how 1, a modest rho inhibitor, can disrupt the rho molecular machinery thereby leading to a catastrophic effect caused by the untimely overproduction of proteins not normally expressed constitutively, thus leading to a toxic effect on the cells.

TI  == host blood proteins and peptides in the midgut of the tick dermacentor variabilis contribute to bacterial control.
AB  == antimicrobial midgut proteins and peptides that result from blood digestion in feeding american dog ticks dermacentor variabilis (say) were identified. midgut extracts from these ticks showed antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus, regardless of whether they were challenged with peptidoglycan, blood meal components, rabbit blood, bacillus subtilis, escherischia coli or borrelia burgdorferi. however, no peptide band co-migrating with defensin was found in midgut extracts from the challenged ticks. partial purification of the midgut extracts using c(18) sep paks and gel electrophoresis showed the presence of 4 distinct bands with rmw 4.1, 5.3, 5.7 and 8.0 kda identified by tryptic digestion-mass fingerprinting as digestive fragments of rabbit alpha-, beta-, gamma-chain hemoglobin, and rabbit ubiquitin. no evidence of varisin, a defensin  previously identified in the hemolymph of d. variabilis, was found in the tryptic digest, although varisin was found in a hemocyte lysate using the same methods. however, varisin transcript was detected in midgut cell lysates. also present in  all midgut samples was a cluster of 3 overlapping bands with rmw 13.0, 14.1 and 14.7 kda which were identified by tryptic-digestion lc-ms and maldi-tof as rabbit alpha- and beta-chain hemoglobin (undigested) and transtherytin. lysozyme transcript was detected in midgut cell extracts but the peptide was not. studies  done on other tick species demonstrated that hemoglobin digestion resulted in antimicrobial fragments. antimicrobial hemoglobin fragments (including fragments  larger than any reported previously) also were found in d. variabilis, as well as ubiquitin, a peptide known to occur as part of an antimicrobial complex in vertebrate leukocytes. in addition, we noted that borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes were not lysed in the midgut lumen, which would be expected if defensin and lysozyme were active in this location. in this respect, the midgut's response to microbial challenge differs from that of the hemolymph. in summary, the midgut's antimicrobial activity appears to be primarily a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion rather than expression of immune peptides and proteins.

TI  == mosquito phenoloxidase and defensin colocalize in melanization innate immune responses.
AB  == mosquitoes mount strong humoral and cellular immune responses against foreign organisms. two components of the mosquito immune response that have received much attention are the phenoloxidase cascade that leads to melanization and antimicrobial peptides. the purpose of the current study was to use immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy to identify the location of the melanization rate-limiting enzyme phenoloxidase and the antimicrobial peptide defensin in innate immune reactions against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus by the mosquito aedes aegypti. our results show that both phenoloxidase and defensin are present at the sites of melanin biosynthesis in immune reactions against bacteria. furthermore, both proteins are often present inside the same melanotic capsules. when hemocytes were analyzed, phenoloxidase was present in the cytosol of oenocytoids, but no significant amounts of defensin were detected inside any hemocytes. in summary, these data show that phenoloxidase and defensin colocalize in melanization reactions against bacteria  and argue for further studies into the potential role of defensin in phenoloxidase-based melanization innate immune responses in mosquitoes.

TI  == aging of the innate immune response in drosophila melanogaster.
AB  == increased activation of the innate immune system is a common feature of aging animals, including mammals and drosophila melanogaster. with age, d. melanogaster progressively express higher levels of many antimicrobial peptides. it is unknown, however, whether this pattern reflects age-dependent changes in the function of the immune system itself or arises simply because aged adults have greater cumulative exposure to pathogens. here we demonstrate that aged d. melanogaster transcribe more antimicrobial diptericin when experimentally exposed to septic bacterial infections. this strong net response in older females is the  result of persistent diptericin transcription upon septic exposure, whereas young females rapidly terminate this induction. in contrast to their response to septic exposure, when exposed to killed bacteria aged females have less capacity to induce diptericin. because this functional capacity of innate immunity declines with age, we conclude that female drosophila undergo immune senescence. furthermore, we show that fecundity is reduced by induction of innate immunity via the immune deficiency pathway. consequently, maximum reproduction will occur  when the immune response is tightly controlled in young females, even if this increases infection risk at later ages.

AB  == the ethyl acetate extract of the whole aerial parts of varthemia iphionoides (compositae) showed a pronounced antibacterial activity. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract and further purification of the most antibacterially active fraction led to the isolation and identification of an antibacterial sesquiterpene, selina-4,11(13)-dien-3-on-12-oic acid. this compound exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against six bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli,  bacillus cereus and salmonella enteritides). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of this compound which was determined by the agar dilution  method ranged between 250 and 500 microg/ml.

TI  == identification of a novel peptidoglycan hydrolase cwlm in mycobacterium tuberculosis.
AB  == mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major global pathogen whose threat has increased  with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. the cell wall of m. tuberculosis is thick, rigid, and hydrophobic, which serves to protect the organism from the environment and makes it highly impermeable to conventional antimicrobial agents. there is little known about cell wall autolysins (also referred to as peptidoglycan hydrolases) of mycobacteria. we identified an open reading frame (rv3915) in the m. tuberculosis genome designated cwlm that appeared consistent with a peptidoglycan hydrolase. the 1218-bp gene was amplified by pcr, cloned and expressed in e. coli strain hms174(de-3), and its gene product, a 47-kda recombinant protein, was purified and partially characterized. purified cwlm was able to lyse whole mycobacteria, release peptidoglycan from the cell wall of micrococcus luteus and mycobacterium smegmatis, and cleave n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine, releasing free n-acetylmuramic acid. these results indicate that cwlm is a novel autolysin and identify cwlm as the first, to our knowledge, autolysin gene identified and cloned from m. tuberculosis. cwlm offers a new target for a unique class of drugs that could alter the permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall and enhance the  effectiveness of treatments for tuberculosis.

TI  == new insights into drosophila larval haemocyte functions through genome-wide analysis.
AB  == drosophila blood cells or haemocytes comprise three cell lineages, plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes, involved in immune functions such as phagocytosis, melanisation and encapsulation. transcriptional profiling of activities of distinct haemocyte populations and from naive or infected larvae, was performed to find genes contributing to haemocyte functions. of the 13 000 genes represented on the microarray, over 2500 exhibited significantly enriched transcription in haemocytes. among these were genes encoding integrins, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps), scavenger receptors, lectins, cell adhesion molecules and serine proteases. one relevant outcome of this analysis was the gain of new insights into the lamellocyte encapsulation process. we showed that lamellocytes require betaps integrin for encapsulation and that they  transcribe one prophenoloxidase gene enabling them to produce the enzyme necessary for melanisation of the capsule. a second compelling observation was that following infection, the gene encoding the cytokine spatzle was uniquely upregulated in haemocytes and not the fat body. this shows that drosophila haemocytes produce a signal molecule ready to be activated through cleavage after pathogen recognition, informing distant tissues of infection.

TI  == mosquito innate immunity: involvement of beta 1,3-glucan recognition protein in melanotic encapsulation immune responses in armigeres subalbatus.
AB  == beta 1,3-glucan recognition proteins (grp) have specific affinity for beta 1,3-glucan, a component on the surface of fungi and bacteria. by interacting with beta 1,3-glucan, grp initiates activation of prophenoloxidase, a key enzyme in the signaling pathway leading to melanotic encapsulation in invertebrates. in this study, we characterize a novel hemocyte-specific grp from the mosquito, armigeres subalbatus (asgrp). the 1.57 kb cdna clone encodes a 499 deduced amino  acid sequence, which contains a region that displays significant similarity to the glucanase-like regions of other grps and gram-negative bacteria binding proteins found in other organisms. asgrp is constitutively expressed in the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes, and is upregulated following challenge with escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, and the filarial worm dirofilaria immitis.  asgrp specifically recognizes curdlan (insoluble beta 1,3-glucan), but not mannose or n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. asgrp binds a low percentage of e. coli, most  m. luteus and d. immitis microfilariae. asgrp double-stranded rna interference strongly inhibits melanotic encapsulation of d. immitis in ar. subalbatus. these  results suggest that asgrp has the capacity to bind to a variety of pathogens, functions as a pattern recognition receptor, and is required for effective melanotic encapsulation immune responses in ar. subalbatus.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == multilayer polyelectrolyte films functionalized by insertion of defensin: a new approach to protection of implants from bacterial colonization.
AB  == infection of implanted materials by bacteria constitutes one of the most serious  complications following prosthetic surgery. in the present study, we developed a  new strategy based on the insertion of an antimicrobial peptide (defensin from anopheles gambiae mosquitoes) into polyelectrolyte multilayer films built by the  alternate deposition of polyanions and polycations. quartz crystal microbalance and streaming potential measurements were used to follow step by step the construction of the multilayer films and embedding of the defensin within the films. antimicrobial assays were performed with two strains: micrococcus luteus (a gram-positive bacterium) and escherichia coli d22 (a gram-negative bacterium). the inhibition of e. coli d22 growth at the surface of defensin-functionalized films was found to be 98% when 10 antimicrobial peptide layers were inserted in the film architecture. noticeably, the biofunctionalization could be achieved only when positively charged poly(l-lysine) was the outermost layer of the film.  on the basis of the results of bacterial adhesion experiments observed by confocal or electron microscopy, these observations could result from the close interaction of the bacteria with the positively charged ends of the films, which  allows defensin to interact with the bacterial membrane structure. these results  open new possibilities for the use of such easily built and functionalized architectures onto any type of implantable biomaterial. the modified surfaces are active against microbial infection and represent a novel means of local host protection.

TI  == microfabricated differential mobility spectrometry with pyrolysis gas chromatography for chemical characterization of bacteria.
AB  == a microfabricated drift tube for differential mobility spectrometry (dms) was used with pyrolysis-gas chromatography (py-gc) to chemically characterize bacteria through three-dimensional plots of ion intensity, compensation voltage from differential mobility spectra, and chromatographic retention time. the dms analyzer provided chemical information for positive and negative ions simultaneously from chemical reactions between pyrolysis products in the gc effluent and reactant ions of h+(h2o)n and o2-(h2o)n in air at ambient pressure.  authentic standards for chemicals formed in the pyrolysis of bacteria showed favorable matches with plots from py-gc/dms analysis and were supported by py-gc/ms results. these and other yet-unidentified constituents provided a means  to distinguish escherichia coli from micrococcus luteus. a gram-positive spore former (bacillus megaterium) was distinguished by an abundant peak for crotonic acid evident in positive and negative ions and not observed with m. luteus. in contrast, plots from py-gc/dms of lipid a and lipoteichoic acid showed poor matches to plots for a gram-negative (e. coli) bacterium and a gram-positive (m.  luteus) bacterium and the differences were attributed to differences in genus sources of the biopolymers. a significant percentage of the chemical information  available in py-gc/dms is unidentified, and the analytical utility must be established. precision in the chemical measurement was determined as +/- 0.2 v, 10% relative standard deviation (rsd), and +/- 0.05 min for compensation voltage, peak intensity, and retention time, respectively. the minimum number of total bacteria (cell forming units) detected was 6000 though detection limits and resolution could be varied by the magnitude of the separation voltage in the differential mobility spectrometer.

TI  == a novel lectin with a fibrinogen-like domain and its potential involvement in the innate immune response of armigeres subalbatus against bacteria.
AB  == mosquitoes have an efficient cellular innate immune response that includes phagocytosis of microbial pathogens and encapsulation of metozoan parasites. in this study, we describe a novel lectin in the mosquito, armigeres subalbatus (aslectin or al-1). the 1.27 kb cdna clone for the al-1 gene (al-1) encodes a 279 deduced amino acid sequence that contains a c-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. al-1 is transcribed in all life stages. al-1 mainly exists in the haemolymph of adult female mosquitoes, and is upregulated following both escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus challenge. al-1 specifically recognizes n-acetyl-d-glucosamine and is able to bind both e. coli and m. luteus. these results suggest that al-1 might function as a pattern recognition receptor in the immune response in ar. subalbatus.

TI  == resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  == background: lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. in this  work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. results: bovine gastric extract  (bge) was active against both g+ and g- bacteria, but the effect against gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified bgl had only activity against gram+ bacteria. we were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the bge, and found that the inhibition of gram negative bacteria by bge was due to an artefact caused by acetate. we report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (bg lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific  resistance of some rumen gram positive strains to bgl. conclusions: some gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == transcriptomic analysis in the leech theromyzon tessulatum: involvement of cystatin b in innate immunity.
AB  == at the present time, there is little information on mechanisms of innate immunity in invertebrate groups other than insects, especially annelids. in the present study, we have performed a transcriptomic study of the immune response in the leech theromyzon tessulatum after bacterial challenge, by a combination of differential display rt (reverse transcriptase)-pcr and cdna microarrays. the results show relevant modulations concerning several known and unknown genes. indeed, threonine deaminase, malate dehydrogenase, cystatin b, polyadenylate-binding protein and alpha-tubulin-like genes are up-regulated after immunostimulation. we focused on cystatin b (stefin b), which is an inhibitor of  cysteine proteinases involved in the vertebrate immune response. we have cloned the full-length cdna and named the t. tessulatum gene as tt-cysb. main structural features of cystatins were identified in the derived amino acid sequence of tt-cysb cdna; namely, a glycine residue in the n-terminus and a consensus sequence of gln-xaa-val-xaa-gly (qxvxg) corresponding to the catalytic site. moreover, tt-cysb is the first cystatin b gene characterized in invertebrates. we have determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry that tt-cysb is  only expressed in large coelomic cells. in addition, this analysis confirmed that tt-cysb is up-regulated after bacterial challenge, and that increased expression  occurs only in coelomic cells. these data demonstrate that the innate immune response in the leech involves a cysteine proteinase inhibitor that is not found  in ecdysozoan models, such as drosophila melanogaster or caenorhabditis elegans,  and so underlines the great need for information about innate immunity mechanisms in different invertebrate groups.

TI  == reassessing the role of defensin in the innate immune response of the mosquito, aedes aegypti.
AB  == defensin is the predominant inducible immune peptide in aedes aegypti. in spite of its activity against gram-positive bacteria in vitro, defensin expression is detected in mosquitoes inoculated with gram-positive or negative bacteria, or with filarial worms. defensin transcription and expression are dependent upon bacterial dose; however, translation is inconsistent with transcription because peptide is detectable only in mosquitoes inoculated with large doses. in vitro translation assays provide further evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of defensin. clearance assays show that a majority of bacteria are cleared before defensin is detected. in gene silencing experiments, no significant difference in mortality was observed between defensin-deficient and control mosquitoes after bacteria inoculation. these studies suggest that defensin may have an alternative function in mosquito immunity.

AB  == we have isolated and characterized a new beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein that is present in manduca sexta cuticle and hemolymph. this 52 kda protein, designated betagrp-2, is 57% identical in sequence to betagrp-1 from larval hymolymph of the same insect. betagrp-2 differs from betagrp-1 in its absence of  the naive larvae before the wandering stage begins. transcription of the betagrp-2 was up-regulated in larvae challenged with yeast or bacteria. betagrp-2 contains a region with sequence similarity to several glucanases but lacks glucanase activity. it aggregates yeasts and bacteria to, perhaps, limit the spread of invading cells and ensure a localized defense reaction. betagrp-2 binds laminarin and lipoteichoic acid, but not lipopolysaccharide. laminarin-triggered  prophenoloxidase activation was greatly enhanced in the induced larval hemolymph  supplemented with purified betagrp-2. complementing other studies on pattern recognition molecules in m. sexta, these results indicate that a complex system of protein sensors is an integral component of the insect immune system and that  different recognition molecules have overlapping binding specificity and functions.

AB  == setting: resuscitation promoting factors (rpfs) are proteins, originally identified in micrococcus luteus, that promote recovery of bacteria from a viable but non-replicating phase (e.g., stationary phase or latency) to a replicating phase. purified m. luteus rpf can stimulate growth and increase recovery of m. luteus bacteria as well as mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria from prolonged stationary cultures. objective: to clone and characterize rpfs from mycobacteria. design: we cloned one m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis rpf gene and one m. tuberculosis rpf gene into the pet19b or pet21a vector for expression in escherichia coli. the his-tag recombinant proteins were purified and characterized. results: when the purified recombinant proteins were added to sauton medium (a relatively minimal medium) at 100-500 pm, lag phase for mycobacteria from non-replicating cultures was shortened and there was a 10- to 100-fold increase in colony-forming units compared with control samples. in most  probable number assays, the mycobacterial rpfs increased recovery of mycobacteria from late stationary culture by about 10-fold. the rpfs also promoted recovery of extensively washed mycobacterium smegmatis bacteria inoculated into sauton medium. rpfs had only minor effects on growth of m. tuberculosis in bactec 12b broth, a rich medium. conclusion: the mycobacterial rpfs demonstrate resuscitation activities similar to those of the m. luteus rpf.

TI  == hemocyte-mediated phagocytosis and melanization in the mosquito armigeres subalbatus following immune challenge by bacteria.
AB  == mosquitoes are important vectors of disease. these insects respond to invading organisms with strong cellular and humoral immune responses that share many similarities with vertebrate immune systems. the strength and specificity of these responses are directly correlated to a mosquito's ability to transmit disease. in the current study, we characterized the hemocytes (blood cells) of armigeres subalbatus by morphology (ultrastructure), lectin binding, enzyme activity, immunocytochemistry, and function. we found four hemocyte types: granulocytes, oenocytoids, adipohemocytes, and thrombocytoids. granulocytes contained acid phosphatase activity and bound the exogenous lectins helix pomatia agglutinin, galanthus nivalis lectin, and wheat germ agglutinin. following bacteria inoculation, granulocytes mounted a strong phagocytic response as early  as 5 min postexposure. bacteria also elicited a hemocyte-mediated melanization response. phenoloxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the melanization pathway, was present exclusively in oenocytoids and in many of the melanotic capsules enveloping bacteria. the immune responses mounted against different bacteria were not identical; gram(-) escherichia coli were predominantly phagocytosed and gram(+) micrococcus luteus were melanized. these studies implicate hemocytes as the primary line of defense against bacteria.

TI  == isolation, purification and partial characterization of antibacterial activities  produced by a newly isolated streptomyces sp. us24 strain.
AB  == a new actinomycete strain designated us24 producing antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was isolated from tunisian soil. culture characteristic studies strongly suggested that the us24 strain belonged to the genus streptomyces. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene of the streptomyces sp. us24 strain showed high similarity (98%) with the 16s rrna gene of streptomyces caelestis which produces two antibiotics, niddamycin and celesticetin. study of the influence of different nutritional compounds on antibiotic biosynthesis showed that the highest antibacterial activities were obtained when starch at 1% (w/v) was used as sole carbon source in the presence of traces of mineral oligoelements. application to the supernatant culture of the streptomyces sp. us24 strain of various separation steps led to isolation of two pure active molecules having a retention time of 34 and 37.26 min, respectively. p(34 min) possessed antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, whereas p(37.26 min) inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. partial characterization of the p(34 min) molecule using  spectroscopic studies showed that this active molecule is different from the two  antibiotics produced by the s. caelestis strain.

TI  == construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using dielectrophoresis and flocculation.
AB  == a novel approach was developed for the construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using ac electrokinetics and flocculation. artificial structured microbial consortia (asmc) consisting of localized layered microcolonies of different cell types were formed by sequentially attracting different cell types to high field regions near microelectrodes using dielectrophoresis. stabilization of the microbial consortia on the electrode surface was achieved by crosslinking the cells using the flocculant polyethyleneimine (pei). consortia of escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were made as model systems. also, more natural consortia were made of the bacteria pseudomonas putida, clavibacter michiganense, and methylobacterium mesophilum, which are found together in consortia during biodegradation of metal-cutting waste fluids.

TI  == the solution structures and activity of caerin 1.1 and caerin 1.4 in aqueous trifluoroethanol and dodecylphosphocholine micelles.
AB  == the caerin 1 peptides are among the most powerful of the broad-spectrum antibiotic amphibian peptides. caerin 1.1 has previously been shown to form an amphipathic helix-bend-helix structure in aqueous trifluoroethanol (h. wong, j. h. bowie, and j. a. carver european journal biochemistry, 1997, vol. 247, pp. 545-557) and structure-activity relationship studies indicate that both helices are required for activity, as well as flexibility in the bend region connecting the two. the structure of caerin 1.1 in dodecylphosphocholine micelles was investigated and shown to be very similar to that determined in aqueous trifluoroethanol. caerin 1.4, which is identical to caerin 1.1, but with serine residues replacing val5 and gly7, is less active than caerin 1.1 against most bacterial species but has improved activity against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus. the solution nmr structure of caerin 1.4 was determined in both aqueous trifluoroethanol and dodecylphosphocholine micelles, and was shown to be similar to caerin 1.1. it was concluded that differences in the hydrophobicity and hydrophilic angle of the first helix are probably responsible  for the different spectra of antibacterial activity. the similarity of the structures calculated in aqueous trifluoroethanol and dodecylphosphocholine micelles suggests that, for caerin 1.1 and 1.4, these solvent systems are equally as good at representing a membrane environment.

TI  == detection of lysozyme-like enzymatic activity secreted by an immune-responsive mosquito cell line.
AB  == using molecular approaches, we have recently shown that the c7-10 mosquito cell line from aedes albopictus, and the aag-2 line from aedes aegypti, secrete a variety of immune peptides into the culture medium, including cecropins, defensins, transferrin, and lysozyme. the diversity of these peptides makes it difficult to quantify the relative activities of each molecule, because possible  synergistic interactions may occur. using a microtiter plate assay with live bacteria, we now show that c7-10 cells secrete an activity that is more potent against the gram-positive bacterium, micrococcus luteus, than against gram-negative escherichia coli. this lysozyme-like activity is accompanied by production of a lytic zone in an agarose plate assay containing commercially available, lyophilized m. luteus. properties of the lysozyme-like activity from c7-10 cells included a broad ph optimum from 5.5 to 6.5, and heat-sensitivity above 42 degrees c. amounts of secreted activity increased during the initial 24h of incubation with heat-killed bacteria. during this induction, lysozyme-like activity was found primarily in the cell culture supernatant.

TI  == rapid phagocytosis and melanization of bacteria and plasmodium sporozoites by hemocytes of the mosquito aedes aegypti.
AB  == mosquitoes are vectors of many deadly and debilitating pathogens. in the current  study, we used light and electron microscopies to study the immune response of aedes aegypti hemocytes to bacterial inoculations, plasmodium gallinaceum natural infections, and latex bead injections. after challenge, mosquitoes mounted strong phagocytic and melanization responses. granulocytes phagocytosed bacteria singly  or pooled them inside large membrane-delimited vesicles. phagocytosis of bacteria, plasmodium sporozoites, and latex beads was extensive; we estimated that individual granulocytes have the capacity to phagocytose hundreds of bacteria and thousands of latex particles. oenocytoids were also seen to internalize bacteria and latex particles, although infrequently and with low capacity. besides phagocytosis, mosquitoes cleared bacteria and sporozoites by melanization. interestingly, the immune response toward 2 species of bacteria was different; most escherichia coli were phagocytosed, but most micrococcus luteus were melanized. similar to e. coli, most plasmodium sporozoites were phagocytosed. the immune response was rapid; phagocytosis and melanization of bacteria began as early as 5 min after inoculation. the magnitude and speed of the cellular response suggest that hemocytes, acting in concert with the humoral  immune response, are the main force driving the battle against foreign invaders.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray crystallographic studies of salt-tolerant glutaminase from micrococcus luteus k-3.

TI  == humoral immune response of simulium damnosum s.l. following filarial and bacterial infections.
AB  == the time-course of the humoral immune response of female blackflies after a challenge with bacteria, different onchocerca microfilariae species, bacterial endotoxin and microfilarial extract was investigated. strong bacteriolytic and growth inhibition activities against the gram-positive bacterium micrococcus luteus were induced by all agents. specific differences were found in activity levels and time-course. notably the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced a  very early, profound bacteriolytic and antibacterial response, which declined within a day after injection. in contrast, the bacteriolytic activities after escherichia coli d31 and onchocerca microfilariae infections were lower, but remained elevated over the observation period of 4 days. the bacteriolytic activity was correlated to a haemolymph protein with a molecular weight of around 14 kda. anti-gram-positive activity in the e. coli infected group appeared within the first 6 h. however, it took 4 days in the microfilarial infected blackflies to reach significant levels. the active agent was identified to be a peptide with a molecular weight of around 4-4.5 kda. activity against the gram-negative bacteria e. coli was detected in blackflies injected with e. coli d31, o. dukei microfilariae and microfilarial extract on days 1 and 4 after injection. the immune response in s. damnosum s.l. naturally infected via a bloodmeal on cattle  supported the findings of the experimental infections. similarities of the immune response kinetics between bacterial and filarial infections suggested that intracellular wolbachia bacteria, released from microfilariae, could be responsible for the antibacterial response. this is supported by the observation  that the induction of an immune response in the drosophila melanogaster mbn-2 cell line by the filarial extract is blocked by polymyxin b, which forms inactive complexes with bacterial lps.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == enteric bacteria counteract lipopolysaccharide induction of antimicrobial peptide genes.
AB  == the humoral immunity of drosophila involves the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are induced by evolutionary conserved microbial molecules, like lps. by using drosophila mbn-2 cells, we found that live bacteria, including e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, erwinia carotovora, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, prevented lps from inducing antimicrobial peptide genes, while micrococcus luteus and streptococcus equi did not. the inhibitory effect was seen at bacterial levels from 20 per mbn-2 cell, while antimicrobial peptides were induced at lower bacterial concentrations (< or =2 bacteria per cell) also in the absence of added lps. gel shift experiment suggests that the inhibitory effect is upstream or at the level of the activation of the transcription factor relish, a member of the nf-kappab/rel family. the bacteria have to be in physical contact with the cells, but not phagocytosed, to prevent lps induction. interestingly, the inhibiting mechanism is, at least for e. coli, independent of the type iii secretion system, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is unrelated to the one earlier described for yopj from yersinia.

AB  == a humoral immune response in larvae of the coleopteran insect, anomala cuprea has been examined for exploring the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions. the antibacterial activity against the gram-positive strain, micrococcus luteus was detected at a low level in absence of injection. the activity increased strikingly in the hemolymph of the larvae challenged with escherichia coli, showing the fluctuating profile through a time course, which consists of the static induction phase, the production phase rising to a maximum level, and the reduction phase extending over a long duration. two peptides were purified and characterized by reverse-phase hplc, edman degradation and mass spectrometry. they were isoforms, composed of similar sequences with two amino acid substitutions in 43 residues, and novel members of the insect defensins, cysteine-rich antibacterial peptides. anomala defensins a and b showed potent activity against gram-positive bacteria, with slight differences in activity against a few strains of tested bacteria. anomala defensin b was active at high concentration of 40 microm against the gram-negative strain, xenorhabdus japonicus, a pathogen toward the host, a. cuprea larvae.

TI  == dicynthaurin: an antimicrobial peptide from hemocytes of the solitary tunicate, halocynthia aurantium.
AB  == we isolated a novel antimicrobial peptide, dicynthaurin, from hemocytes of a tunicate, halocynthia aurantium. the native peptide had a mass of approximately 6.2 kda and was composed of two 30-residue monomers without sequence homology to  any previously identified peptides (ilqkavldclkaagsslskaaitaiynkit). most cynthaurin molecules were c-terminally amidated and were linked covalently by a single cystine disulfide bond. when performed in membrane-mimetic environments, circular dichroism studies of dicynthaurin revealed largely alpha-helical conformations. dicynthaurin's broad-spectrum activity encompassed gram-positive (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa), but not candida albicans, a fungus. although dicynthaurin was purified from a marine invertebrate, its antimicrobial activity was optimal at nacl concentrations below 100 mm. this suggests that the antimicrobial actions of this molecule may take place intracellularly (e.g., within a phagosome) rather than extracellularly.

TI  == the effect of cyclization of magainin 2 and melittin analogues on structure, function, and model membrane interactions: implication to their mode of action.
AB  == the amphipathic alpha-helical structure is a common motif found in membrane binding polypeptides including cell lytic peptides, antimicrobial peptides, hormones, and signal sequences. numerous studies have been undertaken to understand the driving forces for partitioning of amphipathic alpha-helical peptides into membranes, many of them based on the antimicrobial peptide magainin 2 and the non-cell-selective cytolytic peptide melittin, as paradigms. these studies emphasized the role of linearity in their mode of action. here we synthesized and compared the structure, biological function, and interaction with model membranes of linear and cyclic analogues of these peptides. cyclization altered the binding of melittin and magainin analogues to phospholipid membranes. however, at similar bound peptide:lipid molar ratios, both linear and cyclic analogues preserved their high potency to permeate membranes. furthermore, the cyclic analogues preserved approximately 75% of the helical structure of the linear peptides when bound to membranes. biological activity studies revealed that the cyclic melittin analogue had increased antibacterial activity but decreased hemolytic activity, whereas the cyclic magainin 2 analogue had a marked decrease in both antibacterial and hemolytic activities. the results indicate that the linearity of the peptides is not essential for the disruption of the target phospholipid membrane, but rather provides the means to reach it. in addition, interfering with the coil-helix transition by cyclization, while maintaining the same sequence of hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids,  allows a separated evaluation of the hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions  to binding of peptides to membranes.

TI  == inhibition tests for detection and presumptive identification of tetracyclines, beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones in poultry meat.
AB  == a combination of three plates, seeded with strains of micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus or escherichia coli, can be used for detection of residues of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. the sensitivity of each plate is optimal for only one of these groups, resulting in detection limits (lod) lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (mrl) and in distinct inhibition patterns typical for each antibiotic family. beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin g, ampicillin and amoxicillin give only inhibition zones on the plate with m. luteus. tetracyclines are detected up to the mrl level with b.  cereus, and fluoroquinolones with e. coli. the lods of the antibiotics tested were as follows: penicillin g (peng) 0.9 ng, ampicillin (ampi) 0.6 ng and amoxicillin (amox) 1.0 ng on the plate with m. luteus; tetracycline (tet) 4 ng, oxytetracycline (oxy) 3 ng, doxycycline (dox) 0.6 ng, and chlortetracycline (chl) 0.3 ng on the plate with b. cereus; enrofloxacin (enrx) 1.5 ng, ciprofloxacin (cipx) 0.5 ng and flumequine (flum) 1.5 ng on the plate with e. coli. the combination of plates enables the laboratory to select appropriate chromatographic techniques for identification and quantification of the residues. on the other hand, the three groups can also be detected on one plate seeded with bacillus subtilis, although the limits of detection are higher: peng 0.4 ng, ampi and amox 3 ng, tet 5 ng, oxy 8 ng, dox 1 ng, chl 0.5 ng, enrx 4 ng, cipx 10 ng and flum 4 ng. the test was applied to 228 broiler fillets and to 27 turkey thighs, originating from different poultry slaughterhouses. nineteen broiler fillets contained inhibiting substances. the positive results of the inhibition tests were confirmed with a chromatographic technique. doxycycline residues were  found in 16 samples and amoxicillin in two.

TI  == an alternative cis-isoprenyltransferase activity in yeast that produces polyisoprenols with chain lengths similar to mammalian dolichols.
AB  == dolichyl monophosphate (dol-p) is a polyisoprenoid glycosyl carrier lipid essential for the assembly of a variety of glycoconjugates in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. in yeast, dolichols with chain lengths of 14--17 isoprene units are predominant, whereas in mammalian cells they contain 19--22 isoprene units. in this biosynthetic pathway, t,t-farnesyl pyrophosphate is elongated to the appropriate long chain polyprenyl pyrophosphate by the sequential addition of cis-isoprene units donated by isopentenyl pyrophosphate with t,t,c-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate being the initial intermediate formed. the condensation steps are catalyzed by cis-isoprenyltransferase (cis-iptase). genes encoding cis-iptase activity have been identified in micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, arabidopsis thaliana, and saccharomyces cerevisiae (rer2). yeast cells deleted for the rer2 locus display a severe growth defect, but are still viable, possibly due to the activity of an homologous locus, srt1. the dolichol and dol-p content of exponentially growing revertants of rer2 deleted cells (delta rer2) and of cells overexpressing srt1 have been determined by hplc  analysis. dolichols and dol-ps with 19--22 isoprene units, unusually long for yeast, were found, and shown to be utilized for the biosynthesis of lipid intermediates involved in protein n-glycosylation. in addition, cis-iptase activity in microsomes from delta rer2 cells overexpressing srt1 was 7- to 17-fold higher than in microsomes from delta rer2 cells. these results establish  that yeast contains at least two cis-iptases, and indicate that the chain length  of dolichols is determined primarily by the enzyme catalyzing the chain elongation stage of the biosynthetic process.

TI  == properties of the prophenoloxidase activating enzyme of the freshwater crayfish,  pacifastacus leniusculus.
AB  == the prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (ppa), a serine proteinase catalyzing the  conversion of prophenoloxidase to an active phenoloxidase, has a molecular mass of about 36 kda in its active form. this protein was cloned from a blood cell cdna library and its corresponding cdna of 1736 base pairs encodes a zymogenic protein (proppa) of 468 amino acids. an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from a region of the cdna sequence could efficiently inhibit the  beta-1,3-glucan triggered activation of prophenoloxidase in vitro. the c-terminal half of the proppa is composed of a typical serine proteinase domain, with a sequence similar to other invertebrate and vertebrate serine proteinases. the n-terminal half contains a cationic glycine-rich domain, a cationic proline-rich  domain and a clip-domain, in which the disulfide-bonding pattern is likely to be  identical to those of the horseshoe crab big defensin and mammalian beta-defensins. antibodies made against both the c- and the n-terminal halves recognize two proppas under reducing conditions. however, under nonreducing conditions only the anti-c antibody recognized the two proppas, which suggests that a conformational change takes place upon reduction that allows the anti-n to react with the n-terminal half of proppa. the recombinant clip-domain in crayfish proppa was overexpressed in escherichia coli and the resulting peptide exhibited  antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacterial strains such as micrococcus luteus ml11 and bacillus megaterium bm11 with 50% growth inhibitory concentrations of 1.43 microm and 17.9 microm, respectively. these results suggest that the clip-domains in proppas may function as antibacterial peptides.

TI  == the presence of antibacterial and opioid peptides in human plasma during coronary artery bypass surgery.
AB  == antibacterial peptides, found in both invertebrates and vertebrates, represent a  potential innate defense mechanism against microbial infections. however, it is unknown whether this process occurs in humans during surgery. we looked for evidence of release of antibacterial peptides during coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg). we used immunological techniques and antibacterial assays combined with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, reverse-phase hplc, n-terminal sequencing and comparison with synthetic standards to characterize the peptide b/enkelytin. we show the presence of anionic antibacterial peptide, the peptide b/enkelytin which correspond to the c-terminal part of proenkephalin a, from the plasma of patients undergoing cabg. our studies show that peptide b/enkelytin is initially present at low levels in plasma and is then released in  increased amounts just after skin incision. antibacterial assays confirmed that the peptides specifically target gram-positive bacteria. we also demonstrate that peptide b/enkelytin is metabolized in vivo to the opioid peptides methionine-enkephalin-arg-phe and methionine-enkephalin, peptides that we show have granulocyte chemotactic activity. these findings suggest that in humans, surgical incision leads to the release of antibacterial peptides. furthermore, these antibacterial peptides can be metabolized into compounds that have immune-activating properties.

TI  == molecular cloning, expression, and functional analysis of a cis-prenyltransferase from arabidopsis thaliana. implications in rubber biosynthesis.
AB  == cis-prenyltransferase catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic diphosphate to synthesize polyprenyl diphosphates that play vital roles in cellular activity. despite potential significance of cis-prenyltransferase in plant growth and development, no gene of the enzyme has  been cloned from higher plants. using sequence information of the conserved region of cis-prenyltransferase cloned recently from escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, and yeast, we have isolated and characterized the first plant cis-prenyltransferase from arabidopsis thaliana. sequence analysis revealed that  the protein is highly homologous in several conserved regions to cis-prenyltransferases from m. luteus, e. coli, and yeast. in vitro analyses using the recombinant protein overexpressed in e. coli revealed that the enzyme catalyzed the formation of polyprenyl diphosphates ranging in carbon number from  100 to 130 with a predominance of c(120). the enzyme exhibited a higher affinity  for farnesyl diphosphate than for geranylgeranyl diphosphate, with the k(m) values being 0.13 and 3.62 micrometer, respectively, but a lower affinity for isopentenyl diphosphate, with a k(m) value of 23 micrometer. in vitro rubber biosynthesis analysis indicated that the arabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase itself could not catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight polyprenyl diphosphates similar to natural rubber. a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain  reaction analysis showed that the gene was expressed at low levels in arabidopsis plant, in which expression of the cis-prenyltransferase in leaf and root was higher than that in stem, flower, and silique. these results indicate the tissue-specific expression of cis-prenyltransferase and suggest a potential role  and significance of the enzyme in the polyisoprenoid biosynthesis in plants.

TI  == amplifiable dna from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria by a low strength pulsed electric field method.
AB  == an efficient electric field-based procedure for cell disruption and dna isolation is described. isoosmotic suspensions of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  were treated with pulsed electric fields of <60 v/cm. pulses had an exponential decay waveform with a time constant of 3.4 micros. dna yield was linearly dependent on time or pulse number, with several thousand pulses needed. electrochemical side-effects and electrophoresis were minimal. the lysates contained non-fragmented dna which was readily amplifiable by pcr. as the method  was not limited to samples of high specific resistance, it should be applicable to physiological fluids and be useful for genomic and dna diagnostic applications.

TI  == purification and characterization of chitin-binding proteins from the hemolymph of sweet potato hornworm, agrius convolvuli.
AB  == three chitin-binding proteins (cbps: cbp9, cbp15, cbp66) were identified from the larval hemolymph of sweet potato hornworm, agrius convolvuli. two (cbp9 and cbp15) of them have been isolated and purified by gel filtration (superdex hr 75), cation-exchange chromatography (mono s), and reverse-phase chromatography (murpc pc 2.1/3). in experiments to detect cbps in hemolymph, we examined whether ionic strength and existence of bovine serum albumin in the incubation solution influenced binding affinity of cbps to chitin. the n-terminal sequences of three  cbps were determined by the automated edman degradation and showed the sequence homology in basic local alignment search tool search cbp15 and cbp66 were quite similar to lysozymes and bovine serum albumins, respectively. in contrast, cbp9 is not similar to any other known protein, as judged from databank comparisons. therefore, we concluded that cbp9 is a novel protein with binding capacity to chitin that is a component of the fungal cell wall. cbp9 has no antibacterial activity against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus, and also showed negative response in hemagglutination assay. cbp9 is confirmed as a monomer with  a molecular mass of 9.14 kda by electron spray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.

TI  == androctonin, a hydrophilic disulphide-bridged non-haemolytic anti-microbial peptide: a plausible mode of action.
AB  == androctonin is a 25-residue non-haemolytic anti-microbial peptide isolated from the scorpion androctonus australis and contains two disulphide bridges. androctonin is different from known native anti-microbial peptides, being a relatively hydrophilic and non-amphipathic molecule. this raises the possibility  that the target of androctonin might not be the bacterial membrane, shown to be a target for most amphipathic lytic peptides. to shed light on its mode of action on bacteria and its non-haemolytic activity, we synthesized androctonin, its fluorescent derivatives and its all-d-amino acid enantiomer. the enantiomer preserved high activity, suggesting a lipid-peptide interaction between androctonin and bacterial membranes. in gram-positive and (at higher concentrations) gram-negative bacteria, androctonin induced an immediate perturbation of the permeability properties of the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacterial energetic state, concomitant with perturbation of the morphology of the cell envelope as revealed by electron microscopy. androctonin binds only to negatively charged lipid vesicles and induces the leakage of markers at high concentrations and with a slow kinetics, in contrast with amphipathic alpha-helical anti-microbial peptides that bind and permeate negatively charged vesicles, and to a smaller extent also zwitterionic ones. this might explain the  selective lytic activity of androctonin towards bacteria but not red blood cells. polarized attenuated total reflection-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that androctonin adopts a beta-sheet structure in membranes and did not  affect the lipid acyl chain order, which supports a detergent-like effect. the small size of androctonin, its hydrophilic character and its physicochemical properties are favourable features for its potential application as a replacement for commercially available antibiotics to which bacteria have developed resistance.

TI  == effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  == the ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate e. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. the effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of e. coli in broth medium showed that only edta and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of e. coli by nisin. in a broth where l. lactis ncfb 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 iu/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate e. coli. under the same conditions, addition of edta led to inactivation of e. coli at neutral and slightly acidic ph only. a cocktail of strains of e. coli was less sensitive than e. coli atcc 25922 alone. pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant.  edta also caused a slight reduction in the l. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards ph drop and acid production. some of the inhibition of e. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. failure to observe  any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural ph (4.0) was ascribed to the  poor chelating power of edta under acid conditions.

AB  == streptococcus milleri nmscc 061 was screened for antimicrobial substances and shown to produce a bacteriolytic cell wall hydrolase, termed millericin b. the enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a four-step purification procedure that consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration, ultrafiltration, and ion-exchange chromatography. the yield following ion-exchange chromatography was 6.4%, with a greater-than-2,000-fold increase in  specific activity. the molecular weight of the enzyme was 28,924 as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. the amino acid sequences of both the n terminus of the enzyme (nh(2) sendfslamvsn) and an internal fragment which was generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage (nh(2) siqtnapwgl) were determined by automated edman degradation. millericin b displayed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria but was not active against bacillus subtilis w23 or escherichia coli atcc 486 or against the producer strain itself. n-dinitrophenyl  derivatization and hydrazine hydrolysis of free amino and free carboxyl groups liberated from peptidoglycan digested with millericin b followed by thin-layer chromatography showed millericin b to be an endopeptidase with multiple activities. it cleaves the stem peptide at the n terminus of glutamic acid as well as the n terminus of the last residue in the interpeptide cross-link of susceptible strains.

TI  == variable selection and multivariate methods for the identification of microorganisms by flow cytometry.
AB  == background: when exploited fully, flow cytometry can be used to provide multiparametric data for each cell in the sample of interest. while this makes flow cytometry a powerful technique for discriminating between different cell types, the data can be difficult to interpret. traditionally, dual-parameter plots are used to visualize flow cytometric data, and for a data set consisting of seven parameters, one should examine 21 of these plots. a more efficient method is to reduce the dimensionality of the data (e.g., using unsupervised methods such as principal components analysis) so that fewer graphs need to be examined, or to use supervised multivariate data analysis methods to give a prediction of the identity of the analyzed particles. materials and methods: we collected multiparametric data sets for microbiological samples stained with six  cocktails of fluorescent stains. multivariate data analysis methods were explored as a means of microbial detection and identification. results: we show that while all cocktails and all methods gave good accuracy of predictions (>94%), careful selection of both the stains and the analysis method could improve this figure (to > 99% accuracy), even in a data set that was not used in the formation of the supervised multivariate calibration model. conclusions: flow cytometry provides a rapid method of obtaining multiparametric data for distinguishing between microorganisms. multivariate data analysis methods have an important role to play in extracting the information from the data obtained. artificial neural networks  proved to be the most suitable method of data analysis.

TI  == molecular analysis of prenyl chain elongating enzymes.
AB  == multiple alignments of primary structures of many kinds of prenyltransferases that participate in the most fundamental prenyl-chain backbone synthesizing process in isoprenoid biosynthesis showed seven conserved regions in the primary  structures of (e)-prenyl diphosphate synthases. however, no information has been  available about the structures of (z)-prenyl diphosphate synthases until our recent isolation of the gene for the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase of micrococcus luteus b-p 26. the amino acid sequence of the (z)-prenyl diphosphate  synthase is totally different from those of (e)-prenyl chain elongating enzymes.  protein data base searches for sequences similar to that of the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase yielded many unknown proteins which have not yet been characterized. two of the proteins have recently been identified as the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase of escherichia coli and the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase of saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that there are three highly conserved regions in the primary structure of (z)-prenyl chain elongating  enzymes.

TI  == constitutive activation of toll-mediated antifungal defense in serpin-deficient drosophila.
AB  == the antifungal defense of drosophila is controlled by the spaetzle/toll/cactus gene cassette. here, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding a blood serine protease inhibitor, spn43ac, was shown to lead to constitutive expression  of the antifungal peptide drosomycin, and this effect was mediated by the spaetzle and toll gene products. spaetzle was cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to its active ligand form shortly after immune challenge, and cleaved spaetzle was constitutively present in spn43ac-deficient flies. hence, spn43ac negatively regulates the toll signaling pathway, and toll does not function as a pattern recognition receptor in the drosophila host defense.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

TI  == gram positive bacteria induce il-6 and il-8 production in human alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: inhalation of dust from swine confinement buildings results in an acute inflammatory reaction in the respiratory tract. the dust has  a high microbial content, dominated by gram positive bacteria. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the significance of bacteria in the induction of il-6 and il-8 release from respiratory epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. the results would give an indication to what extent the bacteria contribute to the toxic inflammation following exposure to swine dust. methods: epithelial cells from a human lung carcinoma cell line (a549) and human alveolar macrophages obtained from healthy subjects by bronchoalveolar lavage, were stimulated with swine dust, lps, one gram negative and four gram positive bacteria strains. the dose-response release of il-6 and il-8 were studied. in addition, a bacteria-free supernatant was prepared from each strain and used for stimulation. results: with a few exceptions, a dose-dependent il-6 and il-8 release was demonstrated from both cell types after stimulation with bacteria. in epithelial cells, escherichia coli was the most potent bacteria at the highest concentration of 400 bacteria/cell regarding secretion of both il-6 and il-8 (p < 0.001), followed by  staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus lentus. in alveolar macrophages, s. lentus was the most potent strain (p < 0.001) in inducing cytokine release (p < 0.001), followed by s. hominis and e. coli concerning il-6 secretion or micrococcus luteus and e. coli with respect to il-8 secretion (p < 0.001). differences in potency between the various bacteria could be demonstrated, both within the two cell types as well as between the epithelial cells and macrophages. bacteria-free supernatants were also able to induce cytokine release in both cell types. in macrophages the supernatants were even more potent stimuli than whole bacteria. conclusions: the results indicate that bacteria or bacterial products could be an important contributing factor to the inflammatory reaction following exposure to swine dust.

TI  == isolation and purification of a campylobacter upsaliensis autolysin.
AB  == autolytic activity in the soluble and sediment fractions of sonicates of the spiral and the coccoid form of campylobacter upsaliensis could not be demonstrated by native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page). autolysins were detected, however, by using denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-page gels containing either purified escherichia coli peptidoglycan or whole cells of micrococcus luteus (micrococcus lysodeikticus) as the turbid substrate, with subsequent renaturation by treatment with triton x-100 buffer. in renaturing gels that contained escherichia coli peptidoglycan, 14 putative autolytic bands ranging from 200 to 12 kda were detected. in similar gels containing whole cells of m. luteus, only a single band appeared with a molecular mass of 34 kda. this band corresponded to one of the bands present in the gels containing escherichia coli peptidoglycan. this common autolysin was isolated by  adsorbing it from campylobacter upsaliensis soluble fractions onto m. luteus cells and then subjecting these cells to renaturing sds-page in gels containing escherichia coli peptidoglycan. the 34-kda autolysin differed from a single 51-kda autolysin unique to the m. luteus cells, and when isolated from an sds-page gel, was pure when tested by isoelectric focusing. the n-terminal amino  acid sequence analysis showed the first 15 amino acids of the 34-kda autolysin to have 67% identity to a part of antigenic protein peb4 of campylobacter jejuni. the purified autolysin was used to immunize rabbits and the antibodies produced precipitated autolytic activity from cell lysates. the specificity of the antibodies was shown by western blotting: only a single specific band occurred, with a molecular mass of 34 kda, and thus it seems unlikely that the 34-kda autolysin was derived from any of the other autolysins that were detected.

TI  == the escherichia coli homologue of yeast rer2, a key enzyme of dolichol synthesis, is essential for carrier lipid formation in bacterial cell wall synthesis.
AB  == we found in the escherichia coli genome sequence a homologue of rer2, a saccharomyces cerevisiae gene required for proper localization of an endoplasmic  reticulum protein, and designated it rth (rer2 homologue). the disruption of this gene was lethal for e. coli. to reveal its biological function, we isolated temperature-sensitive mutants of the rth gene. the mutant cells became swollen and burst at the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that their cell wall integrity was defective. further analysis showed that the mutant cells were deficient in the activity of cis-prenyltransferase, namely, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, a key enzyme of the carrier lipid formation of peptidoglycan synthesis. the cellular level of undecaprenyl phosphate was in fact markedly decreased in the mutants. these results are consistent with the fact that the rer2 homologue of micrococcus luteus shows undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase activity (n. shimizu, t. koyama, and k. ogura, j. biol. chem. 273:19476-19481, 1998) and demonstrate that e. coli rth is indeed responsible for the maintenance of cell wall rigidity. our work on the yeast rer2 mutants shows that they are defective in the activity of cis-prenyltransferase, namely, dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase, a key enzyme of dolichol synthesis. taking  these data together, we conclude that the rer2 gene family encodes cis-prenyltransferase, which plays an essential role in cell wall biosynthesis in bacteria and in dolichol synthesis in eukaryotic cells and has been well conserved during evolution.

TI  == insect immunity. isolation from the lepidopteran heliothis virescens of a novel insect defensin with potent antifungal activity.
AB  == lepidoptera have been reported to produce several antibacterial peptides in response to septic injury. however, in marked contrast to other insect groups, no inducible antifungal molecules had been described so far in this insect order. surprisingly, also cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides, which predominate in the antimicrobial defense of other insects, had not been discovered in lepidoptera. here we report the isolation from the hemolymph of immune induced larvae of the lepidopteran heliothis virescens of a cysteine-rich molecule with exclusive antifungal activity. we have fully characterized this antifungal molecule, which  has significant homology with the insect defensins, a large family of antibacterial peptides directed against gram-positive strains. interestingly, the novel peptide shows also similarities with the antifungal peptide drosomycin from drosophila. thus, lepidoptera appear to have built their humoral immune response  against bacteria on cecropins and attacins. in addition, we report that lepidoptera have conferred antifungal properties to the well conserved structure  of antibacterial insect defensins through amino acid replacements.

TI  == successful parasitation of locusts by entomopathogenic nematodes is correlated with inhibition of insect phagocytes.
AB  == the entomopathogenic nematodes heterorhabditis megidis and steinernema feltiae turned out to be successful antagonists of the orthopteran insects locusta migratoria and schistocerca gregaria. the death rate of locusts maintained on nematode-inoculated sand was remarkably high. even dosages as low as one nematode per cubic centimeter of sand killed approximately 50% of the locusts within 10 days. the impact of parasitation on locusts' immune defense was closely investigated for l. migratoria parasitized by h. megidis. adult locusts died within 30-35 h after being fed with 50 infective h. megidis juveniles. within the first 30 h after ingestion of the nematodes, locust hemolymph was assayed for alterations in the humoral and cellular defense components and for the presence of the nematode-associated photorhabdus luminescens bacteria. humoral defense was generally low without any correlation to the state of parasitation. there was no  detectable activity against escherichia coli and only little lysozyme-like activity against micrococcus luteus. in contrast, cellular defense components were strongly influenced by parasitation. most interestingly, the phagocytic capacity of the hemocytes was already hampered 12 h after oral application of the nematodes, whereas considerable hemocyte death occurred not earlier than 24 h after feeding. the nematode-associated bacteria could be detected in hemolymph of some of the nematode-fed locusts as early as 3 h after feeding and in all hemolymph samples after 24 h. supernatants from isolated p. luminescens cultures  were able to inhibit the l. migratoria phagocytes in vitro; thus the successful parasitation appears to be dependent on an inhibition by bacteria-released compounds rather than on overloading or simply killing of the phagocytic active hemocytes.

TI  == mosquito-plasmodium interactions in response to immune activation of the vector.
AB  == during the development of plasmodium sp. within the mosquito midgut, the parasite undergoes a series of developmental changes. the elongated ookinete migrates through the layers of the midgut where it forms the oocyst under the basal lamina. we demonstrate here that if aedes aegypti or anopheles gambiae, normally  susceptible to plasmodium gallinaceum and p. berghei, respectively, are immune activated by the injection of bacteria into the hemocoel, and subsequently are fed on an infectious bloodmeal, there is a significant reduction in the prevalence and mean intensity of infection of oocysts on the midgut. only those mosquitoes immune activated prior to, or immediately after, parasite ingestion exhibit this reduction in parasite development. mosquitoes immune activated 2-5 days after bloodfeeding show no differences in parasite burdens compared with naive controls. northern analyses reveal that transcriptional activity for mosquito defensins is not detected in the whole bodies of ae. aegypti from 4 h to 10 days after ingesting p. gallinaceum, suggesting that parasite ingestion, passage from the food bolus through the midgut, oocyst formation, and subsequent  release of sporozoites into the hemolymph do not induce the production of defensin. however, reverse transcriptase-pcr of rna isolated solely from the midguts of ae. aegypti indicates that transcription of mosquito defensins occurs  in the midguts of naive mosquitoes and those ingesting an infectious or noninfectious bloodmeal. bacteria-challenged ae. aegypti showed high levels of mature defensin in the hemolymph that correlate with a lower prevalence and mean  intensity of infection with oocysts. because few oocysts were found on the midgut of immune-activated mosquitoes, the data suggest that some factor, induced by bacterial challenge, kills the parasite at a preoocyst stage.

TI  == which conditions promote a remanent (persistent) bactericidal activity of chlorine covers?
AB  == the interaction of disinfectants containing active chlorine compounds (hypochlorite, chloramine t) with skin surfaces produces a so called chlorine cover which is a true chemical transformation of the protein matrix of the outermost horny skin layer by forming covalent n-cl bonds. though its intensity can easily be measured, the results on its remanent (persistent) bactericidal action until now have not been described consistently. while gottardi and karl observed a well-defined remanent action which correlated with the cover strength  in the artificially with e. coli contaminated arm, koller, rotter, and gottardi were not able to prove it, neither in artificially contaminated hands nor in the  case of the resident bacterial colonization. to clarify these not consistent results, the bactericidal activity of chlorine covers on transient (dry contamination of the finger tips with micrococcus luteus) as well as on resident  colonization (after wearing gloves for 3 h) has been re-investigated using contact plates for recovering the bacteria. the results are showing that the remanent bactericidal action of chlorine covers strongly depends on the skin milieu, with moist conditions caused by sweat (surgical gloves) favoring the bactericidal activity. elution experiments prove that protein constituents (detected by uv-spectrometry) continuously are transported to the skin-surface. it is obvious that the latter equilibrate with the chlorine cover by forming bactericidal n-cl compounds with the effect that oxidation capacity fixed at the  protein matrix is mobilized enabling the remanent bactericidal action.

TI  == analysis of the drosophila host defense in domino mutant larvae, which are devoid of hemocytes.
AB  == we have analyzed the drosophila immune response in domino mutant larvae, which are devoid of blood cells. the domino mutants have a good larval viability, but they die as prepupae. we show that, on immune challenge, induction of the genes encoding antimicrobial peptides in the fat body is not affected significantly in  the mutant larvae, indicating that hemocytes are not essential in this process. the hemocoele of domino larvae contains numerous live microorganisms, the presence of which induces a weak antimicrobial response in the fat body. a full response is observed only after septic injury. we propose that the fat body cells are activated both by the presence of microorganisms and by injury and that injury potentiates the effect of microorganisms. survival experiments after an immune challenge showed that domino mutants devoid of blood cells maintain a wild-type resistance to septic injury. this resistance was also observed in mutant larvae in which the synthesis of antibacterial peptides is impaired (immune deficiency larvae) and in mutants that are deficient for humoral melanization (black cells larvae). however, if domino was combined with either the immune deficiency or the black cell mutation, the resistance to septic injury was reduced severely. these results establish the relevance of the three immune reactions: phagocytosis, synthesis of antibacterial peptides, and melanization. by working in synergy, they provide drosophila a highly effective defense against injury and/or infection.

AB  == larvae and adults of the mustard leaf beetle phaedon cochleariae (coleoptera: chrysomelidae) possess exocrine glands with secretions which are used in defense  against predators. this study addressed the question whether these defensive secretions also display antimicrobial activity. additionally, the effects of larval and adult hemolymph and larval regurgitate toward microorganisms were examined. the larval glandular secretion showed growth-inhibitory activity against the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli, but no lytic effect against cell walls of the gram-positive bacterium micrococcus luteus. growth of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and of the entomopathogenic fungus beauveria bassiana was also inhibited by the larval secretion. the antibacterial and antifungal activity of the larval secretion was found to be due to its main component, the iridoid monoterpene, (epi)chrysomelidial. the mechanism of its antifungal activity was examined by different bioassays and compared to the commercially available fungicide nystatin. the antifungal activity of the larval secretion is  not due to a loss of intracellular potassium in treated fungal cells, while high  potassium efflux from treated cells is the mode of action of common fungicides. the larval secretion exhibited direct cytotoxicity against both fungal cells and  plasmatocytes isolated from the greater wax moth galleria mellonella. in contrast to the larval secretion, the adult glandular secretion of p. cochleariae showed lytic activity against the cell walls of the gram-positive bacterium m. luteus, but no activity against the gram-negative bacterium e. coli and eukaryotic cells. hemolymph and larval regurgitate of p. cochleariae displayed the same activity as the tested glandular secretion of adults. copyright 1998 academic press.

TI  == intersubunit structure within heterodimers of medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases. formation of a hybrid-type heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase.
AB  == among prenyltransferases that catalyze the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic diphosphate to produce prenyl diphosphates with various  chain lengths and stereochemistries, medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases are exceptional in that they comprise two dissociable heteromeric protein components. these components exist without binding with each other under physiological conditions, and neither of them has any prenyltransferase activity  by itself. in order to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism underlying expression of the catalytic function by such a unique two-component system, we examined the possibility of forming a hybrid between two of the components of three different medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases, components i and ii of heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase from bacillus subtilis, components i' and ii' of heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase from bacillus stearothermophilus, and components a and b of hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase from micrococcus luteus b-p 26. as a result, only the hybrid-type combination of component i and component ii' gave distinct prenyltransferase activity. the hybrid-type enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of heptaprenyl diphosphate and showed moderate heat stability, which lay between those of the natural enzymes from b. subtilis and b. stearothermophilus. there is no possibility of forming a hybrid between the heptaprenyl and hexaprenyl diphosphate synthases.

TI  == molecular cloning, expression, and purification of undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase. no sequence similarity between e- and z-prenyl diphosphate synthases.
AB  == cloning of the gene for undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase was successful, providing the first primary structure for any prenyltransferase that catalyzes z-prenyl chain elongation. a genomic dna library of micrococcus luteus b-p 26 was constructed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant clones were grown on nylon membranes. the membrane was incubated directly by floating it on a reaction mixture containing radiolabeled isopentenyl diphosphate, nonlabeled farnesyl diphosphate, and mg2+. only the clones harboring plasmids encoding prenyltransferases could take up the substrates to synthesize and accumulate radiolabeled products inside the cells in amounts large enough to be detectable by autoradiography. four positive colonies were found among about 4,000 bacterial colonies of the genomic dna library. two of them carried the gene for undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, which catalyzes the z-prenyl chain elongation, and the others carried the (all-e)-hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase genes (hexs-a  and hexs-b; shimizu, n., koyama, t., and ogura, k. (1998) j. bacteriol. 180, 1578-1581). the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, which had a predicted molecular mass of 28.9 kda, was overproduced in e. coli cells by applying a soluble expression system, and it was purified to near homogeneity. the deduced primary structure of the z-prenyl chain-elongating enzyme is totally different from those of e-prenyl chain-elongating enzymes, which have characteristic conserved regions, including aspartate-rich motifs.

TI  == filarial dna and its interaction with polyamines and antifilarial drugs.
AB  == the interaction of dna from filarial parasite setaria cervi with polyamines was monitored by melting temperature (tm) profile, condensation and b to z dna transition and compared with dna of escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and calf thymus having different gc content. polyamines, viz. spermine and spermidine, stabilized the secondary structure of all dnas as indicated by increase in tm value. uv absorption studies indicated b to z dna transition in the presence of polyamines. the amount of polyamines required for b to z transition was dependent upon base composition of dna and charge of the polyamine. filarial dna (at rich)  required six times higher concentration of spermine as compared to gc rich dna for b to z dna transition. spermidine was not effective in causing transition of  s. cervi dna even at spd:dna-p ratio of 20. the antifilarial compound suramin significantly decreased melting temperature of filarial dna as compared to gc rich dnas of other parasites. suramin adversely affected condensation and b to z  dna transition of various dnas but prior addition of polyamines protected the dnas from the destabilizing effect of suramin.

TI  == in vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc-9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853), escherichia coli, and streptococcus sp. the strains were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi), with the exception of f. nucleatum (bhi-pras). pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h  and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. incubation was conducted at 37 degrees  c for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on m. luteus and f. nucleatum, 24 h on streptococcus sp, 48 h on e. coli, and 72 h on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. mixture ii (m. luteus + streptococcus sp + s. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture i (m. luteus + e. coli + p. aeruginosa), mixture iii (e. coli + p. aeruginosa), and mixture iv (s. aureus + p. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.

TI  == the sandfly lutzomyia longipalpis shows specific humoral responses to bacterial challenge.
AB  == the presence of immune molecules induced by microorganisms in the haemolymph of lutzomyia longipalpis sandflies has been investigated. injections of escherichia  coli and micrococcus luteus into female sandflies induced anti-bacterial activity in the haemolymph. inhibition zone assays showed that haemolymph from e. coli and m.luteus injected sandflies differentially inhibited m.luteus growth. this differential effect was specific to m.luteus infection since anti-e.coli activity was similar in haemolymph from both e.coli or m.luteus injected sandflies. haemolymph following injection of either bacteria showed the induction of a 4 kda peptide. haemolymph from m.luteus injected sandflies also contained a 33 kda polypeptide which was absent in haemolymph from e.coli and control uninfected insects. sandflies, in common with other insects, were shown to possess general and specific humoral immune responses to the presence of microorganisms.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == novel antibacterial peptides isolated from a european bumblebee, bombus pascuorum (hymenoptera, apoidea).
AB  == we present here the isolation and characterization of four antimicrobial peptides produced by a european bumblebee bombus pascuorum. a 51-residue insect defensin was characterized which, like the apis mellifera defensins, had a highly conserved 12-residue extension to its c-terminal compared to defensins from other insects. monoisotopic mass analysis of the c-terminal of b. pascuorum defensin confirmed that this molecule was c-terminally amidated. this defensin showed strong anti-gram-positive activity and some anti-fungal activity; also, in contrast to other insect defensins, it showed anti-gram-negative activity. a 17-residue apidaecin was characterized, showing anti-gram-negative activity, and  differing by a single amino acid substitution from the a. mellifera apidaecin. a  39-residue abaecin was isolated, the largest proline-rich antimicrobial peptide characterized to date, which showed activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. finally, we isolated an n-terminally blocked molecule, with a molecular mass of 10,122 da, which showed activity against gram-negative bacteria only. these characteristics are reminiscent of hymenoptaecin from the honeybee a. mellifera, but a definitive characterization of this molecule awaits  further work. no evidence of lysozyme activity was found in the haemolymph of challenged or naive b. pascuorum.

TI  == function of the novel subdomain in the rna binding domain of transcription termination factor rho from micrococcus luteus.
AB  == transcription termination factor rho from micrococcus luteus, a high g + c gram-positive bacterium, contains an unusual extra sequence within its rna binding domain that is rich in arg, glu, and asp residues and deficient in hydrophobic residues. to determine the role of this extra sequence, we compared the biochemical properties of a variant lacking nearly all the extra sequence, des(60-300) rho, to that of wild-type m. luteus rho. the two forms had very similar properties except that the des(60-300) rho was unable to terminate transcription with escherichia coli rna polymerase at the promoter proximal sites used by the wild-type rho on a lambda cro dna template but could cause termination at more distal sites and did cause termination at proximal sites when itp replaced gtp in the reaction mixture. the rna binding properties of the two forms of this rho with normal and inosine-substituted rnas were found to correlate fully with their termination properties. these results indicate that the arginine-rich extra sequence is directly involved in the selection of the termination site and support the hypothesis that the sequence is present in m. luteus rho to facilitate its binding to m. luteus transcripts, which are likely to have a high degree of base-paired secondary structure because of their high proportion of g residues.

TI  == uv endonuclease of micrococcus luteus, a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-dna glycosylase/abasic lyase: cloning and characterization of the gene.
AB  == the gene of micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-dna  glycosylase/ abasic lyase) was cloned and characterized. the cloned gene, whose product had a predicted molecular mass of 17,120 da, was found to be capable of complementing the escherichia coli uvra6 mutation in vivo with respect to resistance to acetonemediated molecular photosensitization, a treatment producing exclusively cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in dna. it also generated a nicking activity specific for photosensitization-treated dna by in vitro transcription/translation. when expressed in e. coli cells, the gene produced a protein structurally identical with uv endonuclease and possessing an activity consistent with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-dna glycosylase/abasic lyase with respect to the effect of inhibitors and the site of the dna backbone scission. furthermore, the uv endonuclease-deficient mutant db7 was shown to regain the enzyme through transformation with the cloned gene. the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product was at best 27% identical with that of endonuclease  v of phage t4, an enzyme strikingly similar to uv endonuclease in molecular and catalytic properties. despite this marginal overall similarity in amino acid sequence, four of the seven amino acid residues reported to be functionally important in the t4 enzyme were found to be conserved in the m. luteus enzyme. we propose that the gene be called uvea.

TI  == the topodynamics of incision of uv-irradiated covalently closed dna by the escherichia coli uvr(a)bc endonuclease.
AB  == the escherichia coli uvr(a)bc endonuclease (uvr(a)bc) initiates nucleotide excision repair of a large variety of dna damages. the damage recognition and incision steps by the uvr(a)bc is a complex process utilizing an atp-dependent dna helix-tracking activity associated with the uvra2b1 complex. the latter activity leads to the generation of highly positively supercoiled dna in the presence of e. coli topoisomerase i in vitro. such highly positively supercoiled  dna, containing ultraviolet irradiation-induced photoproducts (uvdna), is resistant to the incision by uvr(a)bc, whereas the negatively supercoiled and relaxed forms of the uvdna are effectively incised. the e. coli gyrase can contribute to the above reaction by abolishing the accumulation of highly positively supercoiled uvdna thereby restoring uvr(a)bc-catalyzed incision. eukaryotic (calf thymus) topoisomerase i is able to substitute for gyrase in restoring this uvr(a)bc-mediated incision reaction. the inability of uvr(a)bc to  incise highly positively supercoiled uvdna results from the failure of the formation of uvrab-dependent obligatory intermediates associated with the dna conformational change. in contrast to uvr(a)bc, the micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease efficiently incises uvdna regardless of its topological state. the in vitro topodynamic system proposed in this study may provide a simple model for studying a topological aspect of nucleotide excision repair and its interaction with other dna topology-related processes in e. coli.

AB  == dielectrophoresis, the lateral motion induced on particles by non-uniform electric fields, is a sensitive function of the electrical conductivity of the particle suspending medium. this dependence is exploited in a new technique for separating bioparticles from suspended mixtures. the bioparticles are first immobilised by positive dielectrophoresis at electrodes in a separation chamber,  and the conductivity of the liquid flowing through the chamber is then gradually  and continuously increased so as to produce a conductivity gradient with time. the bioparticles are released from the electrodes according to their own dielectric properties and as a function of flow rate and medium conductivity. this is demonstrated for pure suspensions and mixtures of the bacteria bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus.

TI  == aedes aegypti: induced antibacterial proteins reduce the establishment and development of brugia malayi.
AB  == the effect of host immune activation on the development of brugia malayi in one susceptible and four refractory strains of aedes aegypti and in armigeres subalbatus was assessed. a. aegypti that were immune activated by the injection of saline or bacteria 24 hr before feeding on a b. malayi-infected gerbil had significantly reduced prevalences and mean intensities of infection from those of naive controls when exposed to bloodmeals with low (105 mf/20 microliters) and medium (160 mf/20 microliters) microfilaremias. at a higher microfilaremia (237 mf/20 microliters) there were no significant differences in mean intensities, suggesting that the number of parasites ingested may affect the host's ability to mount an effective defense response. because the major immune proteins in a. aegypti are defensins, we did northern analyses of fat body rna 8 hr after immune activation or bloodfeeding. all mosquitoes demonstrated rapid transcriptional activity for defensins following immune activation by intrathoracic inoculation with either saline or bacteria. however, no strain of a. aegypti, susceptible or  refractory to b. malayi, nor ar. subalbatus produced defensin transcripts after bloodfeeding on an uninfected or a b. malayi-infected gerbil. these data suggest  that inducible immune proteins of mosquitoes can reduce the prevalence and mean intensity of infections with ingested parasites, but these proteins are not expressed routinely after parasite ingestion and midgut penetration and probably  do not contribute to existing refractory mechanisms. immune proteins such as defensins, however, represent potential candidates to genetically engineer mosquitoes for resistance to filarial worms.

TI  == the streptomyces peucetius drrc gene encodes a uvra-like protein involved in daunorubicin resistance and production.
AB  == the drrc gene, cloned from the daunorubicin (dnr)- and doxorubicin-producing strain of streptomyces peucetius atcc 29050, encodes a 764-amino-acid protein with a strong sequence similarity to the escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus  uvra proteins involved in excision repair of dna. expression of drrc was correlated with the timing of dnr production in the growth medium tested and was  not dependent on the presence of dnr. since introduction of drrc into streptomyces lividans imparted a dnr resistance phenotype, this gene is believed  to be a dnr resistance gene. the drrc gene could be disrupted in the non-dnr-producing s. peucetius dnrj mutant but not in the wild-type strain, and the resulting dnrj drrc double mutant was significantly more sensitive to dnr in  efficiency-of-plating experiments. expression of drrc in an e. coli uvra strain conferred significant dnr resistance to this highly dnr-sensitive mutant. however, the drrc protein did not complement the uvra mutation to protect the mutant from the lethal effects of uv or mitomycin even though it enhanced the uv  resistance of a uvra+ strain. we speculate that the drrc protein mediates a novel type of dnr resistance, possibly different from the mechanism of dnr resistance governed by the s. peucetius drrab genes, which are believed to encode a dnr antiporter.

TI  == synergistic contributions of asparagine 46 and aspartate 52 to the catalytic mechanism of chicken egg white lysozyme.
AB  == the x-ray structure of a chicken egg white lysozyme (chewl) complex with a peptidoglycan-derived inhibitor suggests that interactions of asn46 and asp52 with the d-subsite n-acetylmuramic acid residue help to distort that pyranose ring into the reactive half-chair conformation and that a hydrogen bond is formed between asn46 and asp52 [strynadka, n. c. j., & james, m. n. g. (1991) j. mol. biol. 220, 401-424]. these hypotheses were investigated through the d52a, n46a, and d52a/n46a mutants of chewl. the michaelis constants of the d52a and d52a/n46a chewl complexes with micrococcus luteus cells are 3- and 4-fold higher, respectively, than the wild-type km; the corresponding kcat values are 25- and 50-fold lower, respectively, than the wild-type kcat. these results support the proposal of strynadka and james. the velocities of reactions catalyzed by the n46a and d52a mutants are approximately equal to each other for all classes of substrate, suggesting that the respective roles of asn46 and asp52 in transition  state stabilization do not vary. the mutation of either asn46 or asp52 to ala apparently disrupts the interactions of the other (nonmutated) residue with the substrate, supporting the crystallographic evidence of a hydrogen-bond interaction between the two residues. the mutations do not change the values of the dissociation constants of complexes with (carboxymethyl)chitin complexes, suggesting that ground state complexes of chewl with chitin-derived substrates differ in conformation from complexes with bacterial peptidoglycans.

TI  == is aspartate 52 essential for catalysis by chicken egg white lysozyme? the role of natural substrate-assisted hydrolysis.
AB  == the chicken and goose egg white lysozymes (chewl and goewl) are homologues, but differ in substrate specificity. chewl catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds of bacterial peptidoglycans and chitin-derived substrates, while goewl is specific for bacterial peptidoglycans. the active-site aspartate 52 residue of chewl, which is postulated to stabilize the oxocarbenium ion intermediate, has no counterpart in goewl. the substrate specificity of the d52a chewl mutant was compared with those of wild-type chewl and goewl. d52a chewl retains approximately 4% of the wild-type catalytic activity in reactions with three different bacterial cell suspensions. asp52 therefore is not essential to the catalytic mechanism, accounting for only a 2 kcal/mol decrease in delta g++. the  function of asp52 in d52a chewl- and goewl-catalyzed cleavage of (carboxymethyl)chitin may be partially fulfilled by an appropriately positioned carboxyl group on the substrate (substrate-assisted catalysis). d52a chewl and goewl, unlike wild-type chewl, exhibit biphasic kinetics in the clearing of micrococcus luteus cell suspensions, suggesting preferences for subsets of the linkages in the m. luteus peptidoglycan. these subsets do not exist in the peptidoglycans of escherichia coli or sarcina lutea, since neither d52a chewl nor goewl exhibits initial bursts in reactions with suspensions of these bacteria. we propose that substrate-assisted catalysis occurs in reactions of d52a chewl and goewl with m. luteus peptidoglycans, with the glycine carboxyl group of un-cross-linked peptides attached to n-acetylmuramic acid partially substituting  the function of the missing asp52.

TI  == ecdysone and insect immunity: the maturation of the inducibility of the diptericin gene in drosophila larvae.
AB  == the developmental analysis of the inducibility of the drosophila diptericin gene  promoter as a response to septic injury shows an important increase in the response during the third larval instar leading to a maximum in late larvae and early prepupae. this increase, or maturation, is temporally correlated with known ecdysone induced events of the salivary gland and we now present evidence, using  wild type and mutant larvae, that it does indeed depend upon ecdysone. the response remains minimal in larvae carrying either the temperature sensitive ecdysone deficient late larval lethal allele ecd1, or l(1)t187, a deep orange allele known to be deficient in the ecdysone response. however, experiments with  the late larval lethal broad-complex mutant l(1)t435 show that the regulation of  this response is distinct from the developmental ecdysone regulated hierarchies.

TI  == the c-terminal bisphosphorylated proenkephalin-a-(209-237)-peptide from adrenal medullary chromaffin granules possesses antibacterial activity.
AB  == the chromaffin granules have been shown to be an excellent model to study the processing of proenkephalin-a and chromogranins. recently, we reported a study dealing with the processing of chromogranin b/secretogranin i and the occurrence  of the c-terminal chromogranin b-derived peptide 614-626 which was shown to have  antibacterial activity [strub, j.m., garcia-sablone, p., looning, k., taupenot, l., hubert, p., van dorsselaer, a., aunis, d. & metz-boutigue, m.h. (1995) eur. j. biochem. 229, 356-368]. we also observed that this new antibacterial activity  present in chromaffin granules was associated with other endogenous protein-derived fragments yet to be characterized. the present study reports the  isolation and characterization of a peptide which possesses antibacterial activity and which corresponds to the c-terminal 209-237 sequence of proenkephalin-a. a detailed study using microsequencing and matrix-assisted-laser-desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (mald-tof ms) allowed us to correlate the antibacterial activity of this peptide named enkelytin (faeplpseeegesyskevpemekryggfm) with post-translational modifications.  endogenous bisphosphorylated proenkephalin-a-(209-237) was active on micrococcus  luteus and bacillus megaterium killing bacteria in the 0.2 - 0.4 microm range but was inactive in similar conditions towards escherichia coli. enkelytin shares sequence and structural similarities with the antibacterial c-terminal domain of  diazepam-binding inhibitor. according to this similarity, a prediction of secondary structure is proposed for enkelytin and discussed in relationship to its biological activity.

TI  == characterization of an unusual rho factor from the high g + c gram-positive bacterium micrococcus luteus.
AB  == a transcription termination factor (rho) was purified from the gram-positive bacterium micrococcus luteus, and the complete gene sequence was determined. the  m. luteus rho polypeptide has 690 residues, which is 271 residues more than its homolog from escherichia coli. most of the additional residues compose a highly charged, hydrophilic segment that is inserted in a non-conserved region between two conserved regions of the rna-binding domain of the known rho homolog proteins. this segment extends from residues 49 to 311 and includes a stretch of  238 residues that contain no hydrophobic side chains. biochemical studies indicate that the m. luteus protein is very similar to e. coli rho in terms of its rna-dependent ntpase activity and its sensitivity to the rho-specific inhibitor bicyclomycin. however, the m. luteus protein has a less stringent rna cofactor specificity. it also acts to terminate rna transcription with e. coli rna polymerase on the lambda cro dna template, but at much earlier termination stop points than those recognized by e. coli rho. thus, the m. luteus protein functions as a true rho factor, but with a different specificity than that of e.  coli rho. we propose that this altered specificity is consistent with its need to function on transcripts that have a high content of g + c residues.

TI  == purification and cloning of micrococcus luteus ultraviolet endonuclease, an n-glycosylase/abasic lyase that proceeds via an imino enzyme-dna intermediate.
AB  == although micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease has been reported to be an 18-kda enzyme with possible homology to the 16-kda endonuclease v from bacteriophage t4  (gordon, l. k., and haseltine, w. a. (1980) j. biol. chem. 255, 12047-12050; grafstrom, r. h., park, l., and grossman, l. (1982) j. biol. chem. 257, 13465-13474), this study describes three independent purification schemes in which m. luteus uv damage-specific or pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity  was associated with two proteins of apparent molecular masses of 31 and 32 kda. an 18-kda contaminant copurified with the doublet through many of the chromatographic steps, but it was determined to be a homolog of escherichia coli  ribosomal protein l6. edman degradation analyses of the active proteins yielded identical nh2-terminal amino acid sequences. the corresponding gene (pdg, pyrimidine dimer glycosylase) was cloned. the protein bears strong sequence similarities to the e. coli repair proteins endonuclease iii and muty. nonetheless, traditionally purified m. luteus protein acted exclusively on cis-syn thymine dimers; it was unable to cleave site-specific oligonucleotide substrates containing a trans-syn -i, (6-4), or dewar thymine dimer, a 5,6-dihydrouracil lesion, or an a:g or a:c mismatch. the uv endonuclease incised  cis-syn dimer-containing dna in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited linear kinetics within that dose range. enzyme activity was inhibited by the presence of nacn or nabh4 with nabh4 additionally being able to trap a covalent enzyme-substrate product. these last findings confirm that the catalytic mechanism of m. luteus uv endonuclease, like those of other glycosylase/ap lyases, involves an imino intermediate.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a secy homolog from streptomyces scabies.
AB  == the complete dna sequence of the streptomyces scabies (ss) secy homolog and partial sequences of adjacent upstream and downstream open reading frames (orfs)  have been determined. the nucleotide sequence of a 2-kb region predicts a polypeptide of 437 amino acids in length with homology to the secy protein family. the ss secy homolog lies upstream from a sequence that has homology to the adenylate kinase gene (adk) family. the translational stop codon of the putative secy orf overlaps the predicted start codon for the adk orf. another orf that lies upstream from the secy homolog has sequence similarity to the genes that code for the l15 r-protein. within the 243-bp intergenic region between the  l15 and secy coding sequences, the presence of a streptomycete-like promoter sequence and an 18-bp inverted repeat suggests that the secy homolog and the adjacent downstream sequences may be transcribed independently of the l15 coding  sequence. transcript analysis indicates that the secy homolog is expressed in both ss and streptomyces lividans. the proposed gene and transcript organization  of the l15-secy-adk coding regions in the ss clone resembles that of micrococcus  luteus which, like the streptomycetes, has a g+c-rich genome.

TI  == processing of chromogranin b in bovine adrenal medulla. identification of secretolytin, the endogenous c-terminal fragment of residues 614-626 with antibacterial activity.
AB  == chromogranins constitute a family of acidic soluble proteins widely distributed in endocrine cells and neurons. chromogranin a, the major soluble component in bovine adrenal medullary secretory granules in chromaffin cells, has been shown to be actively processed to peptide fragments [metz-boutigue, m. h., garcia-sablone, p., hogue-angeletti, r. & aunis, d. (1993) eur. j. biochem. 217,  247-257]. in the present paper, the structural features of the proteolytic degradation mechanism of chromogranin b/secretogranin i have been characterized with regard to the possible function of this protein as a precursor of biologically active peptides. chromogranin-b-derived fragments present in bovine  chromaffin granules were identified by microsequencing after separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography. a  similar approach was performed to characterize chromogranin-b-derived fragments released into the extracellular space from depolarized bovine cultured chromaffin cells. in chromogranin b, 18 cleavage sites were identified along the protein chain and chromogranin b/secretogranin i fragments were generated by proteolytic  attack at both the n-terminus and c-terminus. a major fragment corresponding to residues 614-626 of the c-terminal sequence, was identified in the extracellular  space; this peptide was found to share sequence and structural similarities with  the lytic domain of cecropins and, as expected from this similarity, to display potent antibacterial properties. endogenous and synthetic peptides were active on micrococus luteus, killing bacteria in the micromolar concentration range. the synthetic peptide slows the growth of bacillus megaterium and was inactive towards escherichia coli. in addition, the synthetic peptide was unable to induce hemolytic activity. this antibacterial function might be of biological significance in the neuroendocrine system of living organisms. we propose to name this peptide secretolytin.

TI  == mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  == mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (s. chatterjee, d. k. chatterjee, r. h. jani, j. blumbach, b. n. ganguli, n. klesel, m. limbert, and g. seibert, j. antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). incubation of staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. biosyntheses of dna, rna, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and d-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. thus, unlike type a lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. the formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. in contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. these data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

AB  == elongation factors g, tu, and related proteins (including lepa) form a distinct subgroup within the gtpase superfamily. this observation is based primarily upon  amino acid comparisons of the effector region (g2) of the gtp-binding domain. to  examine the functional importance of the highly conserved elongation factor g2 domain a series of chimeric proteins were constructed between escherichia coli ef-g and micrococcus luteus ef-g, and between e. coli ef-g and lepa (a protein of unknown function). the m. luteus ef-g/e. coli ef-g hybrid, m. luteus ef-g, and e. coli ef-g efficiently complemented ef-g function in an e. coli strain (pem101) harbouring a temperature-sensitive mutation in fusa (the gene encoding ef-g). a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the m. luteus ef-g and e. coli ef-g indicated that groups of divergent amino acid residues (amino acids 1-9 and 72-80) were not important for function. lepa and lepa/ef-g chimeric proteins were tested for the ability to complement ef-g function in vivo, for cross-linking to  8-azido-[gamma-32p]-gtp in vitro and for fusidic acid-dependent co-sedimentation  with 70s ribosomes. with one exception, all chimeras could be readily cross-linked to azido-gtp in an ef-g-like manner, indicating that hybrid protein  construction did not generally result in improperly folded gtp-binding domains. however, the inability of such chimeras to complement ef-g function in vivo indicates that the effector domains are not functionally interchangeable. all lepa/ef-g chimeric proteins were severely defective in fusidic acid-dependent complex formation with 70s ribosomes. a comparison of the amino acid sequences of all three proteins suggests that residues 30-33, 43-48, and 63-66 of e. coli ef-g are important for ef-g specific ribosome-associated function.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

AB  == genes from pseudomonas fluorescens, chromatium vinosum, micrococcus luteus, deinococcus radiodurans, and thermotoga maritima with homology to the escherichia coli rho gene were cloned and sequenced, and their sequences were compared with other available sequences. the species for all of the compared sequences are members of five bacterial phyla, including thermotogales, the most deeply diverged phylum. this suggests that a rho-like gene is ubiquitous in the bacteria and was present in their common ancestor. the comparative analysis revealed that  the rho homologs are highly conserved, exhibiting a minimum identity of 50% of their amino acid residues in pairwise comparisons. the atp-binding domain had a particularly high degree of conservation, consisting of some blocks with sequences of residues that are very similar to segments of the alpha and beta subunits of f1-atpase and of other blocks with sequences that are unique to rho.  the rna-binding domain is more diverged than the atp-binding domain. however, one of its most highly conserved segments includes a rnp1-like sequence, which is known to be involved in rna binding. overall, the degree of similarity is lowest  in the first 50 residues (the first half of the rna-binding domain), in the putative connector region between the rna-binding and the atp-binding domains, and in the last 50 residues of the polypeptide. since functionally defective mutants for e. coli rho exist in all three of these segments, they represent important parts of rho that have undergone adaptive evolution.

TI  == production of uv-induced frameshift mutations in vitro by dna polymerases deficient in 3'-->5' exonuclease activity.
AB  == in order to study the conversion of uv lesions into frameshift and base substitution mutations, m13mp2 phage dna was altered by the addition of extra pyrimidines, or by construction of a nonsense codon preceded by a run of pyrimidines within the beta-galactosidase complementing region. the normal sequence 5' gtc gtt tta caa 3' was changed to gtc gtt t tta caa (midt) or gtc gtt c tta caa (midc) to study frameshifts and to gtc gtt ctt taa (ochre) to study reversion of the ochre (taa) codon. escherichia coli pol i kf and t7 dna polymerase mutant enzymes devoid of 3'-->5' exonuclease activity produced uv-induced revertants at higher frequency than did their exonuclease proficient counterparts. removal of cyclobutane dimers with photolyase before in vitro synthesis did not greatly affect mutant frequency although such treatment led to  significantly increased dna synthesis by the wild-type t7 dna polymerase on uv-irradiated substrate. reversions of the in frame ochre sequence gtt ctt taa produced by the delta 28 t7 dna polymerase were mainly by base substitution in the taa codon. about half of the e. coli kf exo- enzyme ochre revertants had a tta deletion. five mutant t7 dna polymerases with varying exonuclease activity gave revertant frequencies that correlated better with published values of enzyme velocity than with exonuclease activity or with measured bypass synthesis. our data indicate that loss of proofreading activity increases the frequency of uv-induced frameshifts, but lack of such activity is not sufficient for their production. we suggest that frameshifts occur more frequently when nucleotide addition opposite the lesion is slow. the same lesion can give rise to a different spectrum of mutations depending on the polymerase.

TI  == alpha-deoxyadenosine, a major anoxic radiolysis product of adenine in dna, is a substrate for escherichia coli endonuclease iv.
AB  == oligonucleotides containing a unique alpha-deoxyadenosine or tetrahydrofuran (a model abasic site) were synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry. repair enzymes from escherichia coli, including endonucleases iii, iv, and viii, exonuclease iii, formamidopyrimidine n-glycosylase, and deoxyinosine 3'-endonuclease, as well as uv dimer n-glycosylases from t4 (den v) and micrococcus luteus, were examined for their ability to recognize alpha-deoxyadenosine and tetrahydrofuran. in agreement with prior studies, a tetrahydrofuran-containing oligonucleotide was a substrate for endonuclease iv and exonuclease iii, but not for the other repair enzymes. however, an oligonucleotide containing alpha-deoxyadenine was a substrate only for endonuclease iv. competitive inhibition studies with both substrates confirmed that the activity recognizing alpha-deoxyadenine was endonuclease iv and not a possible contaminant in the endonuclease iv preparation. using e. coli extracts,  the activity that recognized alpha-deoxyadenine was dependent on nfo, the structural gene of endonuclease iv, further substantiating that endonuclease iv is the enzyme that recognized alpha-deoxyadenine. kinetic measurements indicated  that alpha-deoxyadenosine was as good a substrate for endonuclease iv as tetrahydrofuran; the km and vmax values for both substrates were similar. using substrates that were labeled at either the 3'- or 5'-terminus, endonuclease iv was shown to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond 5' to either alpha-deoxyadenosine  or tetrahydrofuran, leaving the lesion, alpha-deoxyadenosine or tetrahydrofuran,  on the 5'-terminus of the nicked site. the ability of endonuclease iv to recognize alpha-deoxyadenosine suggests that endonuclease iv is able to recognize a new class of dna base lesions that is not recognized by other dna n-glycosylases and ap endonucleases.

AB  == synthesis and secretion of bactericidal protein (cecropin) and lysozyme were induced by soluble peptidoglycan fragments (spg) from escherichia coli in a culture of fat body from bombyx mori larvae. the rate of the secretion by fat body increased as a function of spg concentration added to the culture medium. the induction of bactericidal activity was specific for peptidoglycan of a particular structure. thus, spg from micrococcus luteus was 500-times less potent than e. coli spg, and various glucans and peptides structurally related to peptidoglycan were all ineffective as elicitor. these results support the hypothesis that bacteria invading the haemocoel have to be partially degraded to  generate peptidoglycan fragments as a signal molecule, which subsequently acts on a receptor on fat body cells and induces antibacterial protein synthesis.

'kathon' was the most active microbistatic agent showing maximal activity at low  concentration, least inactivation by organic soil and media components and the lowest level of development of bacterial resistance. it was synergistic with chlorhexidine against s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. media, formulation components and organic soil affected the performance of chlorhexidine and ctab. chlorhexidine was more broadly active than ctab but showed a greater reduction in activity in the presence of soil and engendered a greater level of bacterial resistance. it was more rapidly bactericidal to p. aeruginosa and s. marcescens than to s. aureus. stable resistance to chlorhexidine and ctab was developed by p. aeruginosa and s. marcescens, the latter showing the higher level of resistance. chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also resistant to ctab. the antiseptic formulations were more rapidly bactericidal than chlorhexidine alone but were otherwise of comparable activity. mixtures of disinfectants, in particular a combination of chlorhexidine and a preservative level of 'kathon', were more active than single disinfectants. the importance of standardization of  media and test conditions and the use of chemically defined media for accurate and reproducible in-vitro testing of disinfectant activity is emphasized. disinfection kinetics, expressed as time-kill curves, log reduction factors or decimal reduction times were shown to be valuable in differentiating microbistatic from microbicidal activity, showing the effects of dilution and soil on activity and indicating possible different mechanisms of action.

AB  == the repair ability for uv-induced damage observed for streptococcus pneumoniae proceeds through a system similar to the uvr-dependent system in escherichia coli. the dna sequence of a gene complementing uvr-402, a mutation conferring uv  sensitivity, was determined. alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed an extensive sequence homology of 55% with the uvrb protein of e. coli and 59% with the uvrb-homologous protein of micrococcus luteus. nucleotide-binding site consensus was observed. the high conservation of the uvrb-like gene among these three species suggests that the role of the uvrb protein and excision repair in general might be very important for cell survival.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == bactericidal activity of c9-deficient human serum.
AB  == escherichia coli b/sm, strain 1-1, was killed dose dependently by human hereditary c9-deficient serum (c9dhs), which was shown to contain no c9 ag by an  elisa method. on the other hand, human hereditary c7-deficient serum did not kill the bacteria under similar conditions. the bactericidal activity of c9dhs was inhibited by rabbit anti-c5 antibody but not by murine anti-c9 mab. the anti-c9 antibody decreased the bactericidal activity of normal human serum (nhs) to the level of that with c9dhs. sheep anti-human lysozyme antibody did not affect the bactericidal activity of c9dhs or nhs even when added at more than twice the concentration required to block the serum lysozyme activity on micrococcus luteus. after treatment with c9dhs and washing, surviving escherichia coli were killed by c9, but not by lysozyme, transferrin, or both. other strains of e. coli (k12 w3110, c600, and nihj) and salmonella typhimurium (strain nctc 74), all maintained in the laboratory, were also killed by c9dhs. however, pathogenic strains recently isolated from patients with traveler's diarrhea and some strains of s. typhimurium were resistant to both c9dhs and nhs, at least at the serum concentration tested. a concentration of 0.1 m tris did not increase the susceptibility of serum-resistant strains of bacteria to c9dhs, but made one strain of s. typhimurium tested susceptible to nhs, but not to c9dhs. these results clearly showed that c9dhs kills bacteria that are sensitive to nhs through activation of c up to the step of c8 in the same way that c9-deficient c  serum lyzed sensitized erythrocytes.

TI  == structure of the dnaa and dnaa-box region in the mycoplasma capricolum chromosome: conservation and variations in the course of evolution.
AB  == we have previously shown that the dnaa gene and the dnaa-box region were conserved in bacteria representative of all three major branches of the eubacterial phylogenic tree: high g + c gram+, low-g + c gram+ and gram-. in the  present work, we determined the structure of the dnaa region of mycoplasma capricolum and found that the dnaa gene and at least two other genes, rpmh and dnan, were conserved in this bacterium. an unusually high level of amino acid (aa) substitutions was observed in m. capricolum dnaa. it was the case even in those aa which were well conserved in other bacterial species. the nontranslatable region upstream from the dnaa gene was also conserved in this bacterium, as it was universally found in both gram+ and gram- bacteria. an additional nontranslatable region downstream from the dnaa gene, which is common  to gram+ bacteria, was also found in m. capricolum, consistent with the proposal  that m. capricolum is gram+ in origin. these regions were rich in a + t and contained ten dnaa-box-like sequences (9-mers that differ from ttatccaca by one or two bases).

TI  == uv endonuclease-mediated enhancement of uv survival in micrococcus luteus: evidence revealed by deficiency in the uvr homolog.
AB  == unlike its phage t4 counterpart (also known as endonuclease v), micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease (pyrimidine dimer dna glycosylase/apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease) has suffered from lack of genetic evidence to implicate it in the promotion of uv survival of the cell, i.e., mutants with its deficiency are no more uv-sensitive than the wild type. on the assumption that the contribution of  uv endonuclease is obscured by the presence of a homolog of escherichia coli uvrabc endonuclease, which has recently been identified in this bacterium, survival studies were carried out in its absence. with 254-nm uv irradiation, which generates not only pyrimidine dimers but also 6-4 photoproducts as lethal lesions, a double mutant defective in both uv endonuclease and the uvr homolog was shown to be more sensitive than a single mutant defective only in the latter, with a dose reduction factor of approximately 2 at the survival level of 37%. furthermore, molecular photosensitization, which produces only pyrimidine dimers, revealed an even greater difference in sensitivity, the dose reduction factor being about 3.4. these results indicate that the contribution to cell survival of uv endonuclease, an enzyme specific for pyrimidine dimers, is manifest if the backup by the uvr homolog is absent.

TI  == structure and function of dnaa and the dnaa-box in eubacteria: evolutionary relationships of bacterial replication origins.
AB  == dnaa protein (a trans-acting element) and its binding sequence, dnaa-box: (a cis-acting element) are two elements essential for the initiation of chromosomal  replication in escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria. recently these two elements have been found to be conserved in three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and mycoplasma capricolum) as well as in gram-negative pseudomonads. dnaa protein was also found to be essential in the initiation of the replication of the b. subtilis chromosome, and regions containing multiple repeats of dnaa-box (dnaa-box region) are found to be active  as autonomously replicating elements both in b. subtilis and pseudomonads. in this microreview we compare first the structures of these dnaa-box regions and their locations on the chromosome and then functional aspects of dnaa protein and dnaa-box regions in the initiation and regulation of chromosomal replication. from these observations we propose evolutionary relationships between replication origins of eubacteria.

TI  == protein synthesis in vitro by micrococcus luteus.
AB  == bacillus subtilis and related gram-positive bacteria which have low to moderate genomic g + c contents are unable to efficiently translate mrna derived from gram-negative bacteria, whereas escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria are able to translate mrna from both types of organisms. this phenomenon has been termed translational species specificity. ribosomes from the low-g + c-content group (low-g + c group) of gram-positive organisms (b. subtilis and relatives) lack an equivalent to escherichia ribosomal protein s1. the requirement for s1 for translation in e. coli (g. van dieijen, p. h. van knippenberg, j. van duin, b. koekman, and p. h. pouwels, mol. gen. genet. 153:75-80, 1977) and its specific role (a.r. subramanian, trends biochem. sci. 9:491-494, 1984) have been proposed. the group of gram-positive bacteria characterized by high genomic g + c content (formerly actinomyces species and relatives) contain s1, in contrast to the low-g + c group (k. mikulik, j. smardova, a. jiranova, and p. branny, eur. j. biochem.  155:557-563, 1986). it is not known whether members of the high-g + c group are translationally specific, although there is evidence that one genus, streptomyces, can express escherichia genes in vivo (m. j. bibb and s. n. cohen,  mol. gen. genet. 187:265-277, 1985; j. l. schottel, m. j. bibb, and s. n. cohen,  j. bacteriol. 146:360-368, 1981). in order to determine whether the organisms of  this group are translationally specific, we examined the in vitro translational characteristics of a member of the high-g + c group, micrococcus luteus, whose genomic g + c content is 73%. a semipurified coupled transcription-translation system of m. luteus translates escherichia mrna as well as bacillus and micrococcus mrna. therefore, m. luteus is translationally nonspecific and resembles e. coli rather than b. subtilis in its translational characteristics.

(1989) mol. gen. genet. 218, 384-389). in  order to compare the promoter selectivity of rna polymerase between m. luteus and escherichia coli, we purified the enzyme from both organisms. the sets of promoters recognized by the two rna polymerases were found to overlap partly. some, but not all, e. coli promoters were found to be correctly transcribed in vitro by m. luteus rna polymerase as well as the e. coli enzyme. one molecular species of m. luteus sigma factor, with the apparent molecular mass of 60 kda, was isolated from purified rna polymerase. by the addition of either m. luteus or e. coli core enzyme it was reconstituted into active holoenzyme. likewise, m. luteus core enzyme was reconstituted into a hybrid holoenzyme by the addition of  e. coli sigma subunit. both hybrid holoenzymes were, however, able to initiate transcription only from promoters which were recognized by both of the native holoenzymes.

AB  == dna modifications induced either by photosensitization (illumination in the presence of methylene blue) or by chemically generated singlet oxygen (thermal decomposition of an 1,4-etheno-2,3-benzodioxin) are recognized and incised by repair endonucleases present in crude bacterial cell extracts. only a small fraction of the incised modifications are sites of base loss (ap-sites) sensitive to exonuclease iii, endonuclease iv from e. coli or to the uv-endonuclease from m. luteus. cell extracts from e. coli strains overproducing or defective in endonuclease iii recognize the modifications induced by illumination in the presence of methylene blue just as well as do those from wild-type e. coli strains. this indicates that dihydropyrimidine derivatives, which are characteristic of hydroxyl radical-induced dna modifications, are absent. in contrast, most of the modifications induced are not recognized by a cell extract  from a fpg strain defective in formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase fpg protein).  furthermore, incision by a cell extract from an e. coli strain overproducing fpg  protein takes place at much lower protein concentration than with the wild-type strain. experiments with purified fpg protein confirm that this enzyme is responsible for the recognition of singlet oxygen-induced dna base modifications.

TI  == spectinomycin operon of micrococcus luteus: evolutionary implications of organization and novel codon usage.

AB  == the mechanism of action of fosmidomycin (fr-31564), a phosphonic acid containing  antibiotic, was examined against escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and other bacteria. it converted growing esch. coli cells into spheroplasts or swollen cells, but did not inhibit the enzymatic reactions of cell wall synthesis in ether-treated cells. unlike bicyclomycin, phenethyl alcohol and mitomycin c, it did not reduce the amount of envelope lipoprotein, phospholipids, or dna, but did reduce the amount of menaquinones and ubiquinones in growing esch. coli cells. it also inhibited the biosynthesis of both carotenoids and menaquinones in m. luteus cells, suggesting that inhibition of the biosynthesis of a common precursor of these isoprenoids (possibly farnesyl pyrophosphate) might be the main site of its antibacterial activity.

TI  == effect of exposure of pieris brassicae larvae to 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid on the natural antibacterial activity of serum.
AB  == larvae of the cabbage white butterfly, pieris brassicae, were reared on a semisynthetic diet with or without 20 ppm of the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-t) and using three assays the sera were  subsequently tested for natural antibacterial activity against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli k12, and micrococcus luteus. these assays showed that exposure of larvae to 2,4,5-t lowered the antibacterial activity of the serum against e. coli and m. luteus compared with control animals. spectrophotometric tests for the presence of a lysozyme-like principle in the serum also revealed similar trends with a significant loss of enzyme activity in 2,4,5-t-treated insects. overall total serum protein levels of control and 2,4,5-t-treated insects were similar, suggesting a specific effect of the herbicide on certain serum components such as lysozyme. the possible mode of action of the herbicide on production of antibacterial factors is discussed.

TI  == micrococcus luteus homolog of the escherichia coli uvra gene: identification of a mutation in the uv-sensitive mutant db7.
AB  == restriction fragments of micrococcus luteus dna containing the gene affected by a mutation in the uv-sensitive mutant db7 were cloned both from the wild type and from the mutant in an escherichia coli host-vector system. the wild-type fragment was able to reverse the multiple sensitivity of the mutant to uv, mitomycin c, and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide by a one-step transformation. determination of the nucleotide sequences revealed a potential open reading frame coding for a protein of 992 (tentative) amino acid residues, within which the db7 mutation was identified as a cg-to-ta transition causing a translation termination. the putative product of the open reading frame shares an extensive amino acid sequence homology with the e. coli uvra protein comprising 940 residues. the homology extends over the greater part of both polypeptides except for two extra  sequences of 31 and 24 amino acid residues located at the amino-terminal and in the interior, respectively, of the m. luteus protein. in the homologous region, 56.7% and 16.7% of the 933 pairs of the aligned amino acids were accounted for by conserved residues and conservative substitutions, respectively. these results indicate that the gene defined by the mutation in db7 represents a homolog of the e. coli uvra gene. hence, it has to be concluded that db7, known for its deficiency in uv endonuclease (pyrimidine dimer dna glycosylase/apurinicapyrimidinic endonuclease) activity, is a double mutant which is also defective in an enzyme complex similar to the e. coli uvrabc excinuclease.

TI  == rolling-circle replication of uv-irradiated duplex dna in the phi x174 replicative-form----single-strand replication system in vitro.
AB  == cloning of the phi x174 viral origin of replication into phage m13mp8 produced an m13-phi x174 chimera, the dna of which directed efficient replicative-form----single-strand rolling-circle replication in vitro. this replication assay was performed with purified phi x174-encoded gene a protein, escherichia coli rep helicase, single-stranded dna-binding protein, and dna polymerase iii holoenzyme. the nicking of replicative-form i (rfi) dna by gene a  protein was essentially unaffected by the presence of uv lesions in the dna. however, unwinding of uv-irradiated dna by the rep helicase was inhibited twofold as compared with unwinding of the unirradiated substrate. uv irradiation of the substrate dna caused a strong inhibition in its ability to direct dna synthesis.  however, even dna preparations that contained as many as 10 photodimers per molecule still supported the synthesis of progeny full-length single-stranded dna. the appearance of full-length radiolabeled products implied at least two full rounds of replication, since the first round released the unlabeled plus viral strand of the duplex dna. pretreatment of the uv-irradiated dna substrate with purified pyrimidine dimer endonuclease from micrococcus luteus, which converted photodimer-containing supercoiled rfi dna into relaxed, nicked rfii dna and thus prevented its replication, reduced dna synthesis by 70%. analysis of radiolabeled replication products by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography revealed that this decrease was due to a reduction in the synthesis of progeny full-length single-stranded dna. this implies that 70 to 80% of the full-length dna products produced in this system were synthesized on molecules that carried photodimers. thus, similarly to its activity on uv-irradiated single-stranded dna, dna polymerase iii holenzyme can bypass pyrimidine photodimers in the more complex replicative form --->single-strand replication, which involves, in addition to the polymerizing activity, the unwinding of the duplex by the rep helicase and the participation of a more complex multiprotein replisome.

TI  == excision-repair capacity of uv-irradiated strains of escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, estimated by plasmid recovery.
AB  == although the biological role of many bacterial repair genes is known, there is still an interest in evaluating the capacity of repair pyrimidine dimers in some  strains. for this purpose, we have developed a rapid assay. cells bearing a plasmid are uv irradiated and incubated to allow recovery. the plasmid dna is extracted, purified and treated with uv endonuclease from micrococcus luteus that specifically produces single strand breaks at the site of pyrimidine dimers. the  amount of open circular and covalently closed circular forms of the plasmid dna after treatment and post-incubation provides an estimate of the repair capability of the host strain. the wild type strain and the uvra mutant of escherichia coli  were used to adjust the assay. the lexa mutant of e. coli has been tested and its repair capability is equivalent to that of wild-type strain. the assay has been extended to streptococcus pneumoniae, which is naturally deficient in photoreactivation and sos-like functions. this strain is efficient in the repair  of pyrimidine dimers, formed after uv irradiation.

TI  == factor c from rabbit liver. a new poly(dc) and poly[d(g-c)] template-selective stimulatory protein of dna polymerases.
AB  == we have undertaken a search for mammalian dna-binding proteins that enhance the activity of dna polymerases in a template sequence-specific fashion. in this paper, we report the extensive purification and characterization of a new dna-binding protein from rabbit liver that selectively stimulates dna polymerases to copy synthetic poly[d(g-c)] and the poly(dc) strand of poly(dc).poly(dg) as well as single-stranded natural dna that contains stretches of oligo(dc). the enhancing protein, a polypeptide of 65 kda designated factor c, stimulates the copying of the two synthetic templates by escherichia coli dna polymerase i, micrococcus luteus polymerase, and eukaryotic dna polymerases alpha and beta, but not by avian myeloblastosis virus polymerase. factor c, however, does not affect  utilization by these polymerases of the poly(dg) strand of poly(dc).poly(dg), of  poly(dc) primed by oligo(dg), or of poly(da).poly(dt) and poly[d(a-t)]. with polymerase i, michaelis constants (km) of poly[d(g-c)] and of the poly(dc) strand of poly(dc).poly(dg) are decreased by factor c 37- and 4.7-fold, respectively, whereas maximum velocity (vmax) remains unchanged. by contrast, neither the km value of the poly(dg) strand of poly(dc).poly(dg) nor the vmax value with this template is altered by factor c. rates of copying of activated dna, denatured dna, or singly primed m13 dna are not affected significantly by factor c. however, primer extension analysis of the copying of recombinant m13n4 dna that contains runs of oligo(dc) within an inserted thymidine kinase gene shows that factor c increases processivity by specifically augmenting the efficiency at which polymerase i traverses the oligo(dc) stretches. direct binding of factor c  to denatured dna is indicated by retention of the protein-dna complex on columns  of deae-cellulose. binding of factor c to poly[d(g-c)] is demonstrated by the specific adsorption of the enhancing protein to columns of poly[d(g-c)]-sepharose. we propose that by binding to poly[d(g-c)] and to poly(dc).poly(dg), factor c enables tighter binding of some dna polymerases to these templates and facilitates enzymatic activity.

TI  == proximity of repair patches to persistent pyrimidine dimers in dna of normal human and xeroderma pigmentosum cells.
AB  == the proximity of repair patches to persistent pyrimidine dimers in normal human cells and xeroderma pigmentosum group c and d cells was analyzed by sequential digestion of repaired dna with micrococcus luteus uv-endonuclease and escherichia coli dna polymerase i. although this enzymatic digestion removed one-third of the pyrimidine dimers, less than 3% of the label associated with repair patches and a similar amount of uniformly labeled dna were removed. the repair patches therefore appear to be similarly distant from persistent dimers in all cell types, and, in particular, are not adjacent to unexcised dimers in xeroderma pigmentosum group d cells. a previous model that suggested that patches are inserted adjacent to dimers in xeroderma pigmentosum group d cells receives no support from these results.

AB  == restriction fragments of micrococcus luteus dna that contained the gene defined by the mutation of an excision repair-deficient mutant, uvsn1, were cloned from both the parental and mutant strains with the escherichia coli host-vector system. the wild-type fragment was able to reverse the multiple sensitivity of the mutant to ultraviolet, mitomycin c, and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide by one-step  transformation. determination of the nucleotide sequences revealed an open reading frame potentially coding for a protein of 709 amino acid residues, within which the mutation was identified as a cg----ta transition causing a change from  serine to phenylalanine. the putative product of the open reading frame showed an extensive amino acid sequence homology to the e. coli uvrb protein comprising 673 residues; the homologous region extended over the greater parts of both polypeptides, in which 55% and 17% of the 659 pairs of aligned amino acids were accounted for by conserved residues and conservative substitutions, respectively. this indicates that the gene defined by the uvsn1 mutation represents a homolog of the e. coli uvrb gene, implying the presence in m. luteus of an enzyme complex homologous to the e. coli uvrabc excinuclease.

TI  == directional mutation pressure and transfer rna in choice of the third nucleotide  of synonymous two-codon sets.
AB  == bacterial species have diverged into a series of families, some with high g + c content in their dna, and other with high a + t content, resulting, respectively, from g.c- and a.t-directional mutation pressures. such mutation pressure (g.c/a.t pressure) may be an important determinant for codon usage. it has also been suggested that trna acts as a selective constraint for determining codon usage. we have studied the relation between g.c/a.t pressure and trna constraints in determining choice of the third nucleotide of eight two-codon sets, using codon usage data obtained from protein genes in four bacterial species, mycoplasma capricolum, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and micrococcus luteus, and in liverwort (marchantia polymorpha) chloroplasts. the genomic g + c contents of these range from 25% to 74%. the results demonstrate that trna levels act additively to a.t and g.c pressure in affecting contents of a (pairing with *unn  anticodons, in which *u indicates a 2-thiouridine derivative) and c (pairing with gnn anticodons) or g (pairing with cnn anticodons), respectively, in third nucleotide positions of codons.

TI  == purification of citrobacter freundii dna gyrase and inhibition by quinolones.
AB  == dna gyrase is a bacterial enzyme which catalyzes the atp-dependent negative supercoiling of dna. it is the accepted target of quinolones. the enzyme from citrobacter freundii iid976 was purified by affinity chromatography on novobiocin-sepharose and heparin-sepharose. it had two subunits, designated a and b, which closely resembled those of the enzyme from escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus in enzymatic requirements. the inhibitory effects of the quinolones on the supercoiling activities of the enzyme correlated with their antibacterial activities. new quinolones were better inhibitors of dna gyrase than nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid. we also purified dna gyrase from a spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant (m2-5). the gyrases from iid976 and m2-5 were defined as mixtures of subunits as+bs (s, susceptible) and ar+br (r, resistant), respectively. the supercoiling activities of reconstituted ar+br and  ar+bs were more resistant to quinolones than as+bs and as+br. these findings indicate that one mechanism of c. freundii resistance against quinolones is resistance modification of the a subunit protein.

TI  == mechanism of action of micrococcus luteus gamma-endonuclease.
AB  == micrococcus luteus extracts contain gamma-endonuclease, a mg2+-independent endonuclease that cleaves gamma-irradiated dna. this enzyme has been purified approximately 1000-fold, and the purified enzyme was used to study its substrate  specificity and mechanism of action. gamma-endonuclease cleaves dna containing either thymine glycols, urea residues, or apurinic sites but not undamaged dna or dna containing reduced apurinic sites. the enzyme has both n-glycosylase activity that releases thymine glycol residues from oso4-treated dna and an associated apurinic endonuclease activity. the location and nature of the cleavage site produced has been determined with dna sequencing techniques. gamma-endonuclease cleaves dna containing thymine glycols or apurinic sites immediately 3' to the damaged or missing base. cleavage results in a 5'-phosphate terminus and a 3' baseless sugar residue. cleavage sites can be converted to primers for dna polymerase i by subsequent treatment with escherichia coli exonuclease iii. the mechanism of action of gamma-endonuclease and its substrate specificity are very  similar to those identified for e. coli endonuclease iii.

AB  == dna polymerase a (i or major) and its stimulative factor were purified from 15-20 kg wet weight of baker's yeast by several procedures, which were varied in order  to examine the possible occurrence of proteolysis. the extraction was carried out in the presence of 10 or 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf), followed by either batchwise adsorption-elution or column chromatography on deae-sepharose (rapid or time-consuming, respectively). these early steps were followed by column chromatographies on deae-, cm-, and heparin-sepharoses, phosphocellulose,  and sephacryl s-300. preparations of the polymerase obtained by all the procedures described above showed a single protein band at mr of about 145,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), unless they had been treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (me). after me treatment, however, they showed two protein bands at mr of about 145,000 and 75,000 in sds-page, except for those obtained by the procedure involving 10 mm pmsf and the batchwise adsorption-elution. all the preparations described above showed practically the same specific activity. this indicates that in intact cells, the polymerase consisted of a single peptide with mr of about 145,000, and that after cell disruption, it was artificially hydrolyzed in a limited fashion into two peptides with mr of about 75,000, which were still active and were linked to each other through a disulfide bond. preparations of the factor obtained by all the procedures described above showed a single protein band at mr of about 20,000 in  sds-page before and after me treatment. the relative activities of the purified polymerase were (100%), 123, 21, 37, 196, and 38% with native and denatured salmon sperm dna, native and denatured calf thymus dna, poly(da-dt), and poly(da).oligo(dt)10, respectively. with the addition of the purified factor, they were 173, 272, 173, 217, 173, and 247%, respectively, i.e., significantly stimulated. the purified factor also stimulated the activity of calf thymus dna polymerase alpha by 150% with denatured salmon sperm dna; km was about 5 x 10(-10)m, practically the same as that of yeast dna polymerase a. however, it hardly influenced the activities of escherichia coli enzyme i or micrococcus luteus enzyme.

TI  == selective inhibition by methoxyamine of the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity associated with pyrimidine dimer-dna glycosylases from micrococcus luteus and bacteriophage t4.
AB  == the uv endonucleases [endodeoxyribonuclease (pyrimidine dimer), ec 3.1.25.1] from micrococcus luteus and bacteriophage t4 possess two catalytic activities specific for the site of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in uv-irradiated dna: a dna glycosylase that cleaves the 5'-glycosyl bond of the dimerized pyrimidines and an apurinic/apyrimidinic (ap) endonuclease that thereupon incises the phosphodiester bond 3' to the resulting apyrimidinic site. we have explored the potential use of methoxyamine, a chemical that reacts at neutral ph with ap sites in dna, as a selective inhibitor of the ap endonuclease activities residing in the m. luteus and t4 enzymes. the presence of 50 mm methoxyamine during incubation of uv- (4 kj/m2, 254 nm) treated, [3h]thymine-labeled poly(da).poly(dt) with either enzyme  preparation was found to protect completely the irradiated copolymer from endonucleolytic attack at dimer sites, as assayed by yield of acid-soluble radioactivity. in contrast, the dimer-dna glycosylase activity of each enzyme remained fully functional, as monitored retrospectively by release of free thymine after either photochemical- (5 kj/m2, 254 nm) or photoenzymic- (escherichia coli photolyase plus visible light) induced reversal of pyrimidine dimers in the uv-damaged substrate. our data demonstrate that the inhibition of the strand-incision reaction arises because of chemical modification of the ap sites and is not due to inactivation of the enzyme by methoxyamine. our results,  combined with earlier findings for 5'-acting ap endonucleases, strongly suggest that methoxyamine is a highly specific inhibitor of virtually all ap endonucleases, irrespective of their modes of action, and may therefore prove useful in a wide variety of dna repair studies.

AB  == the mutagenicity of the dna base o-alkylation adduct, o4-ethylthymine, specifically incorporated into the plasmid vector puc8 at the unique sali and hincii recognition sites, was studied in vivo. escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and amv dna polymerases catalyze the incorporation of o4-ethyltmp against  template adenine and guanine residues, resulting in dna sequence alteration during subsequent replication in the host e. coli k-12 strain jm83. the greatest  mutation frequency was observed with error-prone amv dna polymerase. high levels  of cognate restriction endonuclease-resistant mutant plasmid isolates were obtained by gap replication repair in the presence of o4-ethylttp. the yields of  mutant isolates were dependent upon the relative concentration of the competing pyrimidine deoxynucleoside triphosphates, ttp and dctp, in the misreplication reaction. repair of incorporated o4-ethyltmp of plasmid dna by in vitro treatment with specific alkyltransferase, prior to transformation in the host, effectively  increases the mutagenic efficiency of the adduct. the results obtained are consistent with the high miscoding potential o4-ethylthymine observed in in vitro studies and its ability to base-pair with noncomplementary guanine residues in dna.

AB  == to extend our knowledge of the excision repair system in mammalian cells we have  focussed on the isolation of genes and proteins involved in this process. for the purification and characterization of human repair proteins the microneedle injection assay technique is utilized. this system is based on the transient correction of the excision repair defect of xeroderma pigmentosum (xp) fibroblasts (scored as increase of ultraviolet (u.v.)-induced unscheduled dna synthesis (uds) upon microinjection of crude extracts from complementing xp or normal cells. specific correction is observed in fibroblasts of all (9) excision-deficient xp complementation groups. the xp-a and g correcting factors were found to be proteins and several purification steps (including (nh4)2so4 fractionation, chromatography of phosphocellulose, heparin and u.v.-irradiated dna-cellulose) have been worked out for the xp-a correcting protein. the microinjection system was also used for the introduction of (partially) purified  repair enzymes of lower organisms. micrococcus luteus endonuclease and bacteriophage t4 endonuclease v were able to correct all xp complementation groups tested, in marked contrast to the more sophisticated escherichia coli uvrabc complex injected with uvrd. photoreversal of dimers could be registered after introduction of the yeast photoreactivating enzyme in repair-competent, xp-variant, xp-c and xp-i fibroblasts (monitored as decrease of (residual) uds).  remarkably, no effect was noticed in xp-a, d, e and h, suggesting that something  prevents dimers in these cells from being monomerized by the injected enzyme. using dna-mediated gene transfer we have cloned a human gene (designated ercc-1)  that compensates for the excision defect of the u.v. and mitomycin c-sensitive chinese hamster ovary cell (cho) mutant 43-3b (complementation group 2). characterization of this gene and its cdna revealed the following features: (1) ercc-1 corrects the full spectrum of repair deficiencies in mutants of complementation group 2. no correction is observed in mutants of the other cho complementation groups. (2) the ercc-1 gene has a size of 15 x 10(3) base-pairs (bp) and consists of 10 exons, one of which appears to be differentially spliced. (3) it encodes two largely identical mrnas, which differ in the presence or absence of a 72 bp coding exon, situated in the 3' half of the mrna. only the cdna of the large transcript is able to confer repair proficiency to 43-3b cells. no effect of u.v. treatment is found at the level of ercc-1 transcription in hela cells.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == analysis of cell division gene ftsz (sulb) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the ftsz (sulb) gene of escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. the presence of an ftsz gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of southern blot and western blot analyses. southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests  revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family enterobacteriaceae and from pseudomonas aeruginosa and agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an e. coli ftsz probe. genomic dna from more distantly related bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. western blot analysis, with anti-e. coli ftsz antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. several of the enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the e. coli ftsz gene. these transformed strains, shigella sonnei, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter  aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the ftsz protein and to produce minicells. analysis of [35s]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. this demonstrated that the e. coli  ftsz gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that  these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.

AB  == the enzyme phenylacetyl-coa: 6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase of penicillium chrysogenum was evaluated by direct bioassay against micrococcus luteus atcc 9341. the enzyme required dithiothreitol, was inactivated by 0.2 mm hg2+ (100%), zn2+ (80%), cu2+ (60%), 1 mm n-ethylmaleimide (80%), and showed maximal catalytic activity at ph 8.4 and 20 degrees c. the v50 values for phenylacetyl-coa and 6-aminopenicillanic acid were 0.55 mm and 1 microm, respectively. when octanoyl-coa was employed as substrate similar results were obtained. in both cases the product generated showed strong antibacterial activity which was quickly lost when incubation was carried out with beta-lactamase. reactions performed in the presence of escherichia coli penicillin acylase did not generated active products when phenylacetyl-coa was the substrate; they did with octanoyl-coa. time-course experiments revealed that  the highest enzyme levels are found in 36 hours mycelium and remained almost constant from 48 to 96 hours; thereafter the level of the enzyme slowly decreased.

AB  == new quinolone antimicrobial agents (racemic, (1's,2'r)- and (1'r,2's)-6-fluoro-7-(1-piperazinyl)-1-(2'-trans-phenyl-1'-cyclopropyl)- 1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids) were synthesized, and their in vitro antimicrobial potencies and spectra were determined. as compared to their conceptual parents, these agents retained a considerable amount of the antimicrobial potency and spectra of ciprofloxacin and of 6-fluoro-1-phenyl-7-(1-piperazinyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxy lic acid against gram-positives. gram-negatives were considerably less sensitive. the (-)-(1's,2'r) analogue was the more potent of the enantiomers, but the degree of  chiral discrimination by most bacteria was only 4-fold. the 4-fold chiral discrimination was observed also using purified dna gyrase obtained from micrococcus luteus, whereas the two enantiomers were essentially equiactive against the enzyme derived from escherichia coli. these results confirm that there is a substantial degree of bulk tolerance available at n-1 of quinolone antimicrobial agents and suggest that electronic factors controlled by substitution at that site are of considerable importance. on the other hand, chiral recognition brought about by attachment of optically active groups to the  n-1 position in these derivatives is relatively small.

TI  == bifilar enzyme-sensitive sites in ultraviolet-irradiated dna are indicative of closely opposed cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers.
AB  == incubation of uv-irradiated dna with pyrimidine dimer-dna glycosylase in cell-free lysates prepared from micrococcus luteus results in the appearance of double-strand breaks. it has previously been assumed that such double-strand breaks result from cleavage at closely opposed dimers. we have used hybrid molecules of bacteriophage t7 dna comprised of two unirradiated strands, two uv-irradiated strands, or one unirradiated and one uv-irradiated strand to test this hypothesis. bifilar cleavage was observed only with molecules consisting of  two irradiated strands and no bifilar cleavage was observed after the monomerization of pyrimidine dimers by enzymatic photoreactivation. our results indicate that at least 80% of the double-strand breaks result from cleavage at closely opposed dimers and that the induction of dimers in one strand does not influence the induction of dimers at closely opposed positions in the complementary strand of a dna double helix.

TI  == defence reactions of glossina morsitans morsitans against different species of bacteria and trypanosoma brucei brucei.
AB  == tsetse flies, glossina morsitans morsitans, fed on rats infected with trypanosoma brucei brucei showed wide fluctuations in total and differential haemocyte counts. similar fluctuations occurred in controls fed on non-infected rats and also between the two groups without showing any difference which could be attributed to the infection. trypanosome infection of the tsetse haemocoel occurred in 16.25% of the flies, starting from the second day after feeding on the infected rats, but salivary glands and proboscis became infected only after the eleventh day. about 2% of bloodstream forms of t. b. brucei injected into tsetse haemocoels completed their developmental cycle successfully. injection of  tsetse homogenates into teneral g. m. morsitans prior to exposure to trypanosome-infected feed increased t. b. brucei infections in the flies significantly. injection of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter calcoaceticus into tsetse induced a remarkable increase in two pre-existing haemolymph proteins with molecular weights of about 70 and 17 kilodaltons, while live bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus induced a very weak response or sometimes none at all. t. b. brucei also failed to induce any increase in these proteins. inoculation of g. m. morsitans with live e. coli und  t. b. brucei prior to feeding on trypanosome-infected rats had no effect on the salivary gland and proboscis infection rates by t. b. brucei. injection of live t. b. brucei into the haemocoels of tsetse caused no change in total haemocyte counts, but the trypanosomes disappeared from the haemolymph so rapidly that by 48 h post-injection, only about 1% were left.

TI  == higher pyrimidine dimer yields in skin of normal humans with higher uvb sensitivity.
AB  == we have measured uvb (280-320 nm)-induced dna damage in skin of individuals with  different sensitivities to uvb irradiation as measured by minimal erythema dose (med). the dna damage was susceptible to cleavage by micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease, which recognizes pyrimidine dimers in dna. an alkaline agarose gel  electrophoresis method was used to quantitate the number of m. luteus uv endonuclease-sensitive sites in nonradioactive dna from skin biopsies of 7 individuals irradiated with uvb (0-180 mj x cm-2). the production of sites correlated well with med (correlation coefficient = 0.78). the slope of the dose  response curve for the most uvb-sensitive individual (med = 24 mj x cm-2) and for the least uvb-sensitive individual (med = 146 mj x cm-2) were 11.5 x 10(-4) and 2.6 x 10(-4) sites per 1000 bases per mj x cm-2, respectively. the uvb-induced dna damage was determined to be pyrimidine dimers by its susceptibility to cleavage by m. luteus uv endonuclease and its photoreactivability by escherichia  coli photoreactivating enzyme.

TI  == quantitation of carcinogen-induced dna damage and repair in human cells with the  uvr abc excision nuclease from escherichia coli.
AB  == recent studies by others have shown that the endonuclease complex coded for by the uvra, uvrb and uvrc genes of escherichia coli (uvr abc excision nuclease) can incise dna containing a variety of 'bulk-type' lesions, such as those resulting from u.v. light, (+/-)-7 alpha,8 beta-dihydroxy-9 alpha,10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (anti-bpde), and n-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene. using partially purified uvr abc excision nuclease, we have quantitated the number of endonuclease sensitive sites (ess) in purified dna isolated from human fibroblasts treated with u.v. light or bpde. the number of ess/10(8) daltons of dna were calculated from the number average mol. wt. of the dna as determined by sedimentation in alkaline sucrose gradients. the  number of endonuclease sites increased linearly with increasing doses of either u.v. light or bpde. the uvr abc excision nuclease was able to incise a majority of the bpde-dna adducts. xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts, complementation group a (xp12be) had 20-25% more ess at each dose than the bpde-treated normal (hsbp) cells. cells treated with 4 microm bpde and allowed 12 h of incubation to perform excision repair showed removal of 60% of the initial number of ess from hsbp dna  and 40% of the ess from xp-a dna. beyond 12 h xp12be cells lost no additional ess while hsbp cells continued to lose ess, although at a slower rate, until at 48 h  only 22% of the initial ess remained. in cells treated with 10 j/m2 of u.v. light, the uvr abc excision nuclease detected 60% of the sites recognized by the  pyridimine dimer specific micrococcus luteus glycosylase/apyrimidinic endonuclease. these results demonstrate the potential use of the uvr abc excision nuclease in a quantitative assay for determining the number of carcinogen-induced lesions in human dna.

TI  == cloning of micrococcus luteus 3-methyladenine-dna glycosylase genes in escherichia coli.
AB  == the 3-methyladenine-dna glycosylase (m3adg) excises 3-methyladenine (m3a) residues formed in dna after treatment with alkylating agents. in escherichia coli, the repair of this type of damage depends on the products of the genes taga and/or alka, which code for m3adg i (20 kda) and ii (30 kda), respectively. the taga- and alka--single mutants are sensitive to alkylating agents, the double mutant much more so. we have cloned two genes of micrococcus luteus that can partly substitute the function of the e. coli taga- and alka- genes. an m. luteus genome bank was made by shotgun cloning of ecori + bamhi-digested dna into pbr322. two hybrid plasmids were identified that confer methylmethane sulfonate (mms) resistance to the taga- ada+ mutant and a capacity to reactivate mms-treated bacteriophage lambda. each hybrid plasmid directed the synthesis of 21-kda m3adg in e. coli taga- ada-, which were not inhibited by 4 mm m3a. however, the restriction maps of the two cloned genes were different, and they showed no sequence homology as judged by the lack of cross hybridization.

TI  == the repair of pyrimidine dimers via a dna-glycosylase mechanism.
AB  == the "uv endonuclease" isolated either from m. luteus or bacteriophage t4 infected e. coli (the denv gene product) consists of two enzymatic activities on a single  polypeptide chain: a pyrimidine dimer-dna glycosylase and an ap endonuclease. the repair of pyrimidine dimers by this enzyme is initiated by the cleavage of the n-glycosylic bond of the 5' pyrimidine of the dimer that leaves the cyclobutane dimer still attached to the dna through the n-glycosylic bond of the 3' pyrimidine of the dimer. this reaction results in the formation of an apyrimidinic site in the dna. the second step in this repair pathway is the endonucleolytic cleavage of the dna 3' to the ap site by the associated ap endonuclease. as a result, the nicked dna contains dna damage on both sides of the incision site: an apyrimidinic moiety on the 3' end and a thymine-thymidylate dimer on the 5' end. the enzymes prefer double stranded dna over single stranded  dna, and thymine over cytosine at the 5' position of the dimer. the ap endonuclease activity prefers the ap site created by the pyrimidine dimer-dna glycosylase on uv irradiated dna over either apurinic or apyrimidinic dna. this repair mechanism appears to be operative in vivo since dna intermediates containing thymine-thymidylate dimer sites have been detected in uv irradiated t4 infected e. coli and in uv irradiated m. luteus. the cloned denv gene partially complements the uv repair deficient uvr a, b, c strains of e. coli.

TI  == template properties of ultraviolet-irradiated poly(dc) replicated by e. coli dna  polymerase i: indication for a role of apyrimidinic-sites in uv-induced mutagenesis.
AB  == ultraviolet irradiation alters the template properties of poly(dc) when replicated by escherichia coli dna polymerase i. these effects are due to base modifications. some of them are identified as apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (ap-sites) by their sensitivity to ap-endonuclease b purified from micrococcus luteus, and their template properties. the rate of formation of ap-sites in poly(dc) is estimated at 3 x 10(-7) site per nucleotide per j.m-2. exposure of supercoiled or relaxed pbr322 dna to uv light results also in the formation of sites sensitive to ap-endonuclease b. in this case, the rate of formation of ap-sites is the same in relaxed or supercoiled dna: 0.3 x 10(-7) site per nucleotide per j.m-2. the apyrimidinic sites are generated through the processing of an ultraviolet induced primary lesion. we suggest that this lesion is cytosine hydrate by its rate of decay and preferential formation in single stranded dna. our results suggest that ap-sites might be a minor pathway leading to uv-induced  mutagenesis.

AB  == the system previously used to study recombination of nonreplicating uv-irradiated phage lambda dna was adapted to study uv repair. irradiated phages infected undamaged homoimmune lysogens. pyrimidine dimer content (by treatment with micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease and alkaline sucrose sedimentation) and a biological activity endpoint (infectivity in transfection of uvrb reca recb spheroplasts) were followed. unless room light was excluded during dna extraction procedures, photoreactivation (phr function) was significant. in uvr delta phr bacteria, repair, by both assays, was very low but not zero. even when light was  totally excluded, phr function appeared to play a role in uvr-mediated excision repair: both dimer removal and restoration of infectivity were two to five times  as efficient in uvr+ phr+ bacteria as in uvr+ delta phr bacteria. similarly, uv-irradiated phages plated with higher efficiencies on phr+ than delta phr bacteria even under totally dark conditions. in uvr phr+ repressed infections, removal of dimers from nonreplicating dna did not increase infectivity as much as in uvr+ infections, suggesting a requirement for repair of nondimer photoproducts by the uvrabc system.

AB  == in an effort to search for good methods for the enzymatic synthesis of polynucleotide analogs with antitemplate activity, 5-methylthiouridine-5'-diphosphate (ms5udp) has been synthesized and investigated as a substrate for polynucleotide phosphorylase. while ms5udp was polymerized at  a very low rate to give a 6% yield of polynucleotides by the polynucleotide phosphorylase of micrococcus luteus, it was utilized more efficiently by the corresponding enzyme of escherichia coli resulting in a 15% yield of poly (5-methylthiouridylic) acid. results of the co-polymerization of ms5udp and udp revealed that the ratio of 5-methylthiouridylate to uridylate residues in the polynucleotide product was lower than the ratio of ms5udp to udp in the substrate mixture. the 5-methylthio group conferred only minute changes on the conformation of the modified polyuridylic acid, and the complexes formed between poly-(5-methylthiouridylic) acid and poly(adenylic) acid possessed slightly higher tm values than did the unmodified counterparts. poly(5-methylthiouridylic) acid was a potent inhibitor of calf thymus dna polymerase alpha.

AB  == incubation of dna-dependent rna polymerase from micrococcus luteus (gram-positive) with the plasmid pbr322 under transcription conditions in vitro leads to the formation of a rather short-chained rna. this transcript is initiated at the same site on pbr322 as rna i, a defined escherichia coli rna polymerase product. m. luteus rna polymerase initiates transcription at the rna i site much more efficiently than the e. coli enzyme, using either a plasmid preparation of pbr322 or an appropriate linear restriction fragment as template.  in the latter case, cleavage of the restriction fragment 24 or 71 nucleotides (but not 91 nucleotides) upstream of the initiation site destroys template activity. by sequence analysis it was determined that the 3' terminus of the m. luteus rna polymerase transcription product is identical with that known for rna  i. moreover, in agreement with synthesis of rna i by e. coli rna polymerase in vitro, termination by the m. luteus enzyme is also a stutter process characterized by the same dependence on the available utp concentration. these observations lead to the hypothesis that termination by eubacterial rna polymerases might not be species-specific.

AB  == primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. after sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination  of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria escherichia coli k 12 and staphylococcus aureus sg 511. microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. the following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with candida albicans). 2. cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. only one semen sample was  contaminated with bacteria (staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and streptococcus  nonhaemolyticus). non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.

TI  == [effect of antibiotic al-87 on the fatty acid composition of microorganisms in different taxonomic groups].
AB  == the effect of antibiotic a1-87 on the fatty acid composition of s. aureus 209, e. coli o26 and m. luteus 169 significantly differing in this property was studied.  the sub-bacteriostatic doses of the preparation induced the appearance of unsaturated fatty acids in s. aureus 209. these acids were not detected in the control cultures. they also significantly increased the content of the saturated  branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms in this culture and decreased the content of the fatty acid of the same type with 19 carbon atoms. in e. coli o25 there was an almost two-fold increase in the content of the unsaturated straight  chain fatty acids with a respective decrease in the content of cyclopropanoic acid and a markedly pronounced decrease in the content of nonadecanoic acid. in m. luteus 169 the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms increased, while the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids  (c16:1, c18:1) decreased, the content of hexadecanoic acid being decreased almost two times. according to the present status the differences in the fatty acid composition of the above organisms are interpreted as one of the mechanisms increasing the membrane permeability.

TI  == ensifer adhaerens predatory activity against other bacteria in soil, as monitored by indirect phage analysis.
AB  == an indirect phage analysis procedure was used to detect and follow the activity of the bacterial predator ensifer adhaerens in situ in natural soil. the soil was percolated with an aqueous suspension of washed bacterial host cells so that the  e. adhaerens cells naturally present in the soil would multiply in response to the host cells. the natural phage development which ensued against these multiplying e. adhaerens cells in the soil was then monitored by noting plaques which developed when the percolation fluid was plated with laboratory strains of  e. adhaerens on laboratory media. the activities of the other members of the predation system that includes e. adhaerens (streptomyces sp. strain 34 and a myxobacter) could not be monitored directly by phage analysis because phage were  not found for them. indirect monitoring was possible, however, because they were  susceptible to attack by e. adhaerens. in general, the results were in agreement  with previous observations by other methods of the predation sequence. e. adhaerens attacked micrococcus luteus, streptomyces sp. strain 34, and the myxobacter but did not attack several other possible species of hosts. it also did not respond to percolation of the soil with various nutrient solutions. e. adhaerens phage activity was not present in half of the soils percolated with m.  luteus cells. this seemed to reflect too great a phage-host specificity for the technique as regards these soils, because e. adhaerens-like bacteria other than the strains used for plaquing were present in at least some of these soils. although e. adhaerens did not attack escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa in soil, there was an overproduction of e. adhaerens phage if these bacteria were percolated simultaneously with m. luteus cells. the possibility is discussed that this represents an activation by m. luteus (or by a heat-extractable factor from  it) of other bacterial predators that attack e. coli or p. aeruginosa and that these predators subsequently are themselves attacked by e. adhaerens.

TI  == flow dichroism evidence for tilting of the bases when dna is in solution.
AB  == flow linear dichroism studies of dnas from clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and micrococcus luteus are extended into the vacuum uv region to 175 nm. the short-wavelength pi pi region shows a less negative reduced linear dichroism  than the well-studied long-wavelength pi pi region. these results are independent of the type of dna and the concentration of salt over the range 0.001 to 1.0 m. this proves that the bases are not perpendicular to the flow orientation. assuming that the dna tends to align along its helix axis, the largest angle that the bases can make with the helix axis is 73 +/- 3 degrees.

AB  == heat treatment of poly(deoxycytidylic acid)-[poly(dc)] induces the formation of dump residues, which code for damp when replicated by escherichia coli dna polymerases i and iii. the specificity of dump coding properties is indicated by  the quantitative relation between the damp incorporated and the frequency of dump residues in the heat-treated poly(dc). the damp incorporation is prevented by preincubation of uracil containing poly(dc) with uracil-dna glycosylase. the excision of uracil by uracil-dna glycosylase leads to the formation of apyrimidinic sites (ap sites), which are barely replicated in vitro under physiological conditions. however, the alteration of e. coli dna polymerase i fidelity of replication by mn2+ greatly stimulates the replication of ap sites. there is a preferential incorporation of damp, as compared to dtmp, opposite the  ap sites. the damp incorporation is prevented by preincubation of poly(dc) containing ap sites with micrococcus luteus ap endonuclease b. the results show a close association between dna repair by base excision and the prevention of mutagenic processes in vitro. furthermore, since the alteration of dna polymerase fidelity allows some replication of the noncoding dna lesion (ap site), this could imply a role in sos-induced mutagenesis in vivo.

TI  == antibacterial and antimycotic effect of a newly discovered secretion from larvae  of an endoparasitic insect, pimpla turionellae l. (hym.).
AB  == the larvae of pimpla turionellae, that develop in pupae of various lepidoptera, discharged through their anus up to 8 microliters/h of a hyaline liquid, which is termed "anal secretion". it exerted a strong bacteriostatic effect on enterobacter cloacae, a highly virulent intestinal microorganism isolated from the midgut of the host pupa, pieris brassicae. growth inhibition of escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas phaseolicola was also evident, but less  pronounced. inhibition depended upon the concentration of the anal secretion. this was also true regarding the effect on growth of beauveria bassiana, a fungus pathogenic on insects. the antimycotic action of the anal secretion was less effective against chaetomium pululiferum, a soil-inhabiting fungus. growing hyphae of b. bassiana were malformed, exhibiting the so-called "curling effect",  when treated with anal secretion. parenteral injection of a low dose of enterobacter cloacae resulted in 100% mortality of non parasitized pupae of pieris brassicae; however, simultaneous injection of 3 microliters of anal secretion resulted in higher survival.

AB  == poly(7-deazaguanylic acid) was enzymatically synthesized by the polymerization of 7-deazaguanosine 5'-diphosphate with polynucleotide phosphorylase from micrococcus luteus in high yield. the homopolymer showed a similar thermal and total hypochromicity to poly(g) at the long wavelength absorption maximum. no sigmoid melting profile was observed for poly(c7g) as is found for poly(g), implying a single-stranded structure in aqueous solution. from the circular dichroism spectra it can be concluded that the 7-deazapurine nucleotide is much more flexible than the purine nucleotide. in analogy to poly(g), the homopolymer  poly(c7g) forms a 1:1 complex with poly(c) under neutral conditions, melting at a similar temperature to the poly(g) complex. however, at ph 2.5, where a poly(g) x 2poly(c) complex is observed, poly(c7g) still binds only one poly(c) strand. this is due to the lack of n-7 in poly(c7g), not allowing hoogsteen base pair formation, which occurs with poly(g). rnase t1 cleaves poly(c7g), indicating that n-7 of guanosine is not a requirement for nucleotide binding to the enzyme, as has been suggested. because of the single-stranded structure of poly(c7g), the polynucleotide chain is rapidly hydrolyzed by the single-strand-specific nuclease s1, whereas multistranded poly(g) is completely resistant.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristic of insoluble alkylpyridinium iodide.
AB  == insoluble and soluble alkylpyridinium iodides (c8 to c18) were synthesized. the insoluble agents were quaternized 4-vinylpyridine-divinylbenzene copolymers. the  insoluble agent [c12(50)] that contained 50% divinylbenzene and had a c12 alkyl chain was selected as the most suitable insoluble agent. c12(50) showed poor durability of the antibacterial activity, but c12(50), which had lost the activity, was refreshed by washing with ethanol. this washing became ineffective  after a few cycles of antibacterial treatment and refreshment. such c12(50) recovered the activity upon 1.0 n naoh treatment. the antibacterial activity of c12(50) depended on its surface area. it showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and also showed activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. but the activities of c12(50) and laurylpyridinium iodide solution were different against some microbes. the antibacterial activities of the agents were investigated against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus under various conditions. the activity of c12(50) was higher at a higher temperature or at a lower cell concentration. the activity of c12(50) decreased on addition of nacl, glucose, or bovine albumin to the cell suspension or in 0.01 m sodium-potassium phosphate buffer. c12(50) showed less activity when cells were mixed with dead cells or the supernatant of dead cells killed in an autoclave. the mode of action of the laurylpyridinium iodide solution against e. coli and m. luteus was similar to that of c12(50) except for the influence of e. coli cell concentration.

TI  == characterization of polynucleotide phosphorylase from micrococcus luteus and isolation of the 13,000 base poly(a) product of the polymerization reaction.
AB  == a new purification procedure for polynucleotide phosphorylase from freeze-dried micrococcus luteus cells gives approximately 20% yield of nearly homogeneous, primer-independent enzyme which is free of nucleic acid. the physicochemical properties of m. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase are similar to those previously described for the enzyme from escherichia coli in terms of mr, subunit structure, and amino acid composition. the purified enzyme appears to be a trimer composed of three identical subunits (mr 92,000), but it probably does not exist  as such in the cell. ferguson plot analyses of enzyme in cell extracts indicate that prior to purification the enzyme exists in oligomeric forms characterized by both higher charge and greater mr. changes in size and charge of oligomers which  occur during purification are probably due to the dissociation of proteins and/or nucleic acids. dissociation of the oligomers is achieved by dilution and electrophoresis, but reassociation does not occur after concentration. the poly(a) product of the initial polymerization stages migrates as a single band on both nondenaturing and urea-agarose gels. it is 13,000 +/- 2,000 nucleotides long, as measured by electron microscopy, and 8,000 nucleotides long by gel electrophoretic analysis. this poly(a) product remains bound to the enzyme after  synthesis, yet can be easily obtained free of protein by proteinase k digestion.

TI  == evidence that dimers remaining in preinduced escherichia coli b/r hcr+ become insensitive after dna replication to the extract from micrococcus luteus.
AB  == in escherichia coli b/r her+ irradiated with two separate fluences, dimer excision is prematurely interrupted. the present study was designed to follow tha fate of dimers remaining unexcised. the results imply that these dimers (or distortions containing dimers) are transformed on replication from the state of sensitivity to the state of insensitivity to endonuclease from micrococcus luteus. this conclusion is based on the following findings: (a) dimers were radiochromatographically detectable in dna replicated after uv, which indicated that they were tolerated on replication. (b) similar amounts of dimers were detected radiochromatographically both in dna remaining unreplicated and dna twice replicated after uv, this along with the low transfer of parental label into daughter dna, indicated that dimers remained in situ in parental chains. (c) immediately after uv, all parental dna contained numerous sites sensitive to the  extract from m. luteus. 2 h after uv, a portion of parental dna still contained a number of endonuclease-sensitive (es) sites, while another portion of parental dna and all daughter dna were free of es sites. (d) the occurrence of parental dna free of es sites was not temporally correlated with dimer excision, but with  the first round of dna replication. (e) the amount of dna free of es sites corresponded to the amount of replicated dna. (f) separation of replicated and unreplicated dna, and detection of es sites in both portions separately showed that the replicated dna was almost free of es sites, whereas unreplicated dna contained a number of such sites.

TI  == early steps of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers by the micrococcus luteus endonuclease. a three-step incision model.
AB  == the early steps of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are investigated. it is demonstrated that the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease associated with the micrococcus luteus uv-specific endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of the deoxyribose leaving a 3' hydroxy terminus and a 5' phosphoryl terminus. this nick is not a substrate for t4 polynucleotide ligase. the 3' base-free deoxyribose terminus is not a substrate for either the polymerase or the 3' to 5' exonuclease activities of escherichia coli dna polymerase i. however, the 3' terminus of the nick is converted to a substrate for dna polymerization by the action of a 5' apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease. a three-step model for the incision step of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers is presented.

TI  == strand cleavage at psoralen adducts and pyrimidine dimers in dna caused by interaction between semi-purified uvr+ gene products from escherichia coli.
AB  == partially purified extracts of escherichia coli containing either uvra+ or a mixture of uvrb+ and uvrc+ gene products were tested for an endonuclease activity on dna treated with 8-methoxypsoralen plus 360-nm light. neither of these fractions was active alone. the combined fractions, however, caused extensive strand cleavage of the psoralen-treated dna. the endonuclease activity was dependent upon addition of atp and mg2+ to the reaction mixtures, and hence appeared similar to the uv-endonuclease activity previously shown to be reconstituted from the same fractions. it is concluded that the uvr+ gene products in these fractions interact to cause breakage of both psoralen-treated and uv-irradiated dna. an examination of the dose-dependence relationship of the  break formation in psoralen-treated dna revealed that the enzyme acts upon psoralen mono-adducts. by varying the experimental conditions to increase the ratio of interstrand cross-links to mono-adducts it was found that the enzyme also acts upon cross-links, but with lower efficiency than for mono-adducts. further studies of break formation in uv-irradiated dna showed that elimination of pyrimidine dimers by treatment with photoreactivating enzyme in the light resulted in a loss of endonuclease-sensitive sites. this shows directly that pyrimidine dimers are the lesions recognized by the complemented uvr+ gene products in uv-irradiated dna. for comparison, another endonuclease acting at pyrimidine dimers in dna, the micrococcus luteus uv-endonuclease, was also tested with psoralen-treated dna, but no activity was observed. this and other data indicate that the repair endonuclease encoded by the uvr+ genes in e. coli is basically different from the other dimer-specific endonucleases previously characterized.

TI  == e. coli and m. luteus dna topoisomerase i can catalyze catenation of decatenation of double-stranded dna rings.
AB  == escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus dna topoisomerase i are found to promote  catenation of double-stranded dna rings. at low dna concentration dimeric catenanes are the major catenated products; at high dna concentration or when spermidine is present, catenanes containing more than two rings are formed. there is no requirement of extensive sequence homology between the conponent rings forming a catenane; dimeric catenanes between pseudomonas phage pm2 dna and e. coli plasmid pbr322 are readily formed. the formation of a dimeric catenane by these type i topoisomerases, however, requires the presence of at least one preexisting single-chain scission in one of the two component rings. this is in contrast to the cases with the type ii dna topoisomerases which can form catenanes made of covalently closed rings only. the catenanes formed by the type  i enzymes can be unlinked by the same enzymes, or by dna gyrase, a type ii enzyme, upon dilution of the isolated catenanes. the catenation and decatenation  of duplex dna rings adds a fourth type of reaction promoted by these type i dna topoisomerases to the three reported previously: relaxation of superhelical dna,  interconversion between single-stranded dna rings with and without knots and the  intertwining of single-stranded dna rings of complementary sequences into a covalently closed duplex ring with a high linking number. all four topoisomerization reactions involve the crossing of one dna strand through a transient break of another dna strand. the new reaction reported here suggests that such a crossover event might not require pairing of complementary nucleotide sequences.

AB  == endonuclease v of bacteriophage t4 has been described as an enzyme, coded for by  the denv gene, that incises uv-irradiated dna. it has recently been proposed that incision of irradiated dna by this enzyme and the analogous "correndonucleases" i and ii of micrococcus luteus requires the sequential action of a pyrimidine dimer-specific dna glycosylase and an apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease. in support of this two-step mechanism, we found that our preparations of t4 endonuclease v contained a dna glycosylase activity that produced alkali-labile sites in irradiated dna and an apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease activity that converted these sites to nicks. both activities could be detected in the presence of 10 mm edta. in experiments designed to determine which of the activities is coded by the denv gene, we found that the glycosylase was more heat labile in extracts of escherichia coli infected with either of two thermosensitive denv mutants than in extracts of cells infected with wild-type t4. in contrast, apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease activity was no more heat labile in extracts of the former than in extracts of the latter. our results indicate that the denv  gene codes for a dna glycosylase specific for pyrimidine dimers.

TI  == evolutionary relationship between halobacterium cutirubrum and eukaryotes determined by use of aminoacyl-trna synthetases as phylogenetic probes.
AB  == the cross-species reactivities between trnas and aminoacyl-trna synthetases have  been employed as a basis to estimate the relatedness of various prokaryotes to the eukaryotes. the trna of halobacterium cutirubrum, unlike that of other prokaryotes tested, including agrobacterium tumefaciens, arthrobacter luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus stearothermophilus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, myxococcus xanthus, rhodopseudomonas spheroides, and thermus aquaticus, was found to share with yeast, rat liver, and wheat germ trna a distinct preference for aminoacylation by eukaryotic synthetases from yeast as opposed to  prokaryotic synthetases from either e. coli or r. spheroides. these results suggest that phylogenetically h. cutirubrum is more closely related to the eukaryotes than to the eubacteria.

TI  == bacillus subtilis deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase.
AB  == bacillus subtilis 168 was shown to contain a deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) gyrase activity which closely resembled those of the enzymes isolated from escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus in its enzymatic requirements, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to several antibiotics. the enzyme was purified from the wild type and nalidixic acid-resistant and novobiocin-resistant mutants of b. subtilis and was functionally characterized in vitro. the genetic loci nala and nova but not novb were shown to code for portions of the functional gyrase. enzyme from the antibiotic-resistant mutants was resistant to the drug in vitro. the most striking observation was the remarkable similarity between the b. subtilis enzyme and other dna gyrases, especially with respect to the oxolinic acid-induced dna cleavage in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. all of the enzymes appeared to possess the same specificity of cutting sites regardless of the source or type of dna used. this result implies that gyrase binding to dna is highly specific.

TI  == properties of an endonuclease activity in micrococcus luteus acting on gamma-irradiated dna and on apurinic dna.
AB  == a protein fraction from micrococcus luteus with endonuclease activity against gamma-irradiated dna was isolated and characterized. an additional activity on apurinic sites could not be separated, either by sucrose gradient sedimentation or by gel filtration through sephadex g 100. from gel filtration, a molecular weight of about 25 000 was calculated for both endonuclease activities. the endonuclease activity against gamma-irradiated dna was stimulated five-fold with  5 mm mg++, whereas that against apurinic sites was less dependent on the mg++ concentration. 100 mm kcl inhibited the gamma-ray endonuclease, but not the apurinic endonuclease activity. in gamma-irradiated rna the protein recognized 1.65 endonuclease sensitive sites per radiation induced single-strand break, among which are 0.45 alkali labile lesions in the nucleotide strand. the affinity of the enzyme for the endonuclease sensitive site was evaluated resulting in a km-value of 73 nm.

TI  == a topoisomerase from escherichia coli related to dna gyrase.
AB  == we have identified a topoisomerase activity from escherichia coli related to dna  gyrase (topoisomerase ii): we designate it topoisomerase ii'. it was constructed  of two subunits, which were purified separately. one is the product of the gyra (formerly nala) gene and is identical to subunit a of dna gyrase. the other is a  50,000-dalton protein, which we have purified to homogeneity and call v. v may be a processed form of the much larger gyrase subunit b or may be derived from a transcript of part of the subunit b structural gene, because preliminary peptide  maps of the two subunits are similar. topoisomerase ii' relaxes negatively supercoiled dna and, uniquely among e. coli topoisomerases, relaxes positive supercoils efficiently. it is the only topoisomerase that can introduce positive  supercoils; these are stoichiometric with enzyme molecules. topoisomerase ii' resembles gyrase in its sensitivity to oxolinic acid, the wrapping of dna in an apparent positive supercoil around the enzyme, and the introduction in an aborted reaction of site-specific double-strand breaks in the dna with concomitant covalent attachment of protein to both newly created 5' ends. unlike dna gyrase,  topoisomerase ii' has no negative supercoiling activity. functional chimeric topoisomerases were constructed with the alpha subunit of the micrococcus luteus  gyrase and v or gyrase subunit b from e. coli. we discuss the implications of the dual of the gyra gene product.

TI  == micrococcus luteus dna gyrase: active components and a model for its supercoiling of dna.
AB  == two active components alpha and beta of micrococcus luteus dna gyrase, of peptide weights of 115,000 and 97,000, respectively, have been purified. each individual  component exhibits little dna gyrase activity; the atp-dependent negative supercoiling of a covalently closed circular dna duplex is catalyzed by a combination of the two. covalent closure by escherichia coli ligase of a circular dna containing single-chain scissions, when carried out in the presence of a combination of the dna gyrase components alpha and beta, gives a positively supercoiled dna upon removal of the bound protein molecules. atp was not present  during the ligase treatment; therefore the positive supercoiling of dna observed  is a result of the binding of gyrase molecules, presumably as multi-subunit oligomers, during the ligation step. this is in contrast to the negative supercoiling of dna catalyzed by gyrase in the presence of atp. a model in which  negative supercoiling of dna is achieved by atp-modulated repetitive wrapping of  the dna around gyrase is described. the model also suggests a plausible mode of action by which translocation of a dna along its helix axis can be actively driven by an atpase.

TI  == biochemical aspects of cardiac muscle differentiation.
AB  == experiments were designed to determine whether dna synthesis ceases in terminally differentiating cardiac muscle of the rat because the activity of the putative replicative dna polymerase (dna polymerase alpha) is lost or whether the activity of this enzyme is lost because dna synthesis ceases. dna-template availability and 3'-hydroxyl termini in nuclei and chromatin, isolated from cardiac muscle at  various times during the developmental period in which dna synthesis and the activity of dna polymerase alpha are decreasing, were measured by using escherichia coli dna polymerase i, micrococcus luteus dna polymerase and dna polymerase alpha under optimal conditions. density-shift experiments with bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate and isopycnic analysis indicate that dna chains being replicated semi-conservatively in vivo continue to be elongated in isolated nuclei by exogenous dna polymerases. dna template and 3'-hydroxyl termini available to exogenously added dna polymerases do not change as cardiac muscle differentiates and the rate of dna synthesis decreases and ceases in vivo. template availability and 3'-hydroxyl termini are also not changed in nuclei isolated from cardiac muscle in which dna synthesis had been inhibited by administration of isoproterenol and theophylline to newborn rats. dna-template availability and 3'-hydroxyl termini, however, were substantially increased in nuclei and chromatin from cardiac muscle of adult rats. this increase is not due  to elevated deoxyribonuclease activity in nuclei and chromatin of the adult. electron microscopy indicates that this increase is also not due to dispersal of  the chromatin or disruption of nuclear morphology. density-shift experiments and  isopycnic analysis of dna from cardiac muscle of the adult show that it is more fragmented than dna from cardiac-muscle cells that are, or have recently ceased,  dividing. these studies indicate that dna synthesis ceases in terminally differentiating cardiac muscle because the activity of a replicative dna polymerase is lost, rather than the activity of this enzyme being lost because dna synthesis ceases.

TI  == purification and characterization of the dna-dependent rna polymerase and its subunit sigma from micrococcus luteus.
AB  == dna-dependent rna polymerase from micrococcus luteus can be isolated from cell extracts after removal of an excess of nucleic acids by fractionation with ammonium sulfate, followed by two consecutive gel filtrations through agarose and chromatography on cellulose phospate. either homogeneous holoenzyme or a mixture  of core and holoenzyme is obtained in this way, as is indicated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the absence of detergent, where core enzyme migrates ahead of holoenzyme. homogeneous core enzyme can be isolated from holoenzyme by chromatography on deae-cellulose. core enzyme contains the subunits alpha, beta and beta' previously described [u.i. lill et al., (1975) eur. j. biochem. 52, 411-420] in a molar ratio of 2:1:1. holoenzyme contains an additional subunit sigma of 80 000 molecular weight (molar subunit composition alpha2 betabeta' sigma) and two relatively small polypeptides (molecular weight 14 000 and 25 000, respectively). subunit sigma may be isolated from holoenzyme by chromatography on deae-cellulose at ph 6.9 in the presence of low concentrations of glycerol. the behaviour of holoenzyme during sedimentation in a glycerol gradient at low ionic strength indicates its occurrence as a dimer of the alpha2betabeta'sigma-protomer, whereas the monomeric form is preferred by core enzyme. holoenzyme is much more active than core enzyme in rna synthesis on  bacteriophage t4dna as template. the activity of the latter is stimulated by isolated sigma. m. luteus sigma as well as holoenzyme enhances also the activity  of core enzyme fro- escherichia coli. the formation of a hybrid between micrococcal sigma and e. coli core polymerase is also suggested by the influence  of sigma on the oligomerisation of the enzyme from e. coli.

TI  == in vitro packaging of uv radiation-damaged dna from bacteriophage t7.
AB  == when dna from bacteriophage t7 is irradiated with uv light, the efficiency with which this dna can be packaged in vitro to form viable phage particles is reduced. a comparison between irradiated dna packaged in vitro and irradiated intact phage particles shows almost identical survival as a function of uv dose when escherichia coli wild type or pola or uvra mutants are used as the host. although uvra mutants perform less host cell reactivation, the pola strains are identical with wild type in their ability to support the growth of irradiated t7  phage or irradiated t7 dna packaged in vitro into complete phage. an examination  of in vitro repair performed by extracts of t7-infected e.coli suggests that t7 dna polymerase may substitute for e. coli dna polymerase i in the resynthesis step of excision repair. also tested was the ability of a similar in vitro repair system that used extracts from uninfected cells to restore biological activity of irradiated dna. when t7 dna damaged by uv irradiation was treated with an endonuclease from micrococcus luteus that is specific for pyrimidine dimers and then was incubated with an extract of uninfected e. coli capable of removing pyrimidine dimers and restoring the dna of its original (whole genome size) molecular weight, this dna showed a higher packaging efficiency than untreated dna, thus demonstrating that the in vitro repair system partially restored the biological activity of uv-damaged dna.

AB  == (deoxyribonucleic acid from micrococcus luteus was methylated in vitro in the presence of s-adenosyl-(14c methyl)methionine with a dna methyltransferase purified from extracts of te. coli infected with bacteriophage t2. the labelled dna was degraded by enzymatic and specific chemical methods and the resulting short oligonucleotides were separated and characterized. tthe analytical data permit the conclusion that the tdna transmethylase reacts specifically with n-g-a-t-c-n sequences in which it converts adenine to a 6-methyl-aminopurine residue.

TI  == synthesis of a chemically reactive analog of the nonsense codon u-g-a. its reaction with ribosomes of escherichia coli.
AB  == nitrophenylated 5'-uridylic acid could be employed as primer in a polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase (micrococcus luteus) reaction to yield  5'-nitrophenylated pu-g-a. after reduction of the nitrophenyl moiety and subsequent bromoacetylation, a 5'-bromoacetamido-phenyl-phosphorylated u-g-a was  obtained, which could be used as an affinity label for the ribosomal binding site of the nonsense codon. if freshly prepared active ribosomes were employed in the  incubation mixtures, the u-g-a analog reacted exclusively with one protein, which is tentatively identified as protein s18. exposure of ribosomes to low temperatures gave rise to a reaction of the u-g-a label with another protein, which was identified as protein s4, the ram gene product. the results of the affinity labeling experiments with the chemically reactive u-g-a derivative are very similar to that obtained with a corresponding derivative of the initiation codon a-u-g (o. pongs and e. lanka (1975) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 75, 1505-1509), which suggests that 70s ribosomes have one preferential codon binding site.

TI  == interaction of wheat-germ agglutinin with bacterial cells and cell-wall polymers.
AB  == wheat germ agglutinin was found to agglutinate cells of escherichia coli pat 84,  micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus h, and of s. aureus 52a5, but not cells of s. aureus 52a2. interaction of wheat germ agglutinin with a soluble linear peptidoglycan secreted by micrococcus luteus and with the teichoic acid of s. aureus h was demonstrated by agar gel diffusion, quantitative precipitation and inhibition of hemagglutination of trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. no interaction could be demonstrated with the teichoic acid from a phage-resistant mutant (s. aureus 52a2) which lacks a-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues. all interactions were specifically inhibited by low concentrations of chitotriose (glcnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnac) and the bacterial cell wall tetrasaccharide, glcnacbeta1 leads to 4murnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnacbeta1 leads to 4murnac. hemagglutination-inhibition experiments showed that the linear peptidoglycan and  the teichoic acid of s. aureus h were several thousand times more potent inhibitors of wheat germ agglutinin than was n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. comparison of the efficiency of different saccharides in inhibition of hemagglutination and  precipitation of polymers by wheat germ agglutinin, strongly suggests that secondary, non-specific interactions contribute to the binding of the lectin to the polymers.

TI  == comparative ability of rna and dna to prime dna synthesis in vitro: role of sequence, sugar, and structure of template-primer.
AB  == the priming efficiency of oligo(rna) vs. oligo(dna) in a homopolymer template-homooligomer primer system was compared using four dna polymerases. the  templates included (dt)n, (da)n, (dc)n, and (di)n. primers were the oligomers of  the complementary dna or rna with chain lengths of 6 to 23. the dna polymerases used were from micrococcus luteus, avian myeloblastosis virus (amv), and escherichia coli (polymerase i and polymerase iii). the polymerases demonstrated  a preference for the dna primers with (dc)n, (da)n, and (di)n templates. however, when (dt)n was the template, all but the amv polymerase preferred (ra)11 more than 200-fold better than (da)12. this preference was due to the physical structure of the initiation complex. the structures of the oligo-polymer complexes were characterized by mixing curves, melting curves, and analytical bouyant density analyses. (ra)11 + (dt)n formed predominatly a duplex structure,  whereas (da)12 + (dt)n formed the three- stranded structure, (da12-2(dt)n. the km of the duplex with e. coli pol iii was 2.9 mugm (ra)11. the ki of the triplex was 2.2 mugm (da)12, indicating that pol iii could bind to the triplex but would not  elongate the (da)12 primer. the influence of structure on priming also was demonstrated with longer oligomers, (da)23 and (ra)23, where the (da)23 formed more duplex-like structures and primed more than the (da)12.(dt)10 + (da)n complexes also were shown to form triplex structures that inhibited priming. these results show that template-primer structure has more influence on priming than the sugar moiety or the sequence of the nucleic acid.

TI  == synthesis of a chemically reactive analog of the initiation codon: its reaction with ribosomes of escherichia coli.
AB  == nitrophenylated 5'-adenylic acid could be employed as primer in a polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase (micrococcus luteus) reaction to yield  5'-nitrophenylated pa-u-g. after reduction and subsequent bromoacetylation, an a-u-g analog was obtained, which could be used as an affinity label for the ribosomal a-u-g-binding site(s). after incubating the a-u-g affinity label with 70s ribosomes, 30s subunits programmed for initiation-factor-dependent fmet-trnametf binding were obtained. hence, the a-u-g analog had irreversibly reacted at the ribosomal decoding site. initiation complexes which were formed with the labeled 30s subunits were puromycin-resistant. furthermore, gtp hydrolysis, necessary for proper accommodation of initiator trna at the ribosomal donorsite, did not function in these complexes. these data indicate that immobilization of a-u-g at the decoding site of the ribosome allows factor-dependent initiator trna binding, but impairs accommodation at the donor site. the ribosomal protein(s) to which a-u-g was covalently bound at the decoding site were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea or sarkosyl. the predominant affinity-labeled protein was found  to be protein s18. variation of the incubation conditions of the affinity-labeling reaction leads to attachment of a-u-g label to another ribosomal protein, s4, the ram gene product.

TI  == a comparison of the effects of daunomycin and adriamycin on various dna polymerases.
AB  == the effects of the anthracycline antiboties, daunomycin and adriamycin, on the dna-directed activities of dna polymerases from murine sarcoma virus, rat liver (high-molecular-weight species), escherichia coli, and micrococcus luteus were determined. under all conditions tested, these compounds had greater inhibitory effect against the viral polymerase than against cellular polymerase. the inhibition of murine sarcoma virus dna polymerase by daunomycin was competitive with respect to dna. for viral dna polymerase it was concluded that the inhibition was predominatly caused by the interaction of duanomycin with the primer-template dna. also, an appreciable reversal of the daunomycin-induced inhibition of this polymerase by an increase in mg-2+ concentration is consistent with the conclusion derived by competition experiments. in contrast, the inhibition of both rat liver and m. luteus dna polymerases was essentially noncompetitive with dna. also, bacterial enzymes wer e less sensitive to inhibition by these drugs than the virion polymerase. the strong and preferential inhibiton of viral dna polymerase is discussed in relation to a differential sensitivity of normal as compared to tumor cells observed in some cell lines.

TI  == ultraviolet reactivation and ultraviolet mutagenesis of infectious lambda dna: strong inhibition by treatment of dna in vitro with uv-endonuclease from micrococcus luteus.
AB  == uv-endonuclease from microcossuc luteus induces single-stranded breaks in uv-irradiated dna of phage lambda and the average length of the fragments produced (after uv-doses to dna of 135 and 675 erg/mm2) is equal to the average spacing between pyrimidine dimers. the plaque-forming ability of uv-irradiated lambda dna used to infect ca++-treated uvr a6, uvrb5 or uvrc34 recipient escherichia coli cells (but not uve+ cells) may be significantly enhanced by treatment of lambda dna with uv-endonuclease. this enzyme strongly decreases the  reactivation of uv-irradiated lambda dna caused by uv-irradiation of uvr+ or uvra6 ca++-treated cells and eliminates most clear-mutations especially if mutations are analysed using ca++-treated uvr a6 recipient cells. it is concluded that uv-endonuclease switches a significant part of potentially mutagenic pyrimidine dimers from the uv-induced "error-prone" repair pathway to "error-free" excision repair pathway.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase iii of escherichia coli. characterization of associated exonuclease activities.
AB  == purified dna polymerase iii has two distinct exonuclease activities: one initiates hydrolsis at the 3 termini, and the other at the 5 termini of single-stranded dna. both exonucleases have the same relative mobility on polyacrylamide gels as the polymerase activity. molecular identity of the three activities is further indicated by their comparative rates of thermal inactivation and their sensitivity to ionic strength. the 3-5 exonuclease activity hydrolyzes only single-standed dna. the rate of hydrolysis is twice the  optimal rate of polymerization. the products are 5-mononucleotides, but the 3-5 activity is unable to cleave free dinucleotides or the 5-terminal dinucleotide of a polydeoxynucleotide chain. the 3-5 activity will not degrade 3-phosphoryl-terminated oligonucleotides such as d(ptptptp). the 5-3 activity catalyzes the hydrolysis of single-stranded dna at 1/15 the rate of the 3-5 exonuclease. the 5-3 exonuclease requires the presence of a 5 single-stranded terminus in order to initiate hydrolysis, but will thereafter proceed into a double-stranded region. although the limit products found during hydrolysis of substrates designed to assay specifically the 5-3 activity are predominantly mono- and dinucleotides, these products probably arise from the subsequent hydrolysis of oligonucleotides by the 3-5 hydrolytic activity. this interpretation is supported by (a) the relatively greater activity of the 3-5 exonuclease, (b) the inability of the enzyme to degrade d(ptptptp), and (c) the release of the 5 terminus of a single-stranded dna molecule as an oligonucleotide. the 5-3 exonuclease attacks ultraviolet-irradiated duplex dna which has first been incised by the micrococcus luteus endonuclease specific for  thymine dimers in dna.

TI  == interaction of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein with dnas of different base composition.
AB  == the changes in absorption spectra in the visible region observed on adding different naturally occurring and synthetic dna duplexes to solutions of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein indicate that the mercurial reacts with polynucleotides of this type. the reaction is reversible as proved by adding excess of kcn which restores the original spectra of the free dye. the interaction is characterised also by quenching of the fluorescence of the dye and the induction of optical activity in it. the extent of these spectral effects depends strongly on the (a+t) content of the complexed dna and decreased in the order: poly [d(a-t)], clostridium perfringens dan, escherichia coli dna, micrococcus luteus dna and poly(dc). from equilibrium-dialysis experiments the same order in affinity is obtained when these poly-nucleotides are at equilibrium with the same concentration of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein. from the changes produced by different mercurials in the ord spectra and viscosity of a dna solution it has been concluded that 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein does not cause any drastic alteration of the secondary structure of dna.

TI  == 'single addition' and 'transnucleotidation' reactions catalyzed by polynucleotide phosphorylase. effect of enzymatic removal of inorganic phosphate during reaction.
AB  == the reaction of the tetranucleotide, pa-a(2)-a, with 2'(3')-0-(alpha-methoxyethyl)uridine 5'-diphosphate, mg(2+) ions, and m. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase followed by mild acid treatment to remove the blocking groups results in a 49% yield of the desired single addition product, pa-a(3)-u, together with smaller amounts of pa-a-u, pa-a-a, pa-a(2)-u, pa-a(2)-a, pa-a(3)-a, pa-a(4)-u, and pa-a(4)-a. the side products are thought to arise from  the phosphorolysis of the acceptor molecule by the inorganic phosphate formed in  the reaction mixture and from subsequent additions to the various oligonucleotide species by the resulting adenosine 5'-diphosphate. a system developed for the removal of inorganic phosphate as it is formed in the synthesis involves the addition to the reaction mixture of calf spleen nucleoside phosphorylase and nicotinamide riboside and, under these conditions, pa-a(3)-u can be prepared in 90% yield with essentially no side products. under similar conditions, pa-a(3)-a, pa-a(3)-g, and pa-a(3)-c may be prepared from pa-a(2)-a and the appropriate blocked nucleoside diphosphate in yields of 85-94%. the incubation of pa-a(2)-a alone with polynucleotide phosphorylase exhibits the phenomenon of "transnucleotidation" in that the molecule is partially converted to oligonucleotides of smaller and larger chain lengths. in the presence of the phosphate removal system, however, the tetranucleotide is not attacked by the enzyme, and thus, "transnucleotidation" appears to be simply a combination of phosphorolytic and addition reactions catalyzed by trace amounts of inorganic phosphate contaminating the enzyme and/or the substrate.

TI  == isolation of circular dna molecules from whole cellular dna by use of atp-dependent deoxyribonuclease.
AB  == a technique is described for isolation of plasmid dna in closed and open circular double-stranded forms from bacterial cells, by use of atp-dependent deoxyribonuclease purified from micrococcus luteus. this dnase, acting only upon  linear dna molecules, degrades all bacterial chromosomal dna extracted in the linear form. circular plasmid dnas are left intact, and are then separated by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient. unlike previous techniques for analysis of plasmid dna, this technique can be used to isolate not only closed circular dna but also open circular dna. several plasmids, such as those from phage (lambdadv1 and lambdadv21), a colicinogenic factor (col e2), a sex factor (f(8)'  gal), and "minicircles" in escherichia coli 15, in both the open and closed circular forms, were well separated from chromosomal dna by this technique.

TI  == a dna-binding protein in the serum of certain mammalian species.
AB  == various mammalian species contain an anionic serum protein that reacts specifically with native dna. it is considerably less reactive with single-strand dna and does not react with monodeoxyribonucleotides, homopolyribonucleotides, or duplexes of homopolyribonucleotides. synthetic da.dt was an effective inhibitor of the reaction with native dna, while micrococcus luteus dna and dg.dc were not  inhibitory. this protein was encountered in the course of studies on dna antibodies. although it reacted with red cells coated with dna and gave agar precipitation bands, it was clearly distinct from dna antibodies. it was found in the serum of all animals of a given species, migrated as an alpha-beta globulin,  and did not crossreact with gammaglobulins. it reacted with dna in solution to give precipitation curves that were strongly influenced by changes in ionic strength. the protein was isolated from canine serum by precipitation with dna and purified to homogeneity, as judged by immunochemical and electrophoretic criteria.a similar protein was found in mink, equine, and other sera, but not in  human sera. previous studies on dna antibodies in certain experimental animals may have given false positive results due to this protein.

TI  == endonucleolytic activity from micrococcus luteus that acts on -ray-induced damage in plasmid dna of escherichia coli minicells.
AB  == a partially purified extract from micrococcus luteus contains endonucleolytic activity toward ultraviolet (uv)-irradiated deoxyribonucleic acid (dna). we found that the same extract also acts on superhelical, covalently-closed circular lambdadv dna isolated from gamma-irradiated minicells of e. coli. the introduction of nicks in isolated covalently-closed circular dna by an endonuclease in the extract results in relaxed circles, and these two circular dna species are easily distinguishable by their sedimentation properties in alkaline sucrose. the frequency with which the endonuclease-susceptible lesions are produced in superhelical dna is only marginally enhanced when (60)co gamma-rays are administered to an aerobic rather than an anoxic minicell suspension. the ratio of endonuclease-sensitive defects to single-strand scissions, induced by gamma-irradiation in air, is about 1:3. the nuclease-sensitive lesions disappear from gamma-irradiated minicells during incubation after radiation presumably as a consequence of excision repair. since  the addition of uv-irradiated calf-thymus dna depresses the ability of the m. luteus extract to attack not only uv-damaged e. coli dna (a known substrate for the so-called uv-specific endonuclease that catalyzes the initial single-strand incision adjacent to the structural defect) but, also lambdadv dna injured by gamma-rays, we conclude that physicochemical alterations induced by both types of radiation are recognized by one and the same endonuclease.
