potentially probiotic and bioprotective lactic acid bacteria starter cultures antagonise the listeria monocytogenes adhesion to ht29 colonocyte-like cells.
the capability of five lactic acid bacteria (lab) to counteract the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line ht29 was studied. the highest adhesion ability to ht29 was achieved by the intestinal strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, followed by the meat-derived strains lactobacillus sakei ctc494 and enterococcus faecium ctc8005. surprisingly, the meat strains showed significantly better adhesion to ht29 than two faecal isolates of lactobacillus casei and even significantly higher than the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture l. sakei ctc494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of l. monocytogenes to ht29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. the performance was better than the faecal isolate l. rhamnosus ctc1679. our results reinforce the fact that the ability of lab to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food lab behave better than intestinal ones. therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. these strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible.
detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
