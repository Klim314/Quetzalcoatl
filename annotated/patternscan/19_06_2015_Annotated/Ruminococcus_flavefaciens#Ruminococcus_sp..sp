TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == molecular diversity of the foregut bacteria community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius).
AB  == the molecular diversity of the foregut bacterial community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius) in central australia was investigated through comparative analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences prepared from the foregut contents of 12 adult feral camels fed on native vegetation. a total of 267 full-length 16s rrna  gene clones were examined, with 151 operational taxonomic units (otus) identified at a 99% species-level identity cut-off criterion. the prediction of actual diversity in the foregut of the dromedary camel using the chaol approach was 238  otus, while the richness and evenness of the diversity estimated using shannon index was 4.84. the majority of bacteria in the current study were affiliated with the bacterial phylum firmicutes (67% of total clones) and were related to the classes clostridia, bacilli and mollicutes, followed by the bacteroidetes (25%) that were mostly represented by the family prevotellaceae. the remaining phyla were represented by actinobacteria, chloroflexi, cynophyta, lentisphaerae,  planctomycetes, proteobacteria and sphirochaetes. moreover, 11 clones of cultivated bacteria were identified as brevundimonas sp., butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella sp. and ruminococcus flavefaciens. the novelty in this foregut environment is remarkable where 97% of the otus were distantly related to any known sequence in the public database.

TI  == ruminococcus champanellensis sp. nov., a cellulose-degrading bacterium from human gut microbiota.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic, cellulolytic strain, designated 18p13(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. cells were gram-positive non-motile cocci. strain 18p13(t) was able to degrade microcrystalline cellulose but the utilization of soluble sugars was restricted to cellobiose. acetate and succinate were the major end products of cellulose and cellobiose fermentation. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate belonged to the genus ruminococcus of the family ruminococcaceae. the closest phylogenetic relative was the ruminal cellulolytic strain ruminococcus flavefaciens atcc 19208(t) (<95% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity). the dna g+c content of strain 18p13(t) was 53.05+/-0.7 mol%. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis, and morphological and physiological  data, strain 18p13(t) can be differentiated from other members of the genus ruminococcus with validly published names. the name ruminococcus champanellensis  sp. nov. is proposed, with 18p13(t) (=dsm 18848(t)=jcm 17042(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of gayals (bos frontalis), yaks (bos  grunniens) and yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the dominant rumen bacteria in gayals, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle were investigated using pcr-dgge approach. the analysis of dgge profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16s rdna sequences in  dgge profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. dgge profiles revealed that gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of  intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. a total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. according to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen  dominant bacteria of gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the  genera lachnospiraceae bacterium, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium celerecrescens. moreover, the dominant bacteria of yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, schwartzia succinivorans and clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. in addition, the dominant bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing prevotella sp., staphylococci lentus, staphylococcus xylosus and corynebacterium casei. present study first detected staphylococcus lentus and staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == description of development of rumen ecosystem by pcr assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == performance of a three-stage membrane bioprocess treating the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and evolution of its archaeal and bacterial ecology.
AB  == a novel three-stage bioprocess achieved 75% volatile solids (vs) removal at an organic loading rate (olr) of 4g vsl(-1)day, a solids retention time (srt) of 66days, a hydraulic retention time (hrt) of 20days, at a temperature of 35 degrees c. the bioprocess consisted of an anaerobic hydrolytic reactor (hr) where the solids and liquid fractions of the organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (ofmsw) were separated with a mesh. the leachate was pumped to a submerged  anaerobic membrane bioreactor (sambr) and the treated permeate was polished in an aerobic membrane bioreactor (ambr). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and dna sequencing analyses indicated that the increase in methane content in the hr caused by the excess sludge recycle from the sambr was associated with  an increase in the number of hydrogenotrophic species, mainly methanobrevibacter  sp., methanobacterium formicicum and methanosarcina sp. at 20 degrees c vs removal dropped to 50% in the hr and some dgge bands disappeared when compared to 35 degrees c samples, while some bands such as the one corresponding to ruminococcus flavefaciens were reduced in intensity. the species associated with  the cod-polishing properties of the ambr correspond to the genera pseudomonas, hyphomonas and hyphomicrobiaceae. these results highlight the positive effect of  recycling the excess sludge from the sambr to re-inoculate the hr with hydrogenotrophic species.

TI  == effect of methanobrevibacter sp mf1 inoculation on glycoside hydrolase and polysaccharide depolymerase activities, wheat straw degradation and volatile fatty acid concentrations in the rumen of gnotobiotically-reared lambs.
AB  == four naturally born lambs were placed in sterile isolators 24 h after birth before the natural establishment of cellulolytic microorganisms and archaea methanogens. at the age of 6 weeks they were inoculated with pure cultures of the strains fd1 and 007 of ruminococcus flavefaciens and at the age of 4 months with  a pure culture of methanobrevibacter sp. mf1. following the establishment of mf1, the population of r. flavefaciens slightly increased in the rumen of the four lambs, there was also an increase in straw degradation, in the activity of some glycoside and polysaccharide hydrolases of the adherent microbial populations and in the concentration of acetate in ruminal contents.

TI  == the dynamics of major fibrolytic microbes and enzyme activity in the rumen in response to short- and long-term feeding of sapindus rarak saponins.
AB  == aims: to investigate the short- and long-term effects of an extract of sapindus rarak saponins (se) on the rumen fibrolytic enzyme activity and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms. methods and results: two feeding trials were conducted. in the short-term trial, four fistulated goats were fed a basal diet containing sugar cane tops and wheat pollard (65:35, w/w) and were supplemented for 7 days with se at a level of 0.6 g kg(-1) body weight. rumen liquor was taken before, during and after se feeding. in the long-term trial, 28 sheep were fed the same basal diet as the goats and were supplemented for 105 days with 0.24, 0.48 and 0.72 g kg(-1) body mass of the extract. rumen liquor was taken on days 98 and 100. protozoal numbers were counted under the microscope. cell wall degradation was determined by enzyme assays and the major fibrolytic micro-organisms were quantified by dot blot hybridization. sapindus extract significantly depressed rumen xylanase activity in both trials and carboxymethylcellulase activity in the long-term trial (p < 0.01). fibrobacter sp. were not affected by the se in both trials, while ruminococci and the anaerobic fungi showed a short-term response to the application of saponins. protozoal counts were decreased only in the long-term trial with sheep. conclusion: these data suggest that there is an adaptation of ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens and chytridiomycetes (fungi) to saponin when fed over a long period. the fact that no correlation between the cell wall degrading enzyme  activities and the cell wall degrading micro-organisms was observed suggests that the organisms tracked in this experiment are not the only key players in ruminal  cell wall degradation. significance and impact of the study: sapindus rarak saponins partially defaunate the rumen flora. their negative effect on cell wall  degradation, however, is not related to rumen organisms currently recognized as the major cell wall degrading species. the adaptation of microbes in the long-term feeding experiment suggests that the results from short-term trial on the ruminal microbial community have to be interpreted carefully.

TI  == albusin b, a bacteriocin from the ruminal bacterium ruminococcus albus 7 that inhibits growth of ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == an approximately 32-kda protein (albusin b) that inhibited growth of ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1 was isolated from culture supernatants of ruminococcus albus 7. traditional cloning and gene-walking pcr techniques revealed an open reading frame (albb) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32,168 da. a blast search revealed two homologs of albb from the unfinished genome of r. albus 8 and moderate similarity to llpa, a recently described 30-kda bacteriocin from pseudomonas sp. strain bw11m1.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == three neocallimastix patriciarum esterases associated with the degradation of complex polysaccharides are members of a new family of hydrolases.
AB  == acetylesterase and cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activities were demonstrated in culture supernatant of the anaerobic ruminal fungus neocallimastix patriciarum. a cdna expression library from n. patriciarum was screened for esterases using beta-naphthyl acetate and a model cinnamoyl ester compound. cdna clones representing four different esterase genes (bnaa-d) were isolated. none of the enzymes had cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity, but two of the enzymes (bnaa and  bnac) had acetylxylan esterase activity, bnaa, bnab and bnac encode proteins with several distinct domains. carboxy-terminal repeats in bnaa and bnac are homologous to protein-docking domains in other enzymes from neocallimastix species and another anaerobic fungus, a piromyces sp. the catalytic domains of bnab and bnac are members of a recently described family of ser/his active site hydrolases [upton, c. & buckley, j.t. (1995). trends biochem sci 20, 178-179]. bnab exhibits 40% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the cele cellulase from clostridium thermocellum and bnac exhibits 52% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the xynb xylanase from ruminococcus flavefaciens. bnaa, whilst exhibiting less than 10% overall amino acid identity to bnab or bnac, or to any other known protein, appears to be a member of the same family of hydrolases, having the three universally conserved amino acid sequence motifs. several other previously described esterases are also shown to be members of this family, including a rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase from aspergillus aculeatus. however, none of the other previously described enzymes with acetylxylan esterase activity are members of this family of hydrolases.

TI  == dockerin-like sequences in cellulases and xylanases from the rumen cellulolytic bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == recent analysis of the enda cellulase gene from ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 has  revealed that it encodes a product of 759 amino acids that provides the first example of a multidomain cellulase from a ruminococcus sp. following the family 5 catalytic domain in the predicted enda enzyme is a 282 amino acid domain of unknown function for which no close relationship was found to other protein sequences. however, the c-terminal sequences of enda contain a 34 amino acid threonine-rich linker connected to an 81 amino acid region, both of which show strong similarities to sequences present in two xylanases from r. flavefaciens 17. a distant relationship is evident between regions of the 80 amino acid sequences of enda, xynd and xynb and the duplicated 23 amino acid dockerin sequences found in cellulolytic clostridium sp., suggesting that as in clostridium sp. these sequences could mediate the binding of enzymatic polypeptides to another component in the cell surface enzyme complex of r. flavefaciens.

TI  == the effect of rumen chitinolytic bacteria on cellulolytic anaerobic fungi.
AB  == the polycentric anaerobic fungus orpinomyces joyonii a4 was cultivated on microcrystalline cellulose alone and in association with the rumen chitinolytic bacterium clostridium sp. strain chk5, which shows strong phenotypic similarity to clostridium tertium. the presence of strain chk5 significantly depressed the solubilization of microcrystalline cellulose, the production of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and the release of endoglucanase by the fungus. co-culture of the monocentric anaerobic fungus neocallimastix frontalis strain re1, neocallimastix  sp. strain g-1 and caecomyces sp. strain sc2 with strain chk5 also resulted in depressed fungal cellulolysis. cell-free supernatant fluids from strain chk5 inhibited the release of reducing sugars from carboxymethylcellulose by cell-free supernatant fluids from o. joyonii strain a4. strain 007 of the cellulolytic anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens was also shown to produce small amounts of soluble products upon incubation with colloidal chitin. mixtures of culture supernates from this bacterium and from o. joyonii strain a4 showed cellulase activity that was less than that of the component cultures. it is suggested that  the ability of some rumen bacteria to hydrolyse or transform chitin may be an important factor in the interactions between bacteria and fungi in the rumen.

TI  == response to various amounts of aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract on ruminal metabolism in cattle.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine whether aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract stimulated or inhibited ruminal fermentation when fed at higher than recommended doses (3 g/d). four dietary treatments of a. oryzae fermentation extract were fed daily to six cows fitted with ruminal cannulas. for each of four periods, bromegrass hay (6% cp) with and without extract was fed for 28 d. dacron bags containing bromegrass cell walls were ruminally incubated to determine ruminal fiber degradation. the a. oryzae fermentation extract did not affect degradation of cell walls, cellulose, or hemicellulose. total ruminal anaerobic or cellulolytic bacteria were not different among treatments; neither were the proportions of cellulolytic species, butyrivibrio sp., ruminococcus albus, or ruminococcus flavefaciens. ruminal ammonia was not different; however,  total vfa were higher, and ph tended to be lower, when 27 g/d of a. oryzae fermentation extract was fed. the proportion of vfa was not different among treatments. the a. oryzae fermentation extract fed at nine times the recommended  dosage did not produce any stimulatory effects, except for total vfa, and was not inhibitory or toxic to ruminal metabolism and forage fiber degradation.

TI  == ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa from bison, cattle-bison hybrids, and  cattle fed three alfalfa-corn diets.
AB  == ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. the total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x  10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7)  to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. the genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of diplodiniinae was higher (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (p less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). this was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic butyrivibrio isolates. the numbers of ruminococcus albus and r. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although r. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. in  vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (p less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. the concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
