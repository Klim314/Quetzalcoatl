TI  == are enterococcus populations present during malolactic fermentation of red wine safe?
AB  == the aim of this study was the genetic characterisation and safety evaluation of 129 enterococcus isolates obtained from wine undergoing malolactic fermentation.  genetic characterisation by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr displayed 23 genotypes. 25 isolates representative of all genotypes were identified as enterococcus faecium by species-specific pcr and assayed for antibiotic resistance, presence of virulence genes and aminobiogenic capacity, both in decarboxylase medium and wine. the aminobiogenic capacity in wine was analysed in presence (assay 1) and absence (assay 2) of oenococcus oeni cect 7621. resistance to tetracycline, cotrimoxazol, vancomycin and teicoplanin was exhibited by 96% of the strains, but none of them harboured the assayed virulence genes. all of the strains harboured the tyrosine decarboxylase (tdc) gene, while 44% were positive  for tyramine in decarboxylase medium. only five out of 25 strains survived in wine after seven days of incubation, and when concentrations of biogenic amines in wines were determined by hplc, only those wines in which the five surviving strains occurred contained biogenic amines. histamine, putrescine and cadaverine  were detected in wines from both assays, although concentrations were higher in assay 2. tyramine and phenylethylamine were detected only in absence of o. oeni.  this research contributes for the knowledge of safety aspects of enterococci related to winemaking.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
