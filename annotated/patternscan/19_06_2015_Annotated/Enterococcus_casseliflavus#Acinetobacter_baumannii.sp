TI  == management of purulent pericarditis.
AB  == a 50 year old man was admitted to icu due to purulent pericarditis, purulent inflammation of the soft tissue of the neck, purulent mediastinitis and pneumonia. subxyphoid periocardiotomy followed by the insertion of a drain into the pericardial space was performed. four other drains were also inserted to drain purulent fluid from the neck (two drains) and mediastinum (two drains). during the surgical procedure, 700 ml of purulent pericardial fluid from the pericardial sac and 200 ml of purulent fluid from the mediastinum were drained. antibiotic therapy was started upon admission to the hospital. streptococcus species, acinetobacter baumani and enterococcus casseliflavus were cultured. antibiotic therapy was adjusted to the results of the antibiogram. despite revised antibiotic therapy, daily drainage from the pericardium--during several days after surgery--was around 200 ml. due to the huge purulent pericardial drainage streptokinase, delivered directly into pericardial space, was given. the clinical effect of intrapericardial streptokinase administration was excellent. after 17 days drainage of purulent pericardial fluid was not observed. no clinical signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis developed. repeated echocardiography examinations showed no signs of constrictive pericarditis and no pericardial fluid. the patient was discharged in good general condition.
