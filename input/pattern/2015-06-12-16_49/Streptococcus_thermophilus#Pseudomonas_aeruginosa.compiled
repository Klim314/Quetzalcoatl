TI  - Evaluation of anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant potential of andrographolide and echiodinin isolated from callus culture of Andrographis paniculata Nees.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant activity of andrographolide (AND) and echiodinin (ECH) of Andrographis paniculata. METHODS: In this study, an attempt has been made to demonstrate the anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activity of isolated AND and ECH by broth micro-dilution method and 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, respectively. Structure elucidation was determined by electro-spray ionization-MSD, NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and IR spectra. RESULTS: AND was effective against most of the strains tested including Mycobacterium smegmatis, showing broad spectrum of growth inhibition activity with Minimum inhibitory concentration values against Staphylococcus aureus (100 microg/mL), Streptococcus thermophilus (350 microg/mL) Bacillus subtilis (100 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (50 microg/mL), Mycobacterium smegmatis (200 microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumonia (100 microg/mL), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (200 microg/mL). ECH showed specific anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a concentration higher than 225 microg/mL. Both AND and ECH were not effective against the two yeast strains, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae tested in this study. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study showed promising anti-bacterial activity and moderate free radical scavenging activity of AND and ECH, and it may provide the scientific rationale for its popular folklore medicines.
TI  - Assessment of enzymatic cleaning agents and disinfectants against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - PURPOSE: Microbial biofilm has become difficult to control by antibiotic and biocide regimes that are effective against suspended bacteria. Their colonization of surfaces can be a problem and is generally controlled through cleaning and disinfection. This study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of the disinfectants including Bio-Ow, Econase CE, Gamanase GC 140, IndiAge 44L, Mannanase AMB, Multifect P-3000, Neutrase, Pandion, Paradigm, Pectinex Ultra SP-L, Promozyme, Resinase A2X, Spezyme AA300, Spezyme GA300 and Vinozym EC, and the proteinase against bacterial biofilms. METHODS: The effectiveness of 20 commercial disinfectants against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) biofilms using a fluorometric technique was examined. Additionally the disinfectants were also tested against Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) isolates using microtitration tray based turbidimetric techniques. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used as the test bacteria in the fluorometric control method. RESULTS: Among the first group of the enzymatic cleaning agents tested, four disinfectants (Pandion, Resinase A2X, Spezyme GA300 and Paradigm) were the most potent against bacterial biofilms after 30 min incubation time (residual bacterial count less than 10(3) CFU (colony forming units)/ml). However, only Resinase A2X and Paradigm showed a good effect on bacterial biofilms after 15 min incubation time. Proteinase disinfectants (alkalase, chymotrypsin, cryotin and krilltrypsin) from the second group of the disinfectants showed a good effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm when tested in the absence of milk. The performance of the disinfectants was reduced in the presence of milk. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the cleaning agents was determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth. The MIC was tested on Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Paradigm against S. thermophilus and L. Lactis were lower than L. Bulgaricus. Whereas, the MIC of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was lower than MIC against L. lactis. Resinase A2X had no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth when the concentration was less than or equal to 2.4 mg/ml and Spezyme GA 300 concentration less than or equal to 7.3 mg/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was 2.7 microg/ml and against L. lactis 5.3 microg/ml. Growth of S. thermophilus was inhibited in all concentration of Pandion tested. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of disinfectant or cleaning agent along with the optimum concentration and the time of action is very important when destroying microbes. It is also important that the resistances of microbes to different disinfectants and cleaning agents be taken into account when planning the cleaning process
TI  - Challenge testing of the lactoperoxidase system in pasteurized milk.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the role of lactoperoxidase (LP) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (LP)-enriched ultra-heat treated (UHT) milk after subsequent pasteurization. Milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. Pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees C/15 s and 80 degrees C/15 s to determine the effect of the LP system on the micro-organisms. An active LP system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (KQ) of milks inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees C, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees C, presumably due to virtual inactivation of LP at 80 degrees C. However, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the KQ of milks challenged with Bacillus cereus spores. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the LP system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater KQ of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees C/15 s compared with 80 degrees C/15 s. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
