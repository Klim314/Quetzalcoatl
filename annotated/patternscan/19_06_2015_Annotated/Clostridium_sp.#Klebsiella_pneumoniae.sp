TI  == composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some acinos miller species.
AB  == gc and gc/ms analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six acinos miller species from serbia and montenegro were performed. seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. the common feature of the a. suaveolens, a. majoranifolius and a. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the a. graveolens, a. arvensis and a. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. the total flavonoids, polyphenols  and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (frap and dpph assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. the highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of a. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. a disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: bacillus subtilis, clostridium pyogenes, enterococcus sp., micrococcus flavus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli; fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae). the preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of a. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == unraveling the dha cluster in citrobacter werkmanii: comparative genomic analysis of bacterial 1,3-propanediol biosynthesis clusters.
AB  == in natural 1,3-propanediol (pdo) producing microorganisms such as klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and clostridium sp., the genes coding for pdo producing enzymes are grouped in a dha cluster. this article describes the dha cluster of a novel candidate for pdo production, citrobacter werkmanii dsm17579 and compares the cluster to the currently known pdo clusters of enterobacteriaceae and clostridiaceae. moreover, we attribute a putative function to two previously unannotated orfs, orfw and orfy, both in c. freundii and in c.  werkmanii: both proteins might form a complex and support the glycerol dehydratase by converting cob(i)alamin to the glycerol dehydratase cofactor coenzyme b12. unraveling this biosynthesis cluster revealed high homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frames of c. werkmanii dsm17579 and those of c. freundii dsm30040 and k. pneumoniae mgh78578, i.e., 96 and 87.5 % identity, respectively. on the other hand, major differences between the clusters have also been discovered. for example, only one dihydroxyacetone kinase (dhak) is present in the dha cluster of c. werkmanii dsm17579, while two dhak enzymes are present in the cluster of k. pneumoniae mgh78578 and clostridium butyricum vpi1718.

TI  == fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in crude oil contaminated wetland ultisol.
AB  == the effect of crude oil on the growth of legumes (calopogonium muconoides and centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. the results revealed observable  effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation as well as  on densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria.  the effects however varied with different levels (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of pollution. ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the unpolluted soil but decreased with increase in pollution levels. nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5.26 +/- 0.23 x l0(6)cfu/g in unpolluted soil to 9.0 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) and 2.2 +/- 0.08 x l0(5) cfu/g in soils with 5% and 20% levels of pollution respectively. the contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. a range of 13-57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on unpolluted soil. the heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and unpolluted soil were statistically significant (p < 0.05, anova). positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r = 0.91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r = 0.86). on the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = -0.30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15% and 20% pollution  levels. the lsd tests revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the  physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. the results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. among the bacterial species isolated, clostridium pasteurianum, bacillus polymyxa and pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than azotobacter sp, klebsiella pneumoniae and derxia gummusa while  nitrosomonas and nitrobacter had the least degradability. a continuous monitoring of the environment is advocated to prevent extinction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and total loss of soil fertility attributable to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the niger delta ultisol.

TI  == an electron-flow model can predict complex redox reactions in mixed-culture fermentative bioh2: microbial ecology evidence.
AB  == we developed the first model for predicting community structure in mixed-culture  fermentative biohydrogen production using electron flows and nadh2 balances. a key assumption of the model is that h2 is produced only via the pyruvate decarboxylation-ferredoxin-hydrogenase pathway, which is commonly the case for fermentation by clostridium and ethanoligenens species. we experimentally tested  the model using clone libraries to gauge community structures with mixed cultures in which we did not pre-select for specific bacterial groups, such as spore-formers. for experiments having final phs 3.5 and 4.0, where h2 yield and soluble end-product distribution were distinctly different, we established stoichiometric reactions for each condition by using experimentally determined electron equivalent balances. the error in electron balancing was only 3% at final ph 3.5, in which butyrate and acetate were dominant organic products and the h2 yield was 2.1 mol h2/mol glucose. clone-library analysis showed that clones affiliated with clostridium sp. bl-22 and clostridium sp. hpb-16 were dominant at final ph 3.5. for final ph 4.0, the h2 yield was 0.9 mol h2/mol glucose, ethanol, and acetate were the dominant organic products, and the electron balance error was 13%. the significant error indicates that a second pathway for h2 generation was active. the most abundant clones were affiliated with klebsiella pneumoniae, which uses the formate-cleavage pathway for h2 production. thus, the clone-library analyses confirmed that the model predictions for when the pyruvate decarboxylation-ferredoxin-hydrogenase pathway was (final ph 3.5) or was not (final ph 4.0) dominant. with the electron-flow model, we can  easily assess the main mechanisms for h2 formation and the dominant h2-producing  bacteria in mixed-culture fermentative bioh2.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  == bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were  tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater  and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

TI  == hepatic abscesses in dogs: 14 cases (1982-1994).
AB  == objectives: to determine typical clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings in dogs with hepatic abscesses, to assess outcome of treatment, and to evaluate the  role that abdominal ultrasonography has in the diagnosis of hepatic abscesses in  dogs and in monitoring response to treatment. design: retrospective case series.  animals: 14 dogs with hepatic abscesses. results: anorexia and lethargy were the  most common historical complaints, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. physical abnormalities included fever, dehydration, signs of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and mucosal bleeding. hematologic abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and mild anemia. serum biochemical abnormalities included high alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities and high bilirubin concentration; hypoalbuminemia and prolonged coagulation values were also reported. abdominal radiography revealed hepatomegaly, poor abdominal detail, a hepatic mass, or splenomegaly in 9 dogs. thoracic radiography revealed alveolar consolidation or mixed bronchial/interstitial pulmonary patterns in 6 dogs. hypoechoic, heteroechoic, or hyperechoic masses were identified in all dogs in which ultrasonography was performed. escherichia coli, clostridium sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus  sp, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s intermedius were the most common bacteria isolated from hepatic abscesses. concurrent infections were identified in the biliary tract, spleen, blood, endocardium, lung, prostate gland, peritoneum, lymph nodes, salivary gland, or brain of several dogs. seven dogs died or were euthanatized before definitive treatment could be initiated. one dog was successfully treated with antibiotics and was alive 12 months after medical treatment. six dogs were treated surgically (ie, full or partial liver lobectomy, drainage, abdominal lavage) and medically (ie, antibiotic administration). five of these dogs survived and were alive 12 months after surgery. ultrasonography was used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. clinical implications: hepatic abscesses are rare in dogs, but the clinical signs and clinicopathologic  findings are similar to other inflammatory hepatic disease. ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in all animals in which imaging studies were performed, and was successfully used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. medical and surgical treatments were used successfully to treat hepatic abscesses in dogs.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

TI  == influence of pn2 and pd2 on hd formation by various nitrogenases.
AB  == formation of hd from d2 has been demonstrated with nitrogenase preparations from  azotobacter vinelandii, clostridium pasteurianum, klebsiella pneumoniae, and azospirillum sp. we conclude that the formation of hd from d2 is a general property of nitrogenases. however, the nitrogenases differ in their ki values for d2 (n2 fixation) and in their rates of catalyzing hd formation; among the nitrogenases tested, c. pasteurianum nitrogenase had the lowest activity for formation of hd. when contaminating n2 was removed from the atmospheres above reaction mixtures, less than 1% of the total electron flux in the system was directed to hd formation; hence, we doubt that n2-independent hd formation is significant. a working hypothesis is suggested that operates without invoking an  n2-independent reaction for forming hd.

TI  == dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  == dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. a computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. the computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the api 20e and 50e, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on macconkey's bile salt medium. dinitrogen-fixing enterobacteriaceae (klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the api analytical profile index. nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (azotobacter spp., azospirillum spp., derxia sp., rhodospirillum sp., clostridium sp., and bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. the api tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. the use of the api 20e and 50e tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.

AB  == aspiration of the exudate through the open perforation was performed in 68 children with chronic otitis media. the middle ear aspirate and a swab specimen of the external auditory canal were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. seventy-eight isolates were recovered from the middle ears, 99 from the external  ear canals, and 95 were present at both sites. aerobes only were isolated from 33 patients (48.5%), nine (13.2%) had only anaerobes, and 26 (38%) had a culture that grew both aerobes and anaerobes. there were 99 aerobic isolates. aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, proteus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae. there were 74 anaerobes isolated. anaerobes commonly isolated were anerobic gram-positive cocci, bacteroides sp, and clostridium sp. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial  bacteriology of chronic otitis media in children. cultures collected from the external auditory canals prior to their sterilization can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudates when collected through the open perforation in the tympanic membrane.
