TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.
