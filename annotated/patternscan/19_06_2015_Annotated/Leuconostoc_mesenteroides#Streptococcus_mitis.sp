TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == the microbiology of bandji, palm wine of borassus akeassii from burkina faso: identification and genotypic diversity of yeasts, lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria.
AB  == aim: to investigate physicochemical characteristics and especially genotypic diversity of the main culturable micro-organisms involved in fermentation of sap  from borassus akeassii, a newly identified palm tree from west africa. methods and results: physicochemical characterization was performed using conventional methods. identification of micro-organisms included phenotyping and sequencing of: 26s rrna gene for yeasts, 16s rrna and gyrb genes for lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab). interspecies and intraspecies genotypic diversities of the micro-organisms were screened respectively by amplification of the its1-5.8s rdna-its2/16s-23s rdna its regions and repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr). the physicochemical characteristics of samples were: ph: 3.48-4.12, titratable acidity: 1.67-3.50 mg koh g(-1), acetic acid: 0.16-0.37%, alcohol content: 0.30-2.73%, sugars (degrees brix): 2.70-8.50. yeast included mainly saccharomyces cerevisiae and species of the genera arthroascus, issatchenkia, candida, trichosporon, hanseniaspora, kodamaea, schizosaccharomyces, trigonopsis and galactomyces. lactobacillus plantarum was the predominant lab species. three other species of lactobacillus were also identified as well as isolates of leuconostoc mesenteroides, fructobacillus durionis and streptococcus mitis. acetic acid bacteria included nine species of the genus acetobacter with acetobacter indonesiensis as predominant species. in addition, isolates of gluconobacter oxydans and gluconacetobacter saccharivorans  were also identified. intraspecies diversity was observed for some species of micro-organisms including four genotypes for acet. indonesiensis, three for candida tropicalis and lactobacillus fermentum and two each for s. cerevisiae, trichosporon asahii, candida pararugosa and acetobacter tropicalis. conclusion: fermentation of palm sap from b. akeassii involved multi-yeast-lab-aab cultures at genus, species and intraspecies level. significance and impact of the study: first study describing microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of palm wine from b. akeassii. genotypic diversity of palm wine lab and aab not reported before is demonstrated and this constitutes valuable information for better understanding of the fermentation which can be used to improve the product quality and develop added value by-products.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.
