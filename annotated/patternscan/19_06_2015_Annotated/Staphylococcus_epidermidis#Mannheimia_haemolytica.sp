TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == teat lesions predispose to invasion of the ovine mammary gland by mannheimia haemolytica.
AB  == teat lesions, produced in ewes by an experimental chapping procedure, were found  to facilitate experimental infection with mannheimia haemolytica, as assessed by  observations on infection of the teat skin, teat duct and mammary gland, and on the production of mastitis. the origin of the m. haemolytica strain used (ovine tonsillar or mammary infection) did not appear to influence the results. in a second experiment, in which ewes continued to suckle their lambs but were not deliberately infected, chapping was shown to favour infection by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and m. haemolytica.

TI  == clinical, bacteriological, cytological and pathological features of teat disorders in ewes.
AB  == we describe the features of 13 cases of teat disorders in ewes, as follows: lengthy teats (one case), papilloma infection (two), staphylococcal dermatitis (one), nodules and abscesses (two), teat bites (three), stenosis (one), orf (two), compressed teat (one). mannheimia haemolytica, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans or staphylococcus aureus were isolated from samples. sub-epithelial leucocytic infiltration at the teat duct-teat cistern border, but  not lymphoid nodules, was the salient histological finding in the teat. leucocytic infiltration and destruction of parenchyma were evident in the mammary gland. the results provide field evidence suggesting that teat lesions predispose ewes to mastitis.

TI  == bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (h) versus unhealthy (uh) animals with respiratory signs. the prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper  and lower respiratory tract of h and uh najdi sheep, somali sheep and holstein calves. the characteristics of pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of pasteurella haemolytica were identified in h and uh animals, eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of uh najdi and somali sheep and holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of uh sheep were moraxella spp., pseudomonas pseudomallei, erysipelothrix spp., pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in uh calves were pasteurella haemolytica, actinomyces spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of uh animals, namely actinomyces pyogenes, erysipelothrix spp., p. haemolytica, pasteurella ureae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of  the animals surveyed. of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified p. haemolytica and p. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from uh  as compared to those from h animals. these were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of p. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of p. multocida recovered from healthy animals. the  only biotype of p. haemolytica isolated from h animals was biotype a, while both  biotypes a (88.0% of the isolates) and t (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from uh animals.
