TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == diversity and abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences in forestomach of alpacas (lama pacos) and sheep (ovis aries).
AB  == two bacterial 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed from the forestomach of alpacas and sheep fed alfalfa. after the amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers, equal quantities of pcr products from the same species were mixed and used to construct the two libraries. sequence analysis showed that the  60 clones from alpacas were divided into 27 phylotypes with 25% clones affiliated with eubacterium sp. f1. the 60 clones from sheep were divided into 21 phylotypes with 7 phylotypes affiliated with prevotella ruminicola (40% clones). clones closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, eubacterium sp. f1, clostridium cellobioparum, mogibacterium neglectum, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridiaceae bacterium wn011, clostridium coccoides, clostridium orbiscindens, eubacterium sp. f1, cytophaga sp. dex80-37, treponema bryantii and pelotomaculum sp. fp were only found in the forestomach of alpacas, and those to anaerovorax odorimutans, treponema zioleckii, bifidobacterium indicum, paludibacter propionicigenes, paraprevotella clara, eubacterium siraeum, desulfotomaculum sp. cyp1, clostridium bolteae, clostridium termitidis and clostridiaceae bacterium djf_ls40 only in the rumen of sheep. quantitative real-time pcr revealed that the forestomach of alpacas had significantly lower density of bacteria, with bacterial 16s rrna gene copies (6.89 [log10 (copies per gram of wet weight)]), than that of sheep (7.71,  p<0.01). the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon index (library from alpacas 3.30 and from sheep 3.04). our results showed that there were apparent differences in the bacterial diversity and abundance in the forestomach between alpacas and sheep.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterization of a novel xylanase from the symbiotic sphingobacterium sp. tn19.
AB  == a xylanase-encoding gene, designated xyna19, was cloned from sphingobacterium sp. tn19--a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of batocera horsfieldi larvae--and expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the full-length xyna19 (1,155 bp in length) encodes a 384-residue polypeptide (xyna19) containing a predicted signal peptide of 24 residues and a catalytic domain belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 10 (gh 10). the deduced amino acid sequence of xyna19 is most similar (53.1% identity) to an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from prevotella bryantii b(1)4. phylogenetic analysis of gh 10 bacteroidia xylanases indicated that gh 10 xylanases from sphingobacteria were separated into two clusters, and xyna19 is more closely related to the xylanases of bacteroidia from gut or rumen  than to those of flavobacteria and sphingobacteria from other sources. recombinant xyna19 (r-xyna19) showed apparent optimal activity at ph 6.5 and 45 degrees c. compared with thermophilic and mesophilic counterparts, r-xyna19 was more active at low temperatures, retaining >65% of its maximum activity at 20-28  degrees c and approximately 40% even at 10 degrees c, and modeling indicated that xyna19 has fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. these properties suggest that xyna19 has various potential applications, especially in aquaculture and the food industry.

TI  == design and use of 16s ribosomal dna-directed primers in competitive pcrs to enumerate proteolytic bacteria in the rumen.
AB  == competitive polymerase chain reaction primers were designed for streptococcus, b. fibrisolvens, p. bryantii, eubacterium sp., prevotella, and a universal primer for the eubacteria. dna was extracted from rumen contents collected from eight dairy cows fed four diets: adequate nitrogen, adequate nitrogen plus carbohydrate, low nitrogen, and low nitrogen plus carbohydrate. b. fibrisolvens was significantly higher on the adequate nitrogen plus carbohydrate and the low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diets compared with the other diets, while p. bryantii was significantly higher on the low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diet compared with the adequate nitrogen diet. the population of eubacterium sp. was significantly lower on both the adequate nitrogen plus carbohydrate and low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diets. streptococcus populations were significantly lower on the low nitrogen plus carbohydrate diet compared with all three other diets, whereas there were no significant differences in populations of prevotella or total eubacteria on any of the diets.

TI  == the effect of condensed tannins from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  == five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (ct) purified from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. streptococcus bovis ncfb 2476, eubacterium sp. c124b, prevotella bryantii b14, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, and clostridium proteoclasticum b316t were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg ct x ml(-1) extracted from l. pedunculatus and l. corniculatus. in the absence of ct, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (od) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. growth  of eubacterium sp., p. bryantii, and b. fibrisolvens was inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) more by the ct from l. pedunculatus than by the ct from l. corniculatus. all strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x ml(-1) of the ct from l. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum od600 values than (minus ct) controls, except for s. bovis. at 400  and 600 microg x ml(-1), the addition of ct from l. pedunculatus inhibited (p < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. the growth of eubacterium sp. and p. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h  of incubation (p < 0.001) by 200 microg x ml(-1) of ct from l. corniculatus, but  then declined leading to a significant difference in od values compared with the  controls. at 400 microg x ml(-1), the ct from l. corniculatus reduced (p < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except s. bovis, while 600 microg x ml(-1) inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. to study the mechanism of ct action, the degradation of the large subunit (lsu) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco; fraction 1 leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or rubisco were preincubated with ct  extracted from l. corniculatus and l. pedunculatus. both preincubations decreased lsu degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (peg) addition. addition of peg to ct-rubisco preincubations negated the effects of ct, while peg addition to ct-bacteria preincubations did not. this implies that the ct-bacterial interaction is stronger than the ct-rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. also, l. pedunculatus ct reduced the degradation of the lsu to a greater extent than the ct from l. corniculatus when  preincubated with bacteria.

TI  == diversity of extracellular proteolytic activities among prevotella species from the rumen.
AB  == the current research was aimed at comparing proteolytic activities among ruminal  prevotella spp. growth rates of prevotella sp. 2202, prevotella ruminicola d31d,  p. brevis ga33, p. albensis m384, and p. bryantii b(1)4 varied with n source, and no one n source produced the fastest growth in all species. proteolytic activity  was greatest with casein compared with peptides, aa, and nh(4)cl in all species.  proteolytic activity of prevotella sp. 2202, p. brevis ga33, and p. bryantii b(1)4 was modulated by n source. with gelatin co-polymerized sds-page, the extracellular activities of the prevotella spp. showed wide variation in number,  size, and type of proteases. prevotella sp. 2202 and p. albensis m384 produced metalloproteases of low molecular weight (40 kda). p. ruminicola d31d produced one cysteine protease (100-200 kda) and two metalloproteases (90-100 kda). p. brevis ga33 generated a diffuse clearing zone (95-160 kda) containing serine, cysteine, and metalloproteases. p. bryantii b(1)4 produced a metalloprotease greater than 200 kda in size. the molecular sizes provided are estimations and served only to differentiate among the bacterial species in this study. large variations in proteolytic activities among species and the known genetic diversity of the prevotella taxon suggested that targeting this bacterial assemblage for genetic manipulation in order to alter the bacterial impact on ruminal protein degradation would be difficult.

TI  == glutamate dehydrogenase activity profiles for type strains of ruminal prevotella  spp.
AB  == the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) activities for the type strains of prevotella ruminicola (strain 23), prevotella brevis (strain ga33), and prevotella bryantii  (strain b(1)4) were assessed by a combination of enzyme assays and analysis of migration patterns of gdh proteins following nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. unlike results with most other prokaryotes, but similar to results with other members of the family bacteroidaceae, nadph-utilizing specific activity was greatest in all species following ammonia-limited growth. similar also to previous findings with p. bryantii, the nad(p)h-utilizing gdh activity of p. ruminicola can be attributed to a single protein. however, p. brevis produces  an additional gdh protein(s) in response to growth with peptides. these results conclusively demonstrate that all type strains of the ruminal prevotella sp. grouping possess gdh activity.

TI  == phenotypic diversity among ruminal isolates of prevotella ruminicola: proposal of prevotella brevis sp. nov., prevotella bryantii sp. nov., and prevotella albensis sp. nov. and redefinition of prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == selected phenotypic characteristics of isolates of prevotella ruminicola (formerly bacteroides ruminicola) were studied in order to establish whether the  characteristics of genotypic strain groups established previously on the basis of 16s ribosomal dna sequences differed systematically. among strains formerly considered p. ruminicola subsp. brevis, strains related to strain ga33t (t = type strain) typically failed to produce carboxymethyl cellulase (cmcase) activity detectable by plate assays and failed to ferment xylose, while strains related to strain b14t produced abundant cmcase and fermented xylose. we propose that strains related to ga33t, which have dna g + c contents between 45 and 51 mol%, should be assigned to a new species, prevotella brevis, and that strains related  to b14t, which have dna g + c contents between 39 and 43 mol%, should be assigned to another new species, prevotella bryantii. most of the isolates formerly classified as p. ruminicola subsp. ruminicola strains produced cmcase and had dna g + c contents between 45 and 51 mol%, and we propose that these organisms should be placed in the redefined species p. ruminicola. a small group of isolates that  have lower g + c contents are assigned to another new species, prevotella albensis. most p. brevis and p. bryantii strains produced abundatn extracellular  dnase activity. proteinase activities (as determined by [14c]casein hydrolysis) varied widely between strains, and p. brevis strains exhibited the highest mean activity. all strains produced dipeptidyl peptidase activity, but the relative activities against different peptide substrates exhibited by p. bryantii, p. albensis, and p. brevis differed systematically. the phenotypic differences among the newly defined species suggest that they may occupy distinct niches within the rumen ecosystem.
