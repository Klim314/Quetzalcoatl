TI  == clostridiolysin s, a post-translationally modified biotoxin from clostridium botulinum.
AB  == through elaboration of its botulinum toxins, clostridium botulinum produces clinical syndromes of infant botulism, wound botulism, and other invasive infections. using comparative genomic analysis, an orphan nine-gene cluster was identified in c. botulinum and the related foodborne pathogen clostridium sporogenes that resembled the biosynthetic machinery for streptolysin s, a key virulence factor from group a streptococcus responsible for its hallmark beta-hemolytic phenotype. genetic complementation, in vitro reconstitution, mass  spectral analysis, and plasmid intergrational mutagenesis demonstrate that the streptolysin s-like gene cluster from clostridium sp. is responsible for the biogenesis of a novel post-translationally modified hemolytic toxin, clostridiolysin s.

TI  == noncollagenous region of the streptococcal collagen-like protein is a trimerization domain that supports refolding of adjacent homologous and heterologous collagenous domains.
AB  == proper folding of the (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence of animal collagens requires adjacent n- or c-terminal noncollagenous trimerization domains which often contain coiled-coil or beta sheet structure. collagen-like proteins have been found recently in a number of bacteria, but little is known about their folding mechanism. the scl2 collagen-like protein from streptococcus pyogenes has an n-terminal globular domain, designated v(sp), adjacent to its triple-helix domain. the v(sp) domain is required for proper refolding of the scl2 protein in  vitro. here, recombinant v(sp) domain alone is shown to form trimers with a significant alpha-helix content and to have a thermal stability of t(m) = 45 degrees c. examination of a new construct shows that the v(sp) domain facilitates efficient in vitro refolding only when it is located n-terminal to the triple-helix domain but not when c-terminal to the triple-helix domain. fusion of the v(sp) domain n-terminal to a heterologous (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence from clostridium perfringens led to correct folding and refolding of this triple-helix, which was unable to fold into a triple-helical, soluble protein on  its own. these results suggest that placement of a functional trimerization module adjacent to a heterologous gly-xaa-yaa repeating sequence can lead to proper folding in some cases but also shows specificity in the relative location  of the trimerization and triple-helix domains. this information about their modular nature can be used in the production of novel types of bacterial collagen for biomaterial applications.

TI  == mortality in pennsylvania captive elk (cervus elaphus): 1998-2006.
AB  == the necropsy records of 65 elk ranging from 1 day to 13(1/2) years of age were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. the animal carcasses were submitted from 22 separate pennsylvania elk farms over an approximately 8-year period. the most common causes of mortality in animals in which the cause of death was determined were gastrointestinal parasitism (21 cases), pneumonia (7 cases), enterocolitis (5 cases), malnutrition (5 cases), and rumenitis/acidosis (5 cases). the cause of death was undetermined in 4 of the 65  elk. nematode organisms (20 cases) were the primary parasites identified in cases of mortality owing to gastrointestinal parasitism. arcanobacterium pyogenes (3 cases), escherichia coli (3 cases), and streptococcus sp. (2 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lung in the cases of pneumonia. fungal organisms, consistent with aspergillus sp. were present histologically within the pulmonary lesions in 5 cases. bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included clostridium perfringens (2 cases), e. coli (1 case), salmonella newport  (1 case) and salmonella thompson (1 case). the majority (56.3%) of the death loss in elk of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 71.4% of the gastrointestinal parasitism, 60.0% of the malnutrition, 60.0% of the enterocolitis, and 57.1% of the pneumonia cases occurring in animals within this  age range. in conclusion, gastrointestinal parasitism, pneumonia, malnutrition, enterocolitis and rumenitis/acidosis were considered the most common causes of death in captive elk in this study.

TI  == immunohistochemical evidence of clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, and group  a streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  == severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. we performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (ihc) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft  tissue infections in scotland and ireland in 2000. the ihc assays used antibodies against clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and bacillus anthracis. intact bacilli and granular clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. a variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 ihc-positive cases. staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where s aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. group a streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which streptococcus pyogenes and s aureus were isolated. by using ihc, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their  anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  == tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. it is endemic in many countries in latin america, the  caribbean and sub-saharan africa. although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. we conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in fortaleza,  capital of ceara state (northeast brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. the most common species were staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). bacillus sp., enteroccous faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we  detected peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. these results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. it is proposed that t. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. to prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == a54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  == a54145 complex is made up of eight factors; a, a1, b, b1, c, d, e, and f which were active in vitro (mic 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive aerobic organisms. the complex, factor b and b1 were found  to be active against two strains of clostridium perfringens. a calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. resistance build-up was seen when staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of a54145 antibiotics. this resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. factor a was very effective against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ed50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). factor b was more active against s. pyogenes in vivo (sc ed50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == empedopeptin (bmy-28117), a new depsipeptide antibiotic. i. production, isolation and properties.
AB  == empedopeptin is a new antibiotic produced by empedobacter haloabium nov. sp. (atcc 31962). it is a water-soluble depsipeptide antibiotic containing eight amino acid residues and a c14-fatty acid moiety in the molecule. although structurally unrelated, empedopeptin and vancomycin have similar antimicrobial spectra against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria including antibiotic-resistant strains. empedopeptin is highly active in vivo in mice against systemic infections of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and  clostridium perfringens. empedopeptin is not absorbed orally.

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in zaria, nigeria.
AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
