TI  == essential genes in the core genome of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) remains a major public health burden worldwide, infecting over 750 million people leading to over 500,000 deaths annually. gas pathogenesis is complex, involving genetically distinct gas  strains and multiple infection sites. to overcome fastidious genetic manipulations and accelerate pathogenesis investigations in gas, we developed a mariner-based system (krmit) for en masse monitoring of complex mutant pools by transposon sequencing (tn-seq). highly saturated transposant libraries (krmit insertions in ca. every 25 nucleotides) were generated in two distinct gas clinical isolates, a serotype m1t1 invasive strain 5448 and a nephritogenic serotype m49 strain nz131, and analyzed using a bayesian statistical model to predict gas essential genes, identifying sets of 227 and 241 of those genes in 5448 and nz131, respectively. a large proportion of gas essential genes corresponded to key cellular processes and metabolic pathways, and 177 were found conserved within the gas core genome established from 20 available gas genomes. selected essential genes were validated using conditional-expression mutants. finally, comparison to previous essentiality analyses in s. sanguinis and s. pneumoniae revealed significant overlaps, providing valuable insights for the development of new antimicrobials to treat infections by gas and other pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == evaluation of application possibility of water containing organic acids for chemical denture cleaning for older adults.
AB  == aim: the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the application possibility of water containing organic acids (woa), made by some organic acids used as food  additives, for chemical denture cleaning for older adults by microbial investigation. methods: using an in vitro biofilm study, we determined the effects of woa on streptococcus sanguinis, s. pneumoniae and candida albicans attached to heat-cured acrylic resins. specimens were divided into three groups as follows: control group (tw), commercial denture cleaner group (dc) and woa group (woa). specimens were treated with each for 5 min, 30 min or 8 h, and the numbers of attached microbes were determined by counting colony-forming units or  adenosine triphosphate analysis. using an in vivo biofilm study, we studied the effects of these same solutions on 60 complete dentures. the dentures were divided randomly and blindness into three groups as described above, and treated  for 10 min. the numbers of microbes attached to dentures before and after treatment were determined by counting colony-forming units. results: for the in vitro biofilm study, there were significant differences in the numbers of microbes between woa and tw, although there were no significant differences between woa and dc except for c. albicans. for the in vivo biofilm study, there were significant differences between woa, dc and tw, although there was no significant difference between woa and dc. conclusion: we conclude that water containing organic acids exerts antimicrobial effects as strong as commercial denture cleaner, and it has an application possibility of use for safe chemical denture cleaning for older adults. geriatr gerontol int 2015; : -.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == comparison of genes required for h2o2 resistance in streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) is produced by several members of the genus streptococcus mainly through the pyruvate oxidase spxb under aerobic growth conditions. the acute toxic nature of h2o2 raises the interesting question of how streptococci cope with intrinsically produced h2o2, which subsequently accumulates in the microenvironment and threatens the closely surrounding population. here, we investigate the h2o2 susceptibility of oral streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis and elucidate potential mechanisms of how they protect themselves from the deleterious effect of h2o2. both organisms are considered primary colonizers and occupy the same intraoral niche making them potential targets for h2o2 produced by other species. we demonstrate that s. gordonii produces relatively more h2o2 and has a greater ability for resistance to h2o2 stress. functional studies show that, unlike in streptococcus pneumoniae, h2o2 resistance is not dependent on a functional spxb and confirms the important  role of the ferritin-like dna-binding protein dps. however, the observed increased h2o2 resistance of s. gordonii over s. sanguinis is likely to be caused by an oxidative stress protection machinery present even under anaerobic conditions, while s. sanguinis requires a longer period of time for adaptation. the ability to produce more h2o2 and be more resistant to h2o2 might aid s. gordonii in the competitive oral biofilm environment, since it is lower in abundance yet manages to survive quite efficiently in the oral biofilm.

TI  == amplification of bacteria-induced platelet activation is triggered by fcgammariia, integrin alphaiibbeta3, and platelet factor 4.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to platelets is mediated via a range of strain-specific bacterial surface proteins that bind to a variety of platelet receptors. it is unclear how these interactions lead to platelet activation. we demonstrate a critical role for the immune receptor fcgammariia, alphaiibbeta3, and src and syk tyrosine kinases in platelet activation by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. fcgammariia activation is dependent on immunoglobulin g (igg) and alphaiibbeta3 engagement. moreover, feedback agonists adenosine 5'-diphosphate and thromboxane a2 are mandatory for platelet aggregation. additionally, platelet factor 4 (pf4) binds to bacteria and reduces the lag time for aggregation, and gray platelet syndrome alpha-granule-deficient platelets do not aggregate to 4 of 5 bacterial strains. we propose that fcgammariia-mediated activation is a common  response mechanism used against a wide range of bacteria, and that release of secondary mediators and pf4 serve as a positive feedback mechanism for activation through an igg-dependent pathway.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == [a novel typing method and scheme for streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  == study aim: to introduce a novel molecular pcr method for the typing of streptococcus pneumonia in the national reference laboratory (nrl) for streptococcal infections. material and methods: strains of streptococcus pneumoniae are referred to the nrl from different regions of the czech republic.  generally, the identification and typing are based on strain morphology, optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, latex agglutination, and the quellung reaction.  since 2012, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mpcr) assay has been introduced. the novel assay was tested on 210 s. pneumoniae isolates and 8 isolates of the related species s. pseudopneumoniae, s. sanguinis, and s. oralis. results: the nrl for streptococcal infections has included a novel mpcr assay in  the algorithm of s. pneumoniae identification and typing. the mpcr assay was able to identify and type any pneumococcal strain from the study collection, with the  isolates of the related species remaining negative. the mpcr assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in this study. the pcr appeared to be an excellent tool for s. pneumoniae typing. conclusion: until recently, s. pneumoniae serotypes and serogroups were differentiated using a serological approach (quellung reaction), but the nrl for streptococcal infections has switched to a novel mpcr assay. this molecular tool improves s. pneumoniae typing, making it more accurate.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == [comparison of culture and real-time pcr methods in the detection of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. this study was aimed to compare the detection rate  of s.pneumoniae and h.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. a total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. the samples were inoculated and incubated in bactec ped plus blood culture bottles and bactec 9120 system (bd diagnostic systems, md), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. for the molecular diagnosis of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and hib capsule region, respectively were amplified by rt-pcr (lightcycler, roche diagnostics, germany). h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. in addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguinis, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans) were also isolated. on the other hand h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with rt-pcr, respectively. there was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae with rt-pcr compared to culture methods. when culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of rt-pcr in the detection of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. as a result, rt-pcr was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute  otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == regulation of neuraminidase expression in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == spxa1 involved in hydrogen peroxide production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is one of the most common agents of infective endocarditis. spx proteins are a group of global regulators that negatively or positively control global transcription initiation. in this study, we characterized the spxa1 gene in s. sanguinis sk36. the spxa1 null mutant displayed opaque colony morphology, reduced hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) production, and reduced antagonistic activity against streptococcus mutans ua159  relative to the wild type strain. the deltaspxa1 mutant also demonstrated decreased tolerance to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses. further analysis revealed that deltaspxa1 also exhibited a approximately 5-fold reduction in competitiveness in an animal model of endocarditis. microarray studies indicated that expression of several oxidative stress genes was downregulated in  the deltaspxa1 mutant. the expression of spxb and nox was significantly decreased in the deltaspxa1 mutant compared with the wild type. these results indicate that spxa1 plays a major role in h(2)o(2) production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in s. sanguinis sk36. the second spx gene, spxa2, was also found in s. sanguinis sk36. the spxa2 null mutant was found to be defective for growth under normal conditions and showed sensitivity to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses.

TI  == genome-wide essential gene identification in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == a clear perception of gene essentiality in bacterial pathogens is pivotal for identifying drug targets to combat emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for synthetic biology, and for understanding the origins of life. we have constructed a comprehensive set of deletion mutants and  systematically identified a clearly defined set of essential genes for streptococcus sanguinis. our results were confirmed by growing s. sanguinis in minimal medium and by double-knockout of paralogous or isozyme genes. careful examination revealed that these essential genes were associated with only three basic categories of biological functions: maintenance of the cell envelope, energy production, and processing of genetic information. our finding was subsequently validated in two other pathogenic streptococcal species, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans and in two other gram-positive  pathogens, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. our analysis has thus led to a simplified model that permits reliable prediction of gene essentiality.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == the streptococcus sanguinis competence regulon is not required for infective endocarditis virulence in a rabbit model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an important component of dental plaque and a leading  cause of infective endocarditis. genetic competence in s. sanguinis requires a quorum sensing system encoded by the early comcde genes, as well as late genes controlled by the alternative sigma factor, comx. previous studies of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans have identified functions for the >100-gene com regulon in addition to dna uptake, including virulence. we investigated this possibility in s. sanguinis. strains deleted for the comcde or  comx master regulatory genes were created. using a rabbit endocarditis model in conjunction with a variety of virulence assays, we determined that both mutants possessed infectivity equivalent to that of a virulent control strain, and that measures of disease were similar in rabbits infected with each strain. these results suggest that the com regulon is not required for s. sanguinis infective endocarditis virulence in this model. we propose that the different roles of the  s. sanguinis, s. pneumoniae, and s. mutans com regulons in virulence can be understood in relation to the pathogenic mechanisms employed by each species.

AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.
AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == physiological and molecular characterization of genetic competence in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a major component of the oral flora and an important cause of infective endocarditis. although s. sanguinis is naturally competent, genome sequencing has suggested significant differences in the s. sanguinis competence system relative to those of other streptococci. an s. sanguinis mutant possessing an in-frame deletion in the comc gene, which encodes competence-stimulating peptide (csp), was created. addition of synthetic csp induced competence in this strain. gene expression in this strain was monitored by microarray analysis at multiple time-points from 2.5 to 30 min after csp addition, and verified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. over 200 genes were identified whose expression was altered at least two-fold in at least one time point, with the majority upregulated. the 'late' response was typical of that seen in previous studies. however, comparison of the 'early' response in s. sanguinis with that of other oral streptococci revealed unexpected differences with regard to the number of genes induced, the nature of  those genes, and their putative upstream regulatory sequences. streptococcus sanguinis possesses a comparatively limited early response, which may define a minimal streptococcal competence regulatory circuit.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == decontamination efficacy of antiseptic agents on in vivo grown biofilms on rough  titanium surfaces.
AB  == objective: four common antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their efficacy in  reduction of aerobic bacteria intraorally grown in biofilms on rough titanium samples. the solutions investigated contained chlorhexidine, essential oil, octenidine, or citric acid. method and materials: twenty volunteers wore splints  with titanium sleeves intraorally for 10 days. following irrigation with the antiseptics, the sleeves were removed and biofilm samples were taken by swabbing. the bacteria were first examined microscopically by gram staining. these samples  from the surfaces were then cultured under aerobic conditions to identify and quantify the colonizing bacteria. results: compared to untreated controls, significant (p < .05) differences in antimicrobial efficacy were observed for the different regimens depending on bacterial species or even the subtype. the reduction rates achieved varied from 30.0% after 2 minutes of rinsing with chlorhexidine to 99.8% after 8 minutes of rinsing with octenidine. conclusion: the irrigation regimens studied in this investigation reduced bacterial colonization in a mature biofilm grown intraorally on rough titanium surfaces. the highest absolute reduction was achieved after 8 minutes, but only the 2-minute reduction rates are significant for clinical practice. taking this into  consideration, the distinct decontamination efficacy of octenidine and citric acid is evident.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == structural basis of the zinc- and terbium-mediated inhibition of ferroxidase activity in dps ferritin-like proteins.
AB  == streptococcus suis dpr is an iron-binding protein involved in oxidative stress resistance. it belongs to the bacterial dps protein family whose members form dodecameric assemblies. previous studies have shown that zinc and terbium inhibit iron incorporation in listeria innocua dps protein. in order to gain structural insights into the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium, the crystal structures of streptococcus suis dpr complexes with these ions were determined at 1.8 a and  2.1 a, respectively. both ions were found to bind at the ferroxidase center and in the same location as iron. in addition, a novel zinc-binding site formed by his40 and his44 was identified. both his residues were found to be present within all known streptococcus suis dpr variants and in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus sanguinis dpr proteins. amino acid sequence alignment of dpr with other dps family members revealed that his44 is highly conserved, in contrast to his40. the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium on iron oxidation in dpr was studied in vitro, and it was found that both ions at concentrations >0.2 mm almost completely abolish iron binding. these results provide a structural basis for the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium in the dps family of proteins, and suggest a potential role of the dps proteins in zinc  detoxification mechanisms involving the second zinc-binding site.

TI  == the utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  == there is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. in this study, we utilized an e. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pvt1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pvpt-ctag  and pvpt-ntag, with each set containing five affinity tags (gst, gfp, hsv, t7 and nano) that can be fused to either the c- or n-terminus of a target protein. a putative glycosyltransferase (gtf2) essential for fap1 glycosylation was used to  demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain streptococcus  parasanguinis. gfp and t7 tags were readily expressed in s. parasanguinis as either an n- or c-terminal fusion to gtf2. only the c- terminal fusion of gst and hsv were able to be identified in s. parasanguinis. the nano tag was not detected in either e. coli or s. parasanguinis. genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the nano-tagged gtf2 at its n-terminal fusion. using a t7-tagged gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion  cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including s. mutans, s. pneumoniae and s. sanguinis. therefore, the  expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in fap1 biogenesis in s. parasanguinis, but also to  study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pvt1666 replicates.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == [prognostic factors of clinical outcome of the tuberculous pleural effusion].
AB  == background and objective: to date, no studies have been reported analyzing the prognosis factors related to severe clinical complications in tuberculous pleural effusion (tpe). we studied clinical, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological factors that could help establish the clinical outcome of tpe. patients and method: retrospective study of > or = 15 years old patients diagnosed of tpe along 9 years. patients were classified in two groups: a group without complications (ncg), and a group with complications (cg) on the basis of  residual pleural thickening (rpt) > or = 10 mm, need of surgery or death. results: sixty six patients were included, mean age 35.3 years, 53% male, 47 in the ncg group and 19 in the cg (1 died, 4 needed surgery, 14 had rpt). the evolution of clinical symptoms was 20.7 days in the ncg and 45.6 in the cg. 94.7% of the cg patients had loculations (23.4% in the ncg). we observed significant differences in the ph (7.34 vs 7.11), glucose (78 vs 30 mg/dl) and lactic dehydrogenase (925 vs 3,235 u/l). conclusions: severe tpe has similar characteristics to complicated parapneumonic pleural effusion. loculations, ph <  7.25 and glucose < 50 mg/dl were indicative of a poorly outcome in our study.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis may react with lancefield group f antiserum.
AB  == lancefield group f streptococci have been found almost exclusively as members of  the 'streptococcus milleri' group, although they have been reported very occasionally in some other streptococcal species. among 302 patients with bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci over a 6-year period, three cases were caused by streptococcus sinensis (type strain hku4t, hku5 and hku6). all three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. gene sequencing showed no base differences between the  16s rrna gene sequences of hku5 and hku6 and that of hku4t. all three strains were gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. all grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h  incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. lancefield grouping revealed that hku5 and hku6 were lancefield group f, but hku4t was non-groupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f or g antisera. hku4t was identified by the vitek system (gpi), api system (20 strep) and atb system (id32 strep) as 99 % streptococcus intermedius, 51.3 % s. intermedius and 99.9 % streptococcus anginosus, respectively. using the same tests, hku5 was identified as 87 % streptococcus sanguinis/streptococcus gordonii, 59 % streptococcus salivarius and 99.6 % s. anginosus, respectively, and hku6 as 87 % s. sanguinis/s. gordonii, 77 % streptococcus pneumoniae and 98.3 % s. anginosus, respectively. the present data  revealed that a proportion of lancefield group f streptococci could be s. sinensis. lancefield group f streptococci should not be automatically reported as 's. milleri'.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by streptococcal iga1 proteases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

TI  == antigenic as well as nonantigenic stimuli induce similar middle ear responses in  the rat.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: the observation that during otitis media many different types of micro-organisms have been cultured from effusions indicate that, once present in the middle ear cavity, most types of micro-organisms are able to trigger an inflammatory reaction leading to otitis media. the present study was designed to determine the middle ear response after injection of different substances into the middle ear cavity. study design: to determine whether and to  what extent an inflammatory response of the middle ear depends on the entering agent, the response in the tympanic cavity was studied by otomicroscopy and histological examination after inoculation of various substances. methods: lewis  rats were inoculated in transtympanic fashion either with live or heat-killed bacteria (pathogenic and nonpathogenic), keyhole limpet hemocyanin, active charcoal, or saline. the mucosal response of the challenged middle ears was studied histologically. results: irrespective of the inoculated substance, no essential differences in the mucosal response were found. the intensity of the inflammatory response was greater when live bacteria were inoculated. conclusions: the present study demonstrates that any substance reaching the middle ear cavity is likely to induce otitis media. these observations emphasize  the role of the eustachian tube as "porte d'entree" in the pathogenesis of this disorder. determination of specific aspects of the eustachian tube involved in protection or in facilitating bacterial translocation will be important for the understanding of the pathogenesis of otitis media and the subsequent development  of new therapeutic strategies. in addition, elucidation of bacterial factors involved in the process of colonization and translocation will be of equal importance.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

AB  == in order to investigate the role of infectious agents in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract disease in thoroughbred racehorses, a matched case-control study was conducted. cases were identified by the presence of coughing, and were  compared to a control population matched on time of sample collection and location within the same training establishment. tracheal wash samples were collected from 100 cases and 148 controls. case horses were more likely than controls to have endoscopic and cytological evidence of airway inflammation. there was no significant association between serological evidence of infection by commonly implicated respiratory viruses and coughing. similarly, mycoplasma were  rarely isolated and were not associated with disease. in contrast, there was a strong association between isolation of greater than a total of 10(3) colony-forming units/ml of tracheal wash and coughing. individual bacterial species associated with disease included streptococcus zooepidemicus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus suis, streptococcus sanguis, pasteurella  spp and bordetella bronchiseptica. this study provides evidence of the role of bacterial infection in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract inflammation in racehorses. however, in 58% of cases, few or no bacteria were isolated. hence, at the time of identification of disease, there was no evidence of viral, bacterial  or mycoplasmal infection in the majority of coughing horses. the aetiology of the signs observed in these horses requires further investigation.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == differential patterns of apoptosis in resolving and nonresolving bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == infection with either streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus pneumoniae type 25 causes acute pneumonitis in rats. pneumonia caused by s. sanguis resolves over the course of 8 d, whereas pneumonia caused by s. pneumoniae type 25 progresses to fibrosis. to examine the role of apoptosis in these models, we performed assays with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-uridine nucleotide end-labeling technique on tissue sections from rat lungs at various times, and quantified the results with image analysis. apoptosis was a feature of both the acute and resolving stages of pneumonia. the pattern and extent of apoptosis were similar in both models during the acute stage, and the number of apoptotic nuclei increased in both models through 4 d after infection. although there were differences in the cellular pattern of apoptosis after 2 d and 4 d of infection,  the extent of apoptosis was the same in both models. after 8 d, major differences were observed. in the resolving model, apoptosis was limited primarily to an abscess in the base of the lung. in the nonresolving model, apoptosis was persistent. we also found that cyclin-dependent kinase-5 expression is upregulated during apoptosis induced by bacterial infection. these data indicate  that the location and timing of apoptosis may determine whether pneumonia resolves or progresses to fibrosis.

TI  == cleavage of a recombinant human immunoglobulin a2 (iga2)-iga1 hybrid antibody by  certain bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

TI  == multiple infections in carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
AB  == background: chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and recently, periodontal disease, have been associated with human atherosclerosis. porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus sanguis are major pathogens associated with periodontitis, a common chronic inflammatory condition in adults. investigators have found that these infectious agents may influence vascular cell functions by inducing thrombus formation, vascular cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell death. methods and results: the main purpose of our study was to investigate the relation between the presence of multiple infectious agents in human carotid endarterectomy specimens and pathoanatomic features of the corresponding carotid plaques. histologically, plaque rupture of the fibrous cap  and communication of the luminal thrombus with the central necrotic lipid core was seen in or at proximity to the macrophage-rich shoulder (unstable plaque region). thrombus within the lipid core without plaque rupture was occasionally found near the internal elastic lamina, associated with increased vascularity and lymphocytic infiltrate. apoptosis, as detected by both the immunohistochemical staining of apoptosis-related proteins and in situ labeling of internucleosomally degraded dna, was common in atherosclerotic plaques. immunostainings for c pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, p gingivalis, and s sanguis  were positive in the carotid plaques. from 1 to 4 organisms were found in the same specimen. the micro-organisms were immunolocalized in plaque shoulders and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, associated with ulcer and thrombus formation, and adjacent to areas of strong labeling for apoptotic bodies. conclusions: our data  provide evidence that multiple infectious agents may be found in atherosclerotic  plaques, and sometimes in the same specimen. the current study is the first to report the detection of 2 major odontopathogens, p gingivalis and s sanguis, in atherosclerotic plaques. the immunolocalization of these micro-organisms within unstable plaque regions and their association with plaque ulceration, thrombosis, and apoptosis in vascular cells are intriguing. multiple infectious agents may alter vascular cell function and provide a "trigger" for acute ischemic stroke events. further evidence from human studies and animal models will be needed.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

AB  == the heterogeneous bacterial group known as oral streptococci was screened for the presence of cellular polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid. this compound was detected in phenol extracts of lyophilized cells by an immunoassay in which polyglycerolphosphate-specific monoclonal antibody was used. polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid occurred in all 86 strains of  oral streptococci examined except the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains. this confirms the findings of rosan (b. rosan, science 201:918-920, 1978) and hamada et al. (s. hamada, j. mizuno, s. kotani, and m. torii, fems microbiol. lett. 8:93-96, 1980), is consistent with the results of the taxonomic study of oral streptococci performed by kilian et al. (m. kilian, l. mikkelsen, and j. henrichsen, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 39:471-484, 1989), who  emended the descriptions of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, and s. mitis, and reflects the phylogenetic relationship among s. mitis, s. oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

TI  == identification, cloning, and sequencing of the immunoglobulin a1 protease gene of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the pneumococcus expresses a protease that hydrolyzes human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1). a gene for iga1 protease was identified from a plasmid library of pneumococcal dna because of the effect of its overexpression on the colony morphology of streptococcus pneumoniae. the deduced 1,964-amino-acid sequence is  highly homologous to that of the iga1 protease from streptococcus sanguis. the similarity to the s. sanguis enzyme and the presence of a putative zinc-binding site suggest that the pneumococcal enzyme is a metalloprotease. the two streptococcal sequences differ in a hydrophilic region with 10 tandem repeats of  a 20-mer in s. sanguis, which is replaced by a similar but less repetitive sequence in s. pneumoniae. antiserum reactive with the pneumococcal iga1 protease was used to demonstrate that the majority of the protein is cell associated. the  expression and function of this gene were confirmed by insertional mutagenesis. interruption of the chromosomal gene resulted in loss of expression of an approximately 200-kda protein and complete elimination of detectable iga1 protease activity.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus pneumoniae immunoglobulin a1 protease gene  (iga) and its translation product.
AB  == bacterial immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases constitute a very heterogenous group of extracellular endopeptidases which specifically cleave human iga1 in the hinge region. here we report that the iga1 protease gene, iga, of streptococcus pneumoniae is homologous to that of streptococcus sanguis. by using the s. sanguis iga gene as hybridization probe, the corresponding gene from a clinical isolate of s. pneumoniae was isolated in an escherichia coli lambda phage library. a lysate of e. coli infected with hybridization-positive recombinant phages possessed iga1-cleaving activity. the complete sequence of the s. pneumoniae iga gene was determined. an open reading frame with a strongly biased  codon usage and having the potential of encoding a protein of 1,927 amino acids with a molecular mass of 215,023 da was preceded by a potential -10 promoter sequence and a putative shine-dalgarno sequence. a putative signal peptide was found in the n-terminal end of the protein. the amino acid sequence similarity to the s. sanguis iga1 protease indicated that the pneumococcal iga1 protease is a zn-metalloproteinase. the primary structures of the two streptococcal iga1 proteases were quite different in the n-terminal parts, and both proteins contained repeat structures in this region. using a novel assay for iga1 protease activity upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we demonstrated that the secreted iga1 protease was present in several different molecular forms ranging in size from approximately 135 to 220 kda. in addition, interstrain differences in the sizes of the pneumococcal iga1 proteases were detected. southern blot analyses suggested that the s. pneumoniae iga gene is highly heterogenous within the species.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

TI  == the fima locus of streptococcus parasanguis encodes an atp-binding membrane transport system.
AB  == the gene encoding fima, a 36 kda fimbrial adhesion of streptococcus parasanguis fw213, is highly conserved in all four genetic groups of sanguis streptococci. fima-like peptides were produced by all strains tested. the nucleotide sequence directly upstream of fima contains two open reading frames, orf5 and orf1, whose  deduced protein products are homologous to members of a superfamily of atp-binding cassette membrane transport proteins, including both prokaryotic and  eukaryotic uptake and export systems. the amino acid sequence of fima contains the consensus prolipoprotein cleavage site (lxxc) common to the 'periplasmic' binding proteins of gram-positive transport systems. the deduced product of orf5  is a 28.6 kda membrane-associated protein that has the consensus binding site for atp (gxxgxgks). it shares significant homology with amie of streptococcus pneumoniae as well as with escherichia coli proteins involved in iron(iii) uptake. allelic-replacement mutagenesis of orf5 resulted in greatly increased resistance to aminopterin. these data demonstrate functionality with the amie locus as well. the deduced product of orf1 is an extremely hydrophobic integral membrane protein of 30.8 kda with a pattern of six potential membrane-spanning regions, typical of a component of these types of transport system. the nucleotide sequence downstream of fima, orf3, encodes a 20 kda protein having 78% identity with the 20 kda protein encoded downstream of ssab, a fima homologue in  s. sanguis 12. it also exhibits significant homology with bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (bcp) of e. coli k-12. allelic-replacement mutagenesis in the fima locus of fw213 showed that (i) expression of fima was initiated at a site far upstream of the fima start codon, and (ii) expression of fima was not linked to expression of orf3. northern blots probed with internal fragments of orf5, orf1, fima or orf3 hybridized to the same transcript of 3.3 kb, which suggested that these loci were transcribed as a polycistronic message. the orf3 probe also hybridized to a 540 bp transcript consistent with the size of orf3 alone and supportive of the mutagenesis data of non-linkage. strains mutated in fima continued to produce fimbriae, indicating that fima was not the fimbrial structural subunit. immunoelectron microscopy revealed fima was localized at the  tips of the fimbriae of fw213. this is the first study that demonstrates that an  adhesin which binds a bacterial cell to a substrate is associated with an atp-binding cassette.

AB  == human oral viridans group streptococci that coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii pk606 express surface proteins related to scaa, the coaggregation-mediating adhesin of streptococcus gordonii pk488 (r. n. andersen,  n. ganeshkumar, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 61:981-987, 1993). the nucleotide sequence of the 6,125-bp ecori insert of pra1, containing scaa, the gene encoding scaa, was determined. six open reading frames (orfs) were identified. the orientation of four orfs, two upstream (orf 1 and orf 2) and one  downstream (orf 4) of scaa (orf 3), indicated transcription in one direction, whereas orf 5 and orf 6 were transcribed divergently. computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences identified a consensus binding site for atp (gxxgxgks) in the putative 28,054-da protein encoded by orf 1. orf 2 potentially  encoded a hydrophobic protein of 29,705 da with six potential membrane-spanning regions. scaa was 310 amino acids, 34,787 da, and contained the lipoprotein consensus sequence lxxc, also reported for the scaa-related proteins ssab, fima,  and psaa from streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus parasanguis fw213, and streptococcus pneumoniae r36a, respectively. orf 4 potentially encoded a 163-amino-acid protein of 17,912 da, which was nearly identical to the downstream adjacent gene products of ssab, fima, and psaa. no significant homology with other proteins was found with the putative orf 5 gene product, a 229-amino-acid protein of 25,107 da. orf 6 was incomplete and encoded a protein larger than 564  amino acids. this putative protein had a consensus zn2+ binding motif, hexxh, found among bacterial thermolysins and mammalian neutral endopeptidases and was 40% identical to a homologous 210-amino-acid region of human enkephalinase. the genetic organization of orfs 1, 2, and 3 was similar to those of the bacterial periplasmic-binding protein-dependent transport systems of gram-negative bacteria and binding-lipoprotein-dependent transport systems of gram-positive bacteria, and these genes appeared to encode abc (atp-binding cassette) proteins. this report describes a cell-to-cell adherence function associated with an atp-binding cassette.

TI  == antigenic relationships among immunoglobulin a1 proteases from haemophilus, neisseria, and streptococcus species.
AB  == to investigate the antigenic variation and relationships of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases among different species and genera, we examined a comprehensive  collection of serine type and metallo-type iga1 proteases and corresponding antisera in enzyme neutralization assays. sharing of neutralizing epitopes of metallo-type iga1 proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis and of serine type iga1 proteases from haemophilus and pathogenic neisseria species was extremely limited. a number of limited to strong cross-reactions in such epitopes were found among serine type iga1 proteases released by members of the genera haemophilus and neisseria,  reflecting the common origin of their iga gene. however, the relatively limited prevalence of shared "neutralizing" epitopes of iga1 proteases from the two genera indicates that they rarely induce immunity to each other. in contrast, extensive sharing of neutralizing epitopes was found between n. meningitidis and  n. gonorrhoeae iga1 proteases, making them potentially attractive vaccine components. among metallo-type iga1 proteases, several pneumococcal proteases were found to induce neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of oral streptococci whereas the opposite was not the case.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

"milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

AB  == gene psaa, which encodes the streptococcus pneumoniae 37-kda protein, was cloned  in escherichia coli, and its complete nucleotide sequence was determined. analysis of the sequence of the 2.4-kb cloned fragment revealed three open reading frames (orfs). orf2, which is 933 bp long, was identified as psaa. the two other orfs identified flank psaa. orf1, located upstream of psaa, is 836 nucleotides long and encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29,843 da. the sequence for orf3, located downstream of psaa, was only partially determined. northern (rna) blot analysis of pneumococcal rna suggests that psaa is transcribed as part of a polycistronic message. analysis of the primary structure of the protein encoded by this gene indicated significant similarity to two previously reported streptococcal proteins, ssab (80% similarity) and fima (92.3% similarity), from s. sanguis and s. parasanguis, respectively. these two homologous proteins have been shown to be associated with bacterial adhesion, and the possibility of a similar role for psaa is hypothesized.

AB  == since serious sequelae may follow streptococcal infections, eradication is viewed as necessary for successful therapy. studies were therefore conducted to compare  the effectiveness of azithromycin with other macrolide antibiotics and amoxycillin to eliminate these organisms in experimental localized infections. in a streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection induced by transtracheal challenge, the pathogen was not recovered after therapy with azithromycin (ed50 7.9 mg/kg), while clarithromycin was not effective (ed50 > 100 mg/kg). however, in a s. pneumoniae middle ear infection, azithromycin and clarithromycin were effective (ed50 2.9 and 6.3 mg/kg, respectively) in eradicating the pathogen from this closed space infection. against a localized streptococcus pyogenes infection (implanted inoculated disc), azithromycin effectively eradicated the pathogen, while clarithromycin, roxithromycin and erythromycin did not. eradication of a viridans streptococcus or streptococcus gordonii (formerly streptococcus sanguis) from heart tissue in experimental bacterial endocarditis was also evaluated. azithromycin given prophylactically or therapeutically was efficacious in eliminating the viridans streptococcus and s. gordonii in the bacterial endocarditis model of infection; erythromycin was only marginally effective in the same studies. all studies provided evidence of the bactericidal action of azithromycin in vivo and demonstrated the ability of the compound to eradicate streptococcal pathogens in localized infections.

AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis twenty-two years after operation risks management and prevention.
AB  == a new case of fatal postsplenectomy sepsis occurring 22 years after operation for splenic rupture is described. there are now 30 published cases in which this complication occurred 10 or more years after operation. the microorganism responsible for the vast majority of cases is streptococcus pneumoniae. the causative pathogen identified in the present case was a viridans streptococcas, strep. sanguis, an opportunistic, low virulence pathogen. the clinical presentation of this patient is characteristic of the syndrome of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection and exemplifies the dramatic suddenness with which it develops.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci have obtained altered penicillin-binding protein genes from penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae possess altered forms of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) with decreased affinity for penicillin. the pbp2b genes of these strains have a mosaic structure, consisting of regions that  are very similar to those in penicillin-sensitive strains, alternating with regions that are highly diverged. penicillin-resistant strains of viridans groups streptococci (e.g., s. sanguis and s. oralis) that produce altered pbps have also been reported. the pbp2b genes of two penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of s. sanguis were identical in sequence to the mosaic class b pbp2b genes found in  penicillin-resistant serotype 23 strains of s. pneumoniae. emergence of penicillin resistance appears to have occurred by the horizontal transfer of an altered pbp2b gene from penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae into s. sanguis. the pbp2b genes of three penicillin-resistant s. oralis strains were similar to the mosaic class b pbp2b gene of penicillin-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae but possessed an additional block of diverged sequence. penicillin resistance in s. oralis has also probably arisen by horizontal transfer of this variant form of the class b mosaic pbp2b gene from a penicillin-resistant strain of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == influenza a virus was found to enhance basophil histamine release induced by escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus sanguis, but did not per se release histamine. this  potentiating effect of the virus was seen both when the bacteria-induced mediator release was ige-dependent (i.e. patient allergic to bacterium) and when the bacterium caused histamine release by a non-immunological mechanism independent of ige (putative sugar-lectin mediated). also histamine release induced by other  immunological and non-immunological stimuli, such as anti-ige, calcium ionophore  or agarose beads was enhanced in the presence of the virus. the potentiating effect of the virus on bacteria-induced mediator release might be of importance for the conversion from latent to manifest asthma in upper respiratory tract infections.

AB  == transformation studies were carried out with a penicillin susceptible (mic 0.006  mg/l) laboratory strain of streptococcus pneumoniae as recipient. donor dna was prepared from two clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae, four isolates of s. mitior  and five isolates of s. sanguis. dna from both isolates of s. pneumoniae generated penicillin-resistant transformants (mics 0.03-2.0 mg/l). in addition, one isolate each of s. mitior and s. sanguis transformed the recipient to increased penicillin resistance, with mics of 0.125 mg/l. dna from the s. sanguis strain generated a transformant which showed a reduction in the penicillin-binding affinity of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2b. dna from a second s. mitior strain generated intermediately resistant (mic 0.5 mg/l) transformants in a single transformation round. the pbp profiles of these transformants showed an apparent molecular size alteration of pbp 2b, corresponding to a pbp found in the donor strain, and pbp 1b was no longer detected. isolates of s. pneumoniae may apparently develop penicillin resistance  either intrinsically, by intragenetic transfer, or by transfer of penicillin resistance determinants from viridans streptococci.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). in order to determine their immune response to s. pyogenes t4, s. pyogenes t12, s mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp, ct, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. blastoid transformation was investigated by [3h] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin g following the addition of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii s. mitis, s. pyogenes t4, and s. pyogenes t12, while those form ct patients and controls did so only with s. pyogenes t4 and s. pyogenes t12. 2. the spontaneous production of specific igg against various streptococci, including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp was already higher than that from ct patients and controls. the specific igm  production was also increased above that in ppp patients without any antigens. 3. s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific igm production in tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients. 4. the levels of specific igg production against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii by tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the ppp patients. these results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially s. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-s. sanguis antibodies in patients with ppp, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of ppp.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == host-vector system for integration of recombinant dna into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
AB  == we describe a genetic system in which transformation of streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant dna into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetm) 6001 (omega 6001). the element containing the recombinant dna was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. when escherichia coli plasmid pdp36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous dna into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous dna caused inactivation of the tetm gene of omega 6001. by analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous dna was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. it was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of s. pneumoniae, s. sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus faecalis. the omega 6001-pdp36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in  streptococci. by this method cloned streptococcal dna (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.

TI  == evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to escherichia coli.
AB  == high-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type b (mls) antibiotics in escherichia coli bm2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative  plasmid pip1527 of the mls resistance determinant ermbc, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pam77 from streptococcus sanguis (ermam) and in transposon tn917 from enterococcus faecalis  (ermb). this gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence is1. the 23s rrna methylase encoded by pip1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by tn917 and pam77, respectively. unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible mls phenotype, the ermbc gene is expressed constitutively in e. coli and bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. transcription of the ermbc gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both e. coli and b. subtilis. promoters p2 and p3 are located within  the region homologous to pam77 and tn917, and p1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of is15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. these results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from streptococcus spp. to e. coli. this transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as tn917 or tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an mls determinant that is homologous to ermb. we speculate that the insertion sequences is15 and is1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermbc, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of a streptococcus sanguis dnase necessary for repair of dna damage induced by uv light and methyl methanesulfonate.
AB  == we developed a method for cloning cellular nucleases from streptococci. recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophage containing streptococcal nuclease determinants were identified by the production of pink plaques on toluidine blue  o dnase plates. we used this technique to clone a 3.2-kilobase-pair ecori fragment with dnase activity from the chromosome of streptococcus sanguis. the locus was designated don (dnase one) and could be subcloned and stably maintained on plasmid vectors in escherichia coli. minicell analyses of various subclones of the don locus allowed us to determine the coding region and size of the don nuclease in e. coli. the don gene product had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kilodaltons and degraded native dna most efficiently, with lesser activity against denatured dna and no detectable activity against rna. s. sanguis don deletion mutants were constructed by transformation of competent cells with in vitro-prepared plasmid constructs. s. sanguis don deletion mutants retained normal transformation frequencies for exogenously added donor dna. however, when  compared with don+ wild-type cells, these mutants were hypersensitive to dna damage induced by uv light and methyl methanesulfonate. an s. sanguis don-specific dna probe detected homology to chromosomal dna isolated from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans bratthall serogroups d and g. our results suggested that the don locus was the s. sanguis allele of the previously described s. pneumoniae major exonuclease and was involved in repair of dna damage. furthermore, hybridization studies suggested that the don locus was conserved among species of oral streptococci.

TI  == transposable multiple antibiotic resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a mobile genetic element, designated tn1545, was detected in the chromosome of streptococcus pneumoniae bm4200, a clinical isolate multiply resistant to antibiotics. the 25.3 kb element conferred resistance to kanamycin and structurally related aminoglycosides by synthesis of a 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type iii (apha-3), to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b-type antibiotics (ermam), and to tetracycline (tetm). tn1545 was self-transferable to a recombination deficient s. faecalis strain where it was able to transpose to various sites, induce insertional mutations and was apparently cleanly excised. the element also conjugated to and transposed to the  chromosome of s. faecalis, s. lactis, s. diacetylactis, s. cremoris, s. sanguis,  staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes. the properties of the conjugative transposon tn1545 could account for the sudden emergence, rapid dissemination, and stabilisation of multiple resistance to antibiotics in s. pneumoniae in the absence of plasmids.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

AB  == staphylococci pretreated with subminimal inhibitory concentrations (submic) of cell-wall active antibiotics exhibit increased susceptibility to killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns), even when phagosome information is impaired  by the mold metabolite, cytochalasin b. to investigate the role of specific bacterial factors in the process, studies were carried out with organisms lacking catalase (streptococci) or cell-wall autolytic enzymes and compared to findings with staphylococcus aureus 502a. neutrophil factors were studied using inhibitors, oxygen radical scavengers, myeloperoxidase (mpo)-deficient pmns, or pmns from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (cgd). documentation of the enhanced susceptibility of the streptococcal strains to killing by pmns following submic penicillin pretreatment required the use of cytochalasin b. enhancement of killing occurred independent of the presence or absence of bacterial autolysins or catalase. submic penicillin pretreatment of s. pneumoniae r36a specifically promoted the susceptibility of these organisms to killing by myeloperoxidase (mpo)-mediated mechanisms (enhancement lost using mpo-deficient or azide-treated cells). factors other than mpo or toxic oxygen products generated by the pmn respiratory burst are responsible for enhanced killing of penicillin-pretreated s. aureus 502a (enhancement preserved using mpo-deficient,  azide-treated, or chronic granulomatous disease patient cells). these studies define methods to study the interaction of antimicrobial agents and pmns in the killing of microorganisms. they also demonstrate that penicillin treatment can change the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci to the action of specific pmn microbicidal mechanisms. the mechanism of the enhancement appears to be bacterial strain-dependent and not predictable by bacterial autolysin or catalase activity.

AB  == the serostat latex agglutination test (scott laboratories, inc., fiskesville, r.i.) for identification of group d streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group d streptococci (s. faecalis, 74; s. bovis, 24; s. durans, 3; s. faecium, 9) and 65  viridans streptococci (s. anginosus-constellatus, 2; streptococcus mg, 15; s. sanguis ii, 14; s. mitis, 7; s. mutans, 5; s. salivarius, 8; s. sanguis i, 8; s.  acidominimus, 1; s. morbillorum, 2; s. pneumoniae, 3). all strains of group d streptococci were bile-esculin positive. serostat reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of s. sanguisii and 1 strain of streptococcus mg (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 s. bovis, 8 s. faecalis, 1 s. durans, and 6 s. faecium strains (22.7% of all group d streptococci tested). when considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, serostat is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group d streptococci.

TI  == quantitative screening of clinical isolates for immunoglobulin a protease production.
AB  == the production of immunoglobulin a (iga) protease is a potentially useful marker  in differentiating pathogenic from nonpathogenic species of clinical isolates; however, current quantitative assay methods are too tedious for routine application. a simple quantitative method was developed to screen clinical isolates for iga protease production. this method is based on the specificity of  reaction between iga and alpha chain-specific antiserum in an immunochemistry analyzer (beckman instruments, inc., brea, calif.). colonies of iga protease producers (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae) were picked from solid media, transferred to brain heart infusion containing iga1, and incubated at 37 degrees c for at least 2 h to provide a detectable decrease in iga concentration. the standard deviation for randomly picked colonies within a species was about +/- 15%. several iga protease-negative species caused no detectable reduction in the iga content of the system. the specificity of the iga measurement eliminates the requirements for extensive purification and radiolabeling of substrate and provides the basis for a well-defined iga protease activity unit (micrograms of iga1 cleaved per minute per milliliter of culture).

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == new method that uses binding of immunoglobulin a to group a streptococcal immunoglobulin a fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin a protease activity.
AB  == a new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin a (iga) protease which splits iga into fab and fc fragments. the method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for iga fragments occur commonly among type 4  group a streptococci. the bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified iga1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. since isolated fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal iga receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. using this method, protease activity was detected in neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus sanguis, but  not in escherichia coli or branhamella catarrhalis.

AB  == iga1 proteases from h. influenzae, n. meningitidis, s. pneumoniae, and s. sanguis were compared with respect to site of cleavage in the iga1 molecule and edta sensitivity. proteases from s. sanguis and s. pneumoniae cleaved the pro (227)-thr (228) bond within the hinge region of the alpha 1 chain and were inhibited by edta. h. influenzae iga1 protease cleaved the pro (231)-ser (232) peptide bond. the activity of iga1 proteases from h. influenzae and n. meningitidis was unaffected by edta. purified and denatured alpha 1 chain was cleaved only in the hinge region. other component chains of secretory iga (secretory component, light and j chains) were not susceptible. in addition to iga1 protease, s. pneumoniae released exo- and endoglycosidases that removed a considerable portion of carbohydrate side chains of iga1; this activity was absent from crude iga1 protease preparations of the other three bacterial species. association in vitro of polymeric iga1 with sc did not inhibit the degradation of iga1 proteases. the considerable resistance of secretory iga to cleavage by iga1 proteases may be explained in part by the presence of iga1 protease-neutralizing antibodies in secretory iga.

AB  == three dnases, designated 1, 2 and 3 have been isolated from lysates of old (incompetent in genetic transformation) and logarithmic phase (competent) streptococcus sanguis strain challis cells. these dnases have different electrophoretic mobilities and immunological properties. influence of some activators and inhibitors on their activity was determined. molecular weights of  3 dnases are in the range of 52,000--57,000. all these enzymes are endonucleases  which degrade native dna; thermally denatured dna is a poor substrate. the enzymes described in this paper differ from the previously known dnases of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. nucleases similar or identical to the challis strain enzymes have been found in two other s. sanguis strains--wicky and blackburn.

TI  == superhelical dna in streptococcus sanguis: role in recombination in vivo.
AB  == competent streptococcus sanguis treated with non-lethal doses of coumermycin a1 immediately before or after uptake of radioactive transforming dna were reduced in their capacity to yield transformants. this treatment did not alter bacterial  ability to bind dna in dnase i-resistant form, nor did it prevent the single-stranded donor dna-recipient protein complexes formed upon uptake at the surface of the bacteria from translocating to chromosomal sites. inhibition of transformation by heterospecific dna was greater than that by homospecific dna. the reduction in transformant yield was not accompanied by any loss of donor counts incorporated into the recipient chromosome, but rather by a loss of genetic activity of incorporated donor material indicating a failure of genetic integration and degradation of donor dna as a consequence of coumermycin treatment. the inhibitory effect of coumermycin on transformation was associated  with in vivo loss of chromosomal dna superhelicity, the chromosomal dna remained  intact, however, indicative of inhibition of a gyrase-like enzyme responsible for the maintenance of negative supercoiling of the s. sanguis chromosome. upon treatment with the drug, a coumermycin-resistant mutant strain showed neither loss of chromosomal superhelicity nor any inhibitory effect on genetic integration of donor dna. the evidence supports the idea that chromosomal superhelicity promotes genetic recombination in vivo.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid sequence common to staphylococcal and streptococcal plasmids which specify erythromycin resistance.
AB  == plasmids from erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus faecalis show deoxyribonucleic acid sequence homology. the homologous sequences can be localized to specific restriction endonuclease fragments, which in the case of s. aureus plasmid pi258 involves a single fragment from either ecori or hindiii digest known to contain the erythromycin resistance determinant. complementary ribonucleic acid probes prepared from s. aureus plasmid pi258 and s. sanguis plasmid pam77 also hybridize to specific fragments in restriction endonuclease digests of deoxyribonucleic acid from erythromycin-resistant streptococcus progenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. these studies suggest a common origin for a class of erythromycin resistance determinants in unrelated strains of pathogenic bacteria for which exchange of genetic material has not been demonstrated.

TI  == enhanced transformability with heterospecific deoxyribonucleic acid upon removal  of nascent ribonucleic acid from the streptococcus sanguis genome.
AB  == treatment of streptococcus sanguis recipient cells with rifampin (rif) at the time of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) addition was an effective means of reducing discrimination, that is, of causing an increase in the number of transformants induced by irreversibly bound heterospecific dna without significantly changing the number induced by bound homospecific dna. rif was unable to reduce discrimination when the recipient cells were rif resistant due to an altered ribonucleic acid (rna) polymerase. when recipient cells were treated at the time  of dna addition with concentrations of streptolydigin (stg) as inhibitory of rna  synthesis as rif, discrimination was not reduced. the kinetics of rna synthesis inhibition with these inhibitors indicated that, as reported for other bacterial  species, rif inhibited the initiation of transcription by rna polymerase, whereas stg inhibited the progression of rna polymerase at any point. pulse-labeling of rna immediately before stg addition showed that, if cells were incubated under stg inhibition for 10 to 15 min, their nascent rna was degraded. genome-bound rna polymerase was not released under these conditions. when recipient cells were incubated with stg until nascent rna was degraded and then exposed to transforming dna, stg was as effective as rif in reducing discrimination. the presence of nascent rna was thereby implicated in the transforming inefficiency of incompletely homologous dna.

TI  == single-stranded regions in streptococcus pneumoniae chromosomal deoxyribonucleic  acid and their relation to transformation.
AB  == deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) in lysates of both completent and noncompetent streptococcus pneumoniae cells was characterized by chromatography on benzoylated, naphthoylated diethylaminoethyl-cellulose columns, by sensitivity to aspergillus oryzae s1 endonuclease, and by sucrose gradient analysis. the dnas from both competent and noncompetent cells were found to contain similar extents  of single-stranded regions. these single-stranded regions appeared to be intact,  unpaired regions in double-stranded dna rather than gaps, nicks, or unpaired ends in the dna. inhibition of cells with rifampin prior to lysis increased the amount of such single strandedness in the dna. lysates made at various times after [14c]thymidine-labeled cells had bound [3h]thymidine-labeled transforming dna were also characterized by benzoylated, naphthoylated diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. changes in the elution profiles of dna from cells exposed to homospecific (s. pneumoniae) donor dna were indicative of the formation of complexes between donor dna and the single-stranded regions of recipient dna. in  contrast, profiles of dna from cells exposed to heterospecific (s. sanguis) dna did not show significant changes, indicating that few such donor-recipient complexes were formed during heterospecific transformation.

TI  == enchancement of streptococcal transformation yield by proteolytic enzymes.
AB  == trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes, added together with transforming dna or during cell-dna contact to competent cultures of several streptococcal strains, enchanced (10 to 600%) the yield of genetic transformation (stimulation). with few exceptions, the level of stimulation was high (over 100%) when competence was low (below 2%). stimulation was caused by the action of an enzyme on competent cells and not on any other component of transformation mixture. the phenomenon occurred when the enzyme was added to the culture not earlier than 7 min before and not later than 5 min after the period of cell-dna contact. the presence of trypsin during cell-dna contact caused: (i) the alterations at cell surface, demonstrated by electron microscopy, increased release of 3h-amino acid-labeled material, and higher cell susceptibility to autolysis; (ii) the increase of both  total and irreversible binding of dna by the cells; and (iii) the decrease of early nucleolytic degradation of dna by cells. these and other data point to the  importance of a delicate balance of recipient cell's surface nuclease activities  in the effectiveness of transformation process. it is also possible that trypsin  eliminates an unknown cellular factor which obstructs dna-cell receptors interaction.

TI  == specific inactivation of heterospecific transforming dna by a factor derived from streptococcus sanguis lysates.
AB  == a heat-sensitive factor obtained from lysates of competent streptococcus sanguis  cells reacts specifically with native dna of heterospecific (s. pneumoniae or calf thymus) origin. in vitro it does not alter the double or single strand length of the dna, nor does it affect uptake of the dna by compentent s. pneumoniae cells in dnase i-resistant form. following uptake, however, dna previously exposed to the factor loses over 90% of its biological activity. reaction of heterospecific dna with the factor is competitive, suggesting a competition for binding to the factor. heating treated dna prior to its reaction  with recipient cells, apparently by irreversibly dissociating the factor, restores to the dna its original potential transforming activity. specific activity of the factor can be increased in cells grown under certain conditions;  this increase is blocked by erythromycin.

AB  == the fate of 3h-labeled str-r fus-s dna from streptococcus pneumoniae, bound after a 1-min uptake to 14c-labeled str-s fus-r s. sanguis recipients, was followed by  techniques previously developed for analyzing the fate of homospecific dna. heterospecific s. pneumoniae dna was bound and formed complexes with recipient protein in a manner similar to that of homospecific dna but transformed relatively poorly. the rate at which complexed heterospecific dna becomes physically associated with recipient dna, and at which donor markers are integrated into the chromosome, was slower than in the case of homospecific dna.  in addition, about half of the heterospecific donor counts initially bound in trichloracetic acid-insoluble form were gradually solubilized and released from the cell. the association of heterospecific dna with the recipient chromosome was more unstable than that involving homospecific dna, since only associations of the former type were largely dissociated by isolation and resedimentation. the donor dna-containing material so dissociated had the same sedimentation properties as complexed heterospecific dna before association, indicating that the complex of single-stranded donor dna and recipient protein formed on uptake moves as a whole from its site of formation to synapse with the chromosome.

TI  == secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  == inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis. lipid  secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. this novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: s. sanguis (group h), s. pyogenes (group a), and s. pneumoniae. the secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. the occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating  with resumption of culture growth. all cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. it  is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.

TI  == tolerant response of streptococcus sanguis to beta-lactams and other cell wall inhibitors.
AB  == in contrast to group a streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae, cells of streptococcus sanguis (group h) do not exhibit the irreversible effects of penicillin treatment, such as loss of viability or lysis. on the other hand, the  same bacteria show typical effects of penicillin, such as morphological alterations, reduction in the rate of cell wall synthesis, and secretion of murein and lipoteichoic acid polymers into the medium. a novel effect of cell wall inhibitors was also noted: treatment with beta-lactams or with fosfomycin, d-cycloserine, or beta-halogeno-d-alanine caused the release of substantial amounts of glycerol lipids into the growth medium. the antibiotic "tolerance" of  s. sanguis is interpreted in terms of the hypothesis that the activity of bacterial murein hydrolases is essential for the irreversible effects of cell wall inhibitors.

TI  == genetic hybridization at the unlinked thy and str loci of streptococcus.
AB  == the sanguis and pneumoniae species of streptococcus were used as recipients in transformations from str+ to str-r and from thy- to thy+. the str-r mutations in  the two species had been previously shown to be allelic. homology of the thy- mutations in the two species was demonstrated in the similar phenotypic properties they conferred (death in the absence of thymidine, lack of thymidylate synthetase). the str and thy loci are unlinked in each species.--- when the two species are transformed by both homospecific and heterospecific dna, the efficiency is always lower in the heterospecific cross. the efficiency of heterospecific transformation is considerably lower at the thy than at the str locus. dna was extracted from recipients that had integrated markers of heterospecific origin. when such hybrid dna is tested on the original recipient species, the heterospecific markers are usually as efficient as homospecific markers. when tested on the original donor species, however, the hybrid dna is usually more efficient than heterospecific dna. this is true for both thy and str transformation. -- -- forty independent thy+ hybrids were obtained in the cross of sanguis thy- recipients with pneumoniae thy+ dna. these hybrids fall into a number of classes based upon the relative efficiency with which their extracted dna's are able to transfer the thy+ marker into pneumoniae thy- cells. the most efficient of these dna's exhibits about 20% of the efficiency of homospecific pneumoniae thy+ dna and three orders of magnitude greater efficiency than heterospecific sanguis thy+ dna. thus, very little of the inefficiency of heterospecific transformation of the thy locus is ascribable to a classic restriction mechanism. rather, the wild-type thy+ loci in the two species appear  to differ at multiple sites, and independent heterospecific transfers result in differential extents of integration of these sites. on this basis, the thy+ loci  of the two species differ at a greater number of sites than do the respective str+ loci.

TI  == a transforming marker that produces merodiploids with high efficiency and stable  transformants with low efficiency in streptococcus.
AB  == a mutation (ery-r8) conferring a high level of resistance to erythromycin in the  challis strain of streptoccus sanguis can be transferred to wild-type erythromycin-sensitive recipients via single molecules of donor dna. the transformants thus produced are of two types: (1) cells slightly more resistant to erythromycin than wild-type and capable of segregating (at a frequency of 2 x  10(-4)/bacterium/generation) either wild-type or highly-resistant cells like the  original donor type; (2) cells phenotypically and genotypically identical to the  original donor type. the unstable diploids (ery-r8/+) occur with a frequency equivalent to that obtained with high-efficiency (he) markers, whereas the stable donor-type (ery-r8) transformants occur with about five hundred times lower frequency. penetration of the wild-type recipient by more than one molecule of dna bearing the ery-r8 marker increases by as much as seven times the incidence of stable transformants. uv-irradiation of molecules bearing the ery-r8 marker diminishes their ability to cooperate in producing a stable transformant, although the uv sensitivity of stable transformant production by a single dna molecule is not different from that of diploid production. hence, stable transformants do not appear to be produced by a process typical of low efficiency (le) markers, which are generally highly sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation. moreover, stable ery-r8 transformants are produced with equally low frequencies in strains of s. pneumoniae that discriminate (hex+) and fail to discriminate (hex--) between he and le markers. we postulate that all transformations by the ery-r8 marker result in ery-r8/+ diploids, and that segregation results in the infrequent stable transformants of the original donor type. this hypothesis is supported by the observations that rifampin treatment of ery-r8/+ populations increases the frequency of segregation and similar treatment of wild-type recipients under-going transformation by the ery-r8 marker increases the frequency of stable transformants.--in producing the ery-r8/+ transformant the r8 allele is integrated close to the site of its wild-type homolog, since single molecules of dna from this transformant can be shown to carry both alleles. segregation of either the ery-r8 or + allele is not detectably enhanced by acridine orange or thymidine deprivation.--the ery-r8 marker occurs close to a site of mutation (ery-r2) which confers erythromycin resistance upon ribosomes. when the r2 and r8 markers are jointly transferred, ery-r2-r8/+ genomes are produced in which the r2 marker is stably integrated but the r8 marker is unstably adjoined to its wild-type homolog. thus, the duplicated region can be quite short. when the ery-r8 marker is stably integrated, the region of the marker is refractory to subsequent transformation. markers with properties like ery-r8 are not particularly rare, being found with a frequency of about 4% among  spontaneous mutations to erythromycin resistance.

TI  == relation of macromolecular synthesis in streptococci to efficiency of transformation by markers of homospecific and heterospecific origin.
AB  == in previous studies with streptococcus sanguis and s. pneumoniae as recipients and donors of transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), it was found that heating recipients just prior to exposure to dna caused an increase in the number of transformants induced by heterospecific dna relative to that induced by homospecific dna. in the present studies, s. sanguis recipients were found to recover from this effect of heat (48 c, 15 min) when incubated at 37 c before exposure to dna. inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis, such as rifampin, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, actinomycin, and p-hydroxyphenylazo-uracil, but not inhibitors of protein synthesis, such as chloramphenicol and erythromycin, prevented recovery from the effect of heat. inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis  caused changes in unheated cells similar to those observed with heat treatment; these changes included increased transformability by genetically hybrid dna and by low-efficiency markers in homospecific dna. the effect of a combination of heat and inhibitors on transformation by heterospecific dna was greater than when single treatments were used. the most effective inhibitor used alone was rifampin: in treated recipient cells, the yield of transformants produced by a given amount of irreversibly bound heterospecific dna was increased without a significant change in the yield of transformants produced by bound homospecific dna. a cell being doubly transformed by homospecific and heterospecific dna was enhanced specifically in its transformability with the latter as a consequence of rifampin treatment. treatment with rifampin also increased co-transformation by linked heterospecific markers. the period during which recipient cells were sensitive to the effects induced by rifampin and fluorodeoxyuridine lasted from 10 to 20 min after dna uptake.
