TI  == in vitro characterization of aggregation and adhesion properties of viable and heat-killed forms of two probiotic lactobacillus strains and interaction with foodborne zoonotic bacteria, especially campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == bacterial aggregation and/or adhesion are key factors for colonization of the digestive ecosystem and the ability of probiotic strains to exclude pathogens. in the present study, two probiotic strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lactobacillus farciminis cncm-i-3699, were evaluated as viable or heat-killed forms and compared with probiotic reference lactobacillus strains (lb. rhamnosus  gg and lb. farciminis cip 103136). the autoaggregation potential of both forms was higher than that of reference strains and twice that of pathogenic strains. the coaggregation potential of these two beneficial micro-organisms was evaluated against several pathogenic agents that threaten the global safety of the feed/food chain: escherichia coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and listeria monocytogenes. the strongest coaggregative interactions were demonstrated with campylobacter spp. by a coaggregation test, confirmed by electron microscopic examination for the two forms. viable forms were investigated for the nature of the bacterial cell-surface molecules involved, by  sugar reversal tests and chemical and enzymic pretreatments. the results suggest  that the coaggregation between both probiotic strains and c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) is mediated by a carbohydrate-lectin interaction. the autoaggregation potential of the two probiotics decreased upon exposure to proteinase, sds or licl, showing that proteinaceous components on the surface of the two lactobacilli play an important role in this interaction. adhesion abilities of both lactobacillus strains were also demonstrated at significant levels on caco-2 cells, mucin and extracellular matrix material. both viable and heat-killed forms of the two probiotic lactobacilli inhibited the attachment of c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) to mucin. in conclusion, in vitro assays showed that lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, as viable or heat-killed forms, are adherent to different intestinal matrix models and are highly aggregative in vitro with pathogens, especially campylobacter spp., the most commonly reported zoonotic agent in the european union. this study supports the need for further in vivo investigations to demonstrate the potential food safety benefits of lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, live or heat-killed, in the global feed/food chain.

TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of halotolerant lactic acid bacteria from  two mexican cheeses.
AB  == isolated strains of halotolerant or halophilic lactic acid bacteria (halab) from  cotija and doble crema cheeses were identified and partially characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods, and their technological abilities were studied  in order to test their potential use as dairy starter components. humidity, a(w), ph, and salt concentration of cheeses were determined. genotypic diversity was evaluated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction. molecular identification and phylogenetic reconstructions based on 16s rrna gene  sequences were performed. additional technological abilities such as salt tolerance, acidifying, and proteolytic and lipolytic activities were also investigated. the differences among strains reflected the biodiversity of halab in both types of cheeses. lactobacillus acidipiscis, tetragenococcus halophilus,  weissella thailandensis, and lactobacillus pentosus from cotija cheese, and l. acidipiscis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus farciminis, and lactobacillus rhamnosus from doble crema cheese were identified based on 16s rrna. quantitative and qualitative assessments showed strains of t.  halophilus and l. plantarum to be proteolytic, along with e. faecium, l. farciminis, and l. pentosus to a lesser extent. lipolytic activity could be demonstrated in strains of e. faecium, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and t. halophilus. strains belonging to the species l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and e. faecium were able to acidify the milk media. this study evidences the presence of halab that may play a role in the ripening of cheeses.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of lactobacillus spp. against brachyspira hyodysenteriae and brachyspira pilosicoli.
AB  == the sensitivity of brachyspira hyodysenteriae and brachyspira pilosicoli, respectively the causative agents of swine dysentery and porcine intestinal spirochaetosis to two probiotic lactobacillus strains, l. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and l. farciminis cncm-i-3699 was studied through viability, motility and coaggregation assays. the cell-free supernatant of these lactobacilli contains lactic acid, that is stressful for brachyspira (leading to the formation of spherical bodies), and lethal. it was demonstrated for the first time the in vitro coaggregation properties of two probiotic lactobacillus strains (active or  heat-treated) with two pathogenic strains of brachyspira, leading to (1) trapping of spirochaetal cells in a physical network as demonstrated by sem; (2) inhibition of the motility of brachyspira. such in vitro studies should encourage in vivo studies in animal model to evaluate the potential of the use of probiotic lactobacilli through a feeding strategy for the prevention of b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
