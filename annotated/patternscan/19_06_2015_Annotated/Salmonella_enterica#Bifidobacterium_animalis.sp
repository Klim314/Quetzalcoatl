TI  == assessing the effects of exposure to environmental stress on some functional properties of bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis.
AB  == this study assessed the effects of exposing a strain of bifidobacterium animalis  ssp. lactis to acid, bile and osmotic stresses on antagonistic properties, biofilm formation and antibiotic susceptibility/resistance profile. exposure to each stress factor appeared to have no significant effect on the antagonism against escherichia coli nctc 12900 and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis pt4. no suppression in biofilm formation due to exposure to stress was observed.  bile and osmotic stresses resulted in significantly higher biofilm formation. expression of an exopolysaccharide synthesis gene, gtf 01207, was significantly higher when the b. animalis ssp. lactis strain was exposed to osmotic stress. susceptibility of the b. animalis ssp. lactis strain to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, ampicillin and vancomycin, and resistance to tetracycline remained  unchanged when exposed to each stress. the expression of a tetracycline resistance gene, tet(w), was significantly higher when exposed to each stress. these results may suggest that the potential for the b. animalis ssp. lactis strain to provide probiotic benefit, after exposure to the stressful conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, remains intact.

TI  == mortality and translocation assay to study the protective capacity of bifidobacterium lactis inl1 against salmonella typhimurium infection in mice.
AB  == the mouse has been largely used for the study of the protective capacity of probiotics against intestinal infections caused by salmonella. in this work we aimed at comparing the mortality and translocation assay for the study of the protective capacity of the human breast milk-derived strain bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis inl1 on a model of gut infection by salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium. different doses of s. typhimurium funed and  b. animalis subsp. lactis inl 1 were administered to balb/c mice in a mortality or a translocation assay. the survival of the control group in the mortality assay resulted to be variable along experiments, and then we preferred to use a translocation assay where the preventive administration of 109 cfu of bifidobacteria/mouse for 10 consecutive days significantly reduced the number of  infected animals and the levels of translocation to liver and spleen, with enhanced secretory immunoglobulin a and interleukin 10 production in the small and large intestine, respectively. ten days of b. animalis subsp. lactis strain inl1 administration to mice significantly reduced both the incidence and the severity of salmonella infection in a mouse model of translocation. this work provided the first evidence that a translocation assay, compared to a mortality assay, could be more useful to study the protective capacity of probiotics against salmonella infection, as more information can be obtained from mice and less suffering is conferred to animals due to the fact that the mortality assay is shorter than the latter. these facts are in line with the guidelines of animal research recently established by the national centre for the replacement, refinement & reduction of animals in research.

TI  == impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  == male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have  reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been  investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized  design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment  at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.

TI  == bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 protects against pathogen-induced nf-kappab activation in vivo.
AB  == background: bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are among the early and important colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract and are generally considered to be part  of a normal, healthy microbiota. it is believed that specific strains within the  microbiota can influence host immune-reactivity and may play a role in protection from infection and aberrant inflammatory activity. one such strain, bifidobacterium animalis ahc7, has been previously shown to protect against salmonella typhimurium infection in mice and helps resolve acute idiopathic diarrhea in dogs. the aim of this study was to investigate the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the bifidobacterium animalis ahc7  protective effect. results: following 4 hours of infection with salmonella typhimurium, nf-kappab activation was significantly elevated in vivo in placebo and enterococcus faecium-fed animals while bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 consumption significantly attenuated the nf-kappab response. in vitro anti-cd3/cd28 stimulated peyer's patch cells secreted significantly less tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma following bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 consumption. stimulated cells released more il-12p70 but this difference did not reach statistical significance. no alteration in mucosal il-6, il-10 or mcp-1 levels were observed. no statistically significant change in the cytokine profile of mesenteric lymph node cells was noted. in vitro, bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 was bound by dendritic cells and induced secretion of both il-10 and il-12p70. in addition, co-culture of cd4+ t cells with bifidobacterium animalis ahc7-stimulated dendritic cells resulted in a significant increase in cd25+foxp3+ t cell numbers. conclusion: bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via the attenuation of pro-inflammatory transcription factor activation in response to an infectious insult associated with modulation  of pro-inflammatory cytokine production within the mucosa. the cellular mechanism underpinning bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 mediated attenuation of nf-kappab activation may include recognition of the bacterium by dendritic cells and induction of cd25+foxp3+ t cells.

TI  == evaluation of in vitro antagonism and of in vivo immune modulation and protection against pathogenic experimental challenge of two probiotic strains of bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the effect of intragastric administration with two strains of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bifido a and bifido b), in gnotobiotic and conventional mice, challenged with salmonella typhimurium. in vitro antagonism test showed that the two strains were able to produce antagonistic substances against various pathogenic microorganisms. in an  ex vivo antagonism test the production of antagonistic substances was observed only against three out ten pathogens tested. both bifidobacterium strains were able to colonize and to maintain high population levels in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice. in addition, the two strains had low and limited translocation  ability and did not cause any histological lesion in any of the organs analyzed.  both strains were able to reduce the fecal number of salmonella in gnotobiotic mice challenged with the pathogen, but only bifido b was able to confer a protection as demonstrated by a lower mortality. higher levels of siga and il-10  were observed only in bifido b mono-associated mice when compared to germ free group. we could conclude that, among the parameters analyzed, the strain bifido b exhibited the more desirable characteristics to be used as a probiotic.

TI  == genetically engineered bifidobacterium animalis expressing the salmonella flagellin gene for the mucosal immunization in a mouse model.
AB  == background: a critical component of the host defense against enteric infections is the immunological response of the mucosal membrane, a major starting point of  infectious disease, such as typhoid fever. the mucosal immune system consists of  an integrated network of lymphoid tissues, mucous membrane-associated cells, and  effector molecules. in the present study, we developed a recombinant bifidobacterium animalis (b. animalis) genetically modified with the salmonella flagellin gene for mucosal immunization as an oral typhoid vaccine. methods: we constructed an oral vaccine against salmonella typhimurium, consisting of recombinant b. animalis containing the flagellin gene of salmonella. the recombinant b. animalis was administered orally to mice every other day for 6 weeks. anti-flagellin antibodies in the serum and stools were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: we detected significantly higher levels of flagellin-specific iga in the serum and stools of the mice treated with the recombinant b. animalis containing the flagellin gene than was seen in those treated with parental b. animalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that an oral vaccination using recombinant b. animalis genetically modified with the flagellin gene of salmonella may be effective against salmonella infections.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  == a defined bacterial culture protective against salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (cf) culture apparatus. chicks receiving the cf culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by s. typhimurium. the culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. the isolates were identified as enterococcus avium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis (designated a and b), lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus animalis, a lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain cms), citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, e. fergusonii, bifidobacterium animals, and propionibacterium acidipropionici. results indicated that cf cultures can be  used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to s. typhimurium in the chick cecum.
