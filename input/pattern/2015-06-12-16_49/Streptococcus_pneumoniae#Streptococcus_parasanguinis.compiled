TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - Molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR)  of the parC gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  - Forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (VGS) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In addition, the parC gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. Overall, 44 VGS organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. Reduced MICs were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. Overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the MIC in the case of Streptococcus mitis, S. oralis and S. salivarius, as well as to increase the MIC by two doubling dilutions in two of the three S. parasanguinis isolates. Amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the parC gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. Eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with S. pneumoniae R6 and eight (S52, F55, S58, N91, E135, K137, F141 and S167) were common in the VGS species examined. In addition, minor substitutions were found at three positions (D51, T54 and V86). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of VGS isolated from the community. In addition, several silent mutations were noted in VGS organisms without any increase in MIC against ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an active N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase enzyme complex from Streptococci.
AB  - A new family of bacterial serine-rich repeat glycoproteins can function as adhesins required for biofilm formation and pathogenesis in streptococci and staphylococci. Biogenesis of these proteins depends on a gene cluster coding for glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion proteins. Previous studies show that Fap1, a member of this family from Streptococcus parasanguinis, can be glycosylated by a protein glycosylation complex in a recombinant heterogeneous host. Here we report a tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach used to isolate and study protein complexes from native streptococci. This method demonstrated that a putative glycosyltransferase (Gtf2), which is essential for Fap1 glycosylation, readily copurified with another glycosyltransferase (Gtf1) from native S. parasanguinis. This result and the similar isolation of a homologous two-protein complex from Streptococcus pneumoniae indicate the biological relevance of the complexes to the glycosylation in streptococci. Furthermore, novel N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity was discovered for the complexes. Optimal activity required heterodimer formation and appears to represent a novel type of glycosylation.
TI  - Molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(B) and mef(A)] in Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within CF airways has not yet been examined. We therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. METHODS: Erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (VGS) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and VGS [n = 84; i.e. Streptococcus salivarius (n = 30), Streptococcus mitis (n = 17), Streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), Streptococcus oralis (n = 10), Streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), Streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), Streptococcus infantis (n = 3), Streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), Streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and Streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult CF patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for at least the previous 7 months. RESULTS: Almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. The majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(B) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(A) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(E) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(B) and mef(E) genes simultaneously in 11/99 (11.1%). These results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in VGS in adult CF patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with azithromycin in CF patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal VGS, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.
TI  - The utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  - There is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in Gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. In this study, we utilized an E. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pVT1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pVPT-CTag and pVPT-NTag, with each set containing five affinity tags (GST, GFP, HSV, T7 and Nano) that can be fused to either the C- or N-terminus of a target protein. A putative glycosyltransferase (Gtf2) essential for Fap1 glycosylation was used to demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of Gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain Streptococcus parasanguinis. GFP and T7 tags were readily expressed in S. parasanguinis as either an N- or C-terminal fusion to Gtf2. Only the C- terminal fusion of GST and HSV were able to be identified in S. parasanguinis. The Nano tag was not detected in either E. coli or S. parasanguinis. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged Gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the Gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the Nano-tagged Gtf2 at its N-terminal fusion. Using a T7-tagged Gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including S. mutans, S. pneumoniae and S. sanguinis. Therefore, the expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in Fap1 biogenesis in S. parasanguinis, but also to study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pVT1666 replicates.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - Application and evaluation of the interlaboratory reproducibility of tRNA intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tDNA-PCR) for identification of Streptococcus species.
AB  - The discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of tRNA intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tDNA-PCR) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. This method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. It was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tDNA fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. In a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. All Streptococcus species studied, except S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tDNA fingerprints. A database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
