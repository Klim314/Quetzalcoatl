TI  == characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  == propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in  the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates  of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was  a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
