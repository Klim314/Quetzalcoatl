TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == bacterial flora of the uterus of cows after calving on two hygienically contrasting farms.
AB  == intrauterine swabs were obtained from cows after calving on two commercial dairy  herds with contrasting hygienic environments and incidence of leucorrhea, and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. of 26 cows with a normal calving and puerperium, eight of 14 (57 per cent) were sterile on farm b where hygiene was poor, compared with five of 12 (42 per cent) on farm a where hygiene was better.  two cows on farm b retained their placentas and subsequently developed metritis/endometritis. actinomyces pyogenes was the commonest bacterial isolate and fusobacterium nucleatum, proteus mirabilis and bacteroides melaninogenicus were also frequently observed. similar isolates were obtained from cows on farm b with parturient or puerperal disorders. the contrasting hygienic environments had no influence on either the quantitative or qualitative uterine bacterial flora. thus, the difference in the incidence of endometritis must have been due to factors other than hygiene.

TI  == absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  == the absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, rh. viridis, rhodospirillum tenue, chromobacterium violaceum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bordetella pertussis, vibrio metchnikovii, vibrio cholerae, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica and fusobacterium nucleatum. the 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid l-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. with the aid of authentic d-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-o-substitution or  type of linkage, possess the d-configuration. 2-hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is  present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the l-configuration.
