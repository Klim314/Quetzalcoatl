TI  == antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  == guedes-pinto paste is the filling material most employed in brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the rifocort(r) ointment has been removed. thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace rifocort(r) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: nebacetin(r) ointment, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel, and maxitrol(r) ointment.  a paste composed of iodoform, rifocort(r) ointment and camphorated paramonochlorophenol (cpc) was employed as the gold standard (g1). the other associations were: iodoform, nebacetin(r) ointment and cpc (g2); iodoform, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate gel and cpc (g3); iodoform, maxitrol(r) ointment and cpc (g4). the associations were tested for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), enterococcus  faecalis (e. faecalis), escherichia coli (e. coli), and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. the results were tested using statistical analysis anova and kruskal-wallis. they showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with g1. s. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of tukey), insofar as g2 and g3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. all associations were bactericidal for e. coli, s. aureus, s. mutans and s. oralis. only g3 and g4 were bactericidal for e. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for b. subtilis. thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.

TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == pilus hijacking by a bacterial coaggregation factor critical for oral biofilm development.
AB  == the formation of dental plaque, a highly complex biofilm that causes gingivitis and periodontitis, requires specific adherence among many oral microbes, including the coaggregation of actinomyces oris with streptococcus oralis that helps to seed biofilm development. here, we report the discovery of a key coaggregation factor for this process. this protein, which we named coaggregation factor a (cafa), is one of 14 cell surface proteins with the lpxtg motif predicted in a. oris mg1, whose function was hitherto unknown. by systematic mutagenesis of each of these genes and phenotypic characterization, we found that the actinomyces/streptococcus coaggregation is only abolished by deletion of cafa. subsequent biochemical and cytological experiments revealed that cafa constitutes the tip of a unique form of the type 2 fimbria long known for its role in coaggregation. the direct and predominant role of cafa in adherence is evident from the fact that cafa or an antibody against cafa inhibits coaggregation, whereas the shaft protein fima or a polyclonal antibody against fima has no effect. remarkably, fima polymerization was blocked by deletion of genes for both cafa and fimb, the previously described tip protein of the type 2  fimbria. together, these results indicate that some surface proteins not linked to a pilus gene cluster in gram-positive bacteria may hijack the pilus. these unique tip proteins displayed on a common pilus shaft may serve distinct physiological functions. furthermore, the pilus shaft assembly in gram-positive bacteria may require a tip, as is true for certain gram-negative bacterial pili.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == heterologous hyper-expression of a glucansucrase-type glycosyltransferase gene.
AB  == heterologous expression of the large glucansucrase-type glycosyltransferases genes is still a challenge, and typically yields are poor. therefore, a number of different escherichia coli systems for the expression of such a gene, encoding the glycosyltransferase r (gtfr) from streptococcus oralis, were constructed and  evaluated. we thereby obtained a strain producing the highest molar yields described so far for this class of enzymes. cloning of a 5'-terminally truncated  version of the gene in the expression vector pet33b(+) yielded, in dissolved form, about 2 micromol (300 mg) of enzyme per liter of culture of an optical density at 600 nm of four. problems frequently encountered in the heterologous biosynthesis of this class of enzymes, such as formation of a high fraction of insoluble aggregates and/or proteolytic degradation, were not observed in the described system. the over-produced enzyme, devoid of almost its entire variable  region, retained its characteristic activities.

TI  == screening of amazonian plants from the adolpho ducke forest reserve, manaus, state of amazonas, brazil, for antimicrobial activity.
AB  == tropical forests are species-rich reserves for the discovery and development of antimicrobial drugs. the aim of this work is to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial potential of amazon plants found within the national institute on amazon research's adolpho ducke forest reserve, located in manaus, state of amazonas, brazil. 75 methanol, chloroform and water extracts representing 12 plant species were tested for antimicrobial activity towards strains of mycobacterium smegmatis, escherichia coli, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans using the gel-diffusion method. active extracts were further evaluated to establish minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and antimicrobial profiles using bioautography on normal-phase thin-layer chromatography plates. diclinanona calycina presented extracts with good antimicrobial activity and s. oralis and m. smegmatis were the most sensitive bacteria. d. calycina and lacmellea gracilis presented extracts with the lowest mic (48.8 microg/ml). d. calycina methanol and chloroform leaf extracts presented the best overall antimicrobial activity. all test organisms were sensitive to d. calycina branch chloroform extract in the bioautography assay. this is the first evaluation of the biological activity of these plant species and significant in vitro antimicrobial activity was detected in extracts  and components from two species, d. calycina and l. gracilis.

TI  == antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  == objective: compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. study design: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecalis; escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis sample were used. the storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (gprt). refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees c for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (gpr). to perform the immediate effect analysis (gpi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although gpr, iodoform, rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees c average temperature. the testing methodology was dilution in solid medium-agar. the wilcoxon test and friedman variance analyses were used. results: the gp paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. conclusion: the pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.

TI  == bacteria trigger oxygen radical release and sperm lipid peroxidation in in vitro  model of semen inflammation.
AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus oralis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (roi) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (wbc) with spermatozoa. design: an in vitro model of semen infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main outcome measure(s): chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate roi generation by wbc. malondialdehyde (mda) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. result(s): of the bacterial strains tested, b. ureolyticus, s. haemolyticus, and  e. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. an increase in mda levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced roi generation. the wbc usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. conclusion(s): the harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. the presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be  the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may  affect the fertility status.

TI  == characterisation of viridans group streptococci with different levels of tet(m)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == cohesive interactions between porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role  in the colonization of p. gingivalis in periodontal sites. although p. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with s. oralis, the s. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. we identified the coadhesin of  s. oralis atcc 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. we found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kda. dot blot and western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kda protein to p. gingivalis fimbriae. further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). next, we cloned the gene that encodes s. oralis gapdh and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of gapdhs of various bacteria, including streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum. to confirm the contribution of s. oralis gapdh to the interaction with p. gingivalis, a recombinant gapdh protein was generated in escherichia coli; this protein bound to p. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. these results suggest that s. oralis gapdh functions as a coadhesin for p. gingivalis fimbriae. in addition, considering the high degree of homology of the gapdhs of various bacteria, those  of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of p. gingivalis.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == quantitative evaluation of bacteria adherent to polyelectrolyte hema-based hydrogels.
AB  == the use of adhesive poly(hema)-based hydrogels is standard practice in dental restorative procedures. microorganisms, which potentially can cause oral pathologies, may colonize these polymers. in the present work, bacterial adhesion to polymers prepared with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (hema) and to different molar ratios of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane-sulfonic acid (amps) and/or to 2-methacryloyloxyethyl-tri-methyl-ammonium chloride (metac) co-monomers were tested. a colorimetric assay system that utilizes the microbo revelation medium (microbo srl, rome, italy) for microbial counts is shown to be capable of counting the number of adherent bacterial cells without removing them from polymer surfaces. in conditions that mimic those present in the oral cavity, similar bacterial adhesion percentages on the same polymer were observed with the different bacteria belonging to both gram-positive and gram-negative genera, such as streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus oralis (resident microorganisms in the oral cavity) and staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (transient microorganisms in the oral cavity). it is determined that the physico-chemical characteristics of poly(hema)-based hydrogels are the major  factors promoting bacterial adhesion, which increased with increasing water content in the swollen polymers, reaching maximal values on the cationic polymers.

TI  == expression of green fluorescent protein in streptococcus gordonii dl1 and its use as a species-specific marker in coadhesion with streptococcus oralis 34 in saliva-conditioned biofilms in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is one of the predominant streptococci in the biofilm ecology of the oral cavity. it interacts with other bacteria through receptor-adhesin complexes formed between cognate molecules on the surfaces of the partner cells. to study the spatial organization of s. gordonii dl1 in oral biofilms, we used green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a species-specific marker to identify s. gordonii in a two-species in vitro oral biofilm flowcell system. to drive expression of gfp, we isolated and characterized an endogenous s. gordonii  promoter, phppa, which is situated upstream of the chromosomal hppa gene encoding an oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein. a chromosomal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene fusion with phppa was constructed and used to demonstrate that phppa was highly active throughout the growth of bacteria in batch culture. a promoterless 0.8-kb gfp ('gfp) cassette was pcr amplified from pbj169 and subcloned to replace the cat cassette downstream of the s. gordonii-derived phppa in pmh109-hpp, generating pma1. subsequently, the phppa-'gfp cassette was pcr amplified from pma1 and subcloned into pdl277 and pva838 to generate the escherichia coli-s. gordonii shuttle vectors pma2 and pma3, respectively. each vector was transformed into s. gordonii dl1 aerobically  to ensure gfp expression. flow cytometric analyses of aerobically grown transformant cultures were performed over a 24-h period, and results showed that  gfp could be successfully expressed in s. gordonii dl1 from phppa and that s. gordonii dl1 transformed with the phppa-'gfp fusion plasmid stably maintained the fluorescent phenotype. fluorescent s. gordonii dl1 transformants were used to elucidate the spatial arrangement of s. gordonii dl1 alone in biofilms or with the coadhesion partner streptococcus oralis 34 in two-species biofilms in a saliva-conditioned in vitro flowcell system. these results show for the first time that gfp expression in oral streptococci can be used as a species-specific marker in model oral biofilms.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbrial structural subunit gene, fima, and the 3' flanking dna region was determined. the fima gene encoded a 535-amino-acid precursor subunit protein (fima) which included both n-terminal leader and c-terminal cell wall sorting sequences. a second gene, designated orf365, that encoded a 365-amino-acid protein which contained a putative transmembrane segment was identified immediately 3' to fima. mutants in which either fima or orf365 was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene did not participate in type 2 fimbriae-mediated coaggregation with streptococcus oralis 34. type 2 fimbrial antigen was not detected in cell extracts of the fima mutant by western blotting with anti-a. naeslundii type 2 fimbrial antibody, but the subunit protein was detected in extracts of the orf365 mutant. the subunit protein detected in this mutant also was immunostained by an  antibody raised against a synthetic peptide representing the c-terminal 20 amino  acid residues of the predicted fima. the antipeptide antibody reacted with fima isolated from the recombinant escherichia coli clone containing fima but did not  react with purified type 2 fimbriae in extracts of the wild-type strain. these results indicate that synthesis of type 2 fimbriae in a. naeslundii t14v may involve posttranslational cleavage of both the n-terminal and c-terminal peptides of the precursor subunit and also the expression of orf365.

TI  == molecular bases of three characteristic phenotypes of pneumococcus: optochin-sensitivity, coumarin-sensitivity, and quinolone-resistance.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is uniquely sensitive to amino alcohol antimalarials in  the erythro configuration, such as optochin, quinine, and quinidine. the protein  responsible for the optochin (quinine)-sensitive (opts, qins) phenotype of pneumococcus is the proteolipid c subunit of the fzerof1 h(+)-atpase. optr/qinr isolates arose by point mutations in the atpc gene and produce different amino acid changes in one of the two transmembrane alpha-helices of the c subunit. in addition, comparison of the sequence of the atpcab genes of s. pneumoniae r6 (opts) and m222 (an optr strain produced by interspecies recombination between pneumococcus and s. oralis), and s. oralis (optr) revealed that, in m222, an interchange of atpc and atpa had occurred. we also demonstrate that optochin, quinine, and related compounds specifically inhibited the membrane-bound atpase activity. equivalent differences between opts/qins and optr/qinr strains, both in growth inhibition and in membrane atpase resistance, were found. pneumococci also show a characteristic sensitivity to coumarin drugs, and a relatively high level  of resistance to most quinolones. we have cloned and sequenced the gyrb gene, and characterized novobiocin resistant mutants. the same amino acid substitution (ser-127 to leu) confers novobiocin resistance on four isolates. this residue position is equivalent to val-120 of escherichia coli rygb, a residue that lies inside the atp-binding domain but is not involved in novobiocin binding in e. coli, as revealed by crystallographic data. in addition, the genes encoding the parc and pare subunits of topoisomerase iv, together with the region encoding amino acids 46 to 172 (residue numbers as in e. coli) of the pneumococcal ryga subunit, were characterized in respect to fluoroquinolone resistance. the gyra gene maps to a physical location distant from the gyrb and parec loci on the chromosome. ciprofloxacin-resistant (cpr) clinical isolates had mutations affecting amino acid residues of the quinolone resistance-determining region of parc (low-level cpr), or in both resistance-determining regions of parc and gyra  (high-level cpr). mutations were found in residue positions equivalent to ser-83  and asp-87 of the e. coli gyra subunit. transformation experiments demonstrated that topoisomerase iv is the primary target of ciprofloxacin, dna gyrase being a  secondary one.

TI  == homeologous recombination and mismatch repair during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: saturation of the hex mismatch repair system.
AB  == the ability of the hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous) sequences during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated. by using as donor in transformation cloned fragments 1.7-17.5% divergent in dna sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other fragments. in the latter case, the hex system becomes saturated (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome. further investigation with chromosomal donor dna, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can lead to saturation of the hex system. increase in cellular concentration of either hexa, the muts homologue that binds mismatches, or hexb, the mutl homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating conditions. investigation of heterospecific transformation  by chromosomal dna from two related streptococcal species, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the hex system. therefore the hex system is not a barrier to interspecies recombination in s. pneumoniae. these results are discussed in light of those described for the mut system of escherichia coli.

TI  == use of restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of rrna genes to assign species to unknown clinical isolates of oral viridans streptococci.
AB  == this study evaluated restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotyping) for genotypic identification of 53 oral isolates classified as "streptococcus sanguis" by colony morphology. isolates were from 8-h buccal plaque on lower first permanent molars of 20 subjects. dna was digested with aatii and hybridized with digoxygenin-labeled cdna of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. strains were ribotyped again with alwni or pvuii on the basis of the presence or absence of a 2,290-bp aatii band. band patterns were compared with reference ribotypes for streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus parasanguis strains. forty-eight isolates could be assigned to a species (22 s. sanguis, 14 s. oralis, 12 s. gordonii). multiple species were seen in 14 subjects; multiple strains of the same species occurred in 11 subjects. our findings suggest that ribotyping can be used for genotypic identification of s. sanguis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii isolates.

TI  == species identification of oral viridans streptococci by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of rrna genes.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis have been divided  into six genetic groups. methods to identify those species by genotype are needed. this study compared restriction fragment polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotypes) for seven s. gordonii, three s. sanguis, four s. oralis, three s. mitis, one s. crista, and seven s. parasanguis strains classified in previous dna hybridization studies, as well as one clinical isolate. dna was digested with hindiii, pvuii, hindiii and pvuii combined, ecori, bamhi, aatii, alwni, and draii. dna fragments were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. parasanguis all showed an isolated 2,290-bp band in aatii ribotypes that was absent from s. gordonii, s. sanguis, and s. crista. the  last three groups showed species-specific bands with aatii and also with pvuii. s. oralis could be distinguished from s. mitis and s. parasanguis in alwni and draii ribotypes. s. mitis and s. parasanguis could not be distinguished, since they shared multiple bands in pvuii, alwni, and ecori patterns. the clinical isolate in the panel was very similar to s. sanguis by all enzymes used. our findings suggest that ribotyping may be useful for genotypic identification of oral viridans streptococci. initial digests of clinical isolates might be made with aatii, followed by pvuii or alwni. isolates then could be identified by comparing ribotype patterns with those of reference strains. this approach could  facilitate clinical studies of these newly defined species.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the bacillus subtilis hemehy gene cluster, which  encodes protoheme ix biosynthetic enzymes.
AB  == mutations that cause a block in a late step of the protoheme ix biosynthetic pathway, i.e., in a step after uroporphyrinogen iii, map at 94 degrees on the bacillus subtilis chromosomal genetic map. we have cloned and sequenced the hem genes at this location. the sequenced region contains six open reading frames: pona, heme, hemh, hemy, orfa, and orfb. the pona gene product shows over 30% sequence identity to penicillin-binding proteins 1a of escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis and probably has a role in cell wall metabolism. the heme gene was identified from amino acid sequence comparisons as encoding uroporphyrinogen iii decarboxylase. the hemh gene was identified by enzyme activity analysis of the hemh protein expressed in e. coli.  it encodes a water-soluble ferrochelatase which catalyzes the final step in protoheme ix synthesis, the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin ix. the function of the hemy gene product was not elucidated, but mutation analysis shows that it is required for a late step in protoheme ix synthesis. the hemy gene probably encodes an enzyme with coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase or protoporphyrinogen ix oxidase activity or both of these activities. inactivation  of the orfa and orfb genes did not block protoheme ix synthesis. preliminary evidence for a hemehy mrna was obtained, and a promoter region located in front of heme was identified. from these combined results we conclude that the hemehy gene cluster encodes enzymes for the synthesis of protoheme ix from uroporphyrinogen iii and probably constitutes an operon.

TI  == the gene encoding a prevotella loescheii lectin-like adhesin contains an interrupted sequence which causes a frameshift.
AB  == we cloned and sequenced the prevotella loescheii gene plaa, which encodes a lectin-like adhesin that mediates the coaggregation of p. loescheii 1295 with streptococcus oralis 34. a probe derived from the n-terminal amino acid sequence  of the purified adhesin was used to identify the plaa gene from a p. loescheii genomic library constructed in lambda gem-11. sequence analysis of plaa indicates that the initial translation product contains a 22-amino-acid leader. the reading frame of the plaa gene is interrupted after amino acid 28 of the mature protein by a taa termination codon. amplification of the p. loescheii genomic dna in the  region surrounding this codon by the polymerase chain reaction followed by dna sequencing of the cloned dna fragment established that this stop codon was not an experimental artifact. a frameshift beginning 29 bp downstream of the ochre terminator was required to access the only large open reading frame in the gene.  amino acid sequences of six purified peptides derived by limited proteolysis of adhesin with endoproteinase lys-c matched the downstream amino acid sequence derived by translation of the large open reading frame. the gene coding sequence  of 2.4 kb contains sufficient information for the synthesis of an 89-kda protein. a putative rho-independent terminator (delta g = -25.5 kcal/mol [ca. -107 kj/mol]) was detected 38 bp downstream from the plaa stop codon.

TI  == nucleotide sequences of genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus oralis with high homology to escherichia coli penicillin-binding proteins 1a and 1b.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 3,378-bp dna fragment of streptococcus pneumoniae that included the structural gene for penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 1a (pona), which encodes 719 amino acids, was determined. homologous dna fragments from an s. oralis strain were amplified with pona-specific oligonucleotides. the 2,524-bp s. oralis sequence contained the coding region for the first 636 amino acids of a pbp. the coding sequence differed by 437 nucleotides (27%) and one additional triplet, resulting in 87 amino acid substitutions (14%), from s. pneumoniae pbp 1a. both pbps are highly homologous to bifunctional high-m(r) escherichia coli pbps 1a and 1b.

TI  == [bacteriology of abdominal pus in 43 cases of acute appendicitis and appendiceal  abscess at the ivrea-castellamonte hospital, isolation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and drug sensitivity].
AB  == a retrospective study on the microbiology of abdominal pus from acute appendicitis or peritonitis was carried out by the authors. a total of 45 specimens were examined, 38 of them (84.4%) where found to be positive, of which  29 (76.3%) were polymicrobial and 9 (23.7%) were monomicrobial. the most represented species were escherichia coli (28.4%), bacteroides fragilis (7.8%), streptococcus milleri (7.8%), bacteroides oralis (3.9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.9%). the polymicrobial associations more represented include bacteroidaceae, enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus genus. the most active drugs in vitro were found to be piperacillin and chloramphenicol, cephalosporin (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and cefoxitin) showed a good capability of being active  against isolated microorganisms although they were less effective when used against anaerobic microorganisms then aerobic ones. on the contrary, rifampicin,  metronidazole and clindamycin were found to be quite effective against the anaerobes.

TI  == characterization of genetic transformation in streptococcus oralis nctc 11427: expression of the pneumococcal amidase in s. oralis using a new shuttle vector.
AB  == we have worked out conditions for the study of competence development and genetic transformation in streptococcus oralis nctc 11427 (type strain), a species that contains choline in the cell wall. the peak of competence was found at the early  exponential phase of growth and the optimal conditions for transformation were achieved with shuttle plasmids prepared from s. pneumoniae or from escherichia coli serving as donor dna. transformation with dye-buoyant density gradient purified plasmid preparations followed first-order kinetics. the pneumococcal amidase can be expressed in s. oralis harbouring a plasmid carrying the lyta gene. this enzyme lysed the cell wall of the transformed cell in the presence of  detergents.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

(forsyth dental center and harvard school of dental medicine, boston, mass.), s. s. socransky, and b. kapsimalis. establishment of human indigenous bacteria in germ-free mice. j. bacteriol. 88:1316-1323. 1964.-thirteen strains of bacteria indigenous to the gingival crevice area of man were tested for their ability to establish as monocontaminants in germ-free mice. three facultative organisms, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus albus, and a "diphtheroid," established, as well as three anaerobes. fusobacterium fusiforme,  an anaerobic diphtheroid, and a bacteroides strain. seven other anaerobes (two strains of b. melaninogenicus, and one strain each of treponema microdentium, veillonella alcalescens, a peptostreptococcus strain, vibrio sputorum, and b. oralis) failed to establish. a mixture consisting of ten organisms representative of the predominant groups of cultivable bacteria present in the gingival crevice  area of man was inoculated intraorally into germ-free mice. all organisms with the exception of b. melaninogenicus and t. microdentium became established as polycontaminants. escherichia coli could be established in the above polycontaminated mice, as well as in those contaminated directly with human gingival debris. e. coli comprised approximately 50 and 6% of the fecal flora in  the two groups, respectively. diet, cecal contents, and feces of germ-free and polycontaminated mice were tested for inhibitory action against t. microdentium and b. melaninogenicus. none inhibited t. microdentium, whereas all three inhibited b. melaninogenicus. the inhibitory effect appeared to be due to dietary alfalfa. b. melaninogenicus could become established in mice monocontaminated with a facultative diptheroid and maintained on an alfalfa-free diet. these experiments indicate that human indigenous bacteria can become established in germ-free mice, and that microbial interactions and diet composition are important determinants.
