TI  == [the effectiveness of glass bead sterilizer in the dental practice].
AB  == objectives: although it is not fda-approved as inter-patients sterilization measure, in israel, glass bead sterilizer is still a common method for chair-side sterilization of small dental hand instruments, especially endodontic files. studies from the 1950-1970s achieved sterilization by the bead sterilizer within  few seconds. nevertheless, there are no current evidence-based instructions for using this sterilizer. the study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in sterilization of endodontic files, according to current microbiologic knowledge. methods: standard endodontic k-files (#15, 50, 80) were  sterilized in a steam autoclave and then soaked in actinomyces israelii, eikenella corrodens or bacillus cereus [0.5 macfarland] media for 10 sec. after drying, the files were placed in 225 degrees c or 250 degrees c-heated glass bead sterilizers for 0, 15, 30 or 60 sec. after appropriate incubation for 10 d, morphologic and biochemical examinations were performed to reveal bacterial growth. results: files that have been contaminated with a. israelii were sterilized within 30 sec, whereas b. cereus and e. corrodens-contaminated files needed 60 sec for sterilization. conclusions: the use in bead sterilizer has to be limited only for sterilization of intra-appointment purpose. however, it seems that the common method of using bead sterilizer for sterilization time of few seconds is not effective. in order to eliminate spore-forming bacteria, like b. cereus, by bead sterilizer, the sterilization time has to be at least 60 sec. more research is needed, however, for establishing the effectiveness of the bead  sterilizer for viral infection control and for other dental instruments.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime tested against infrequently isolated pathogenic species (unusual pathogens).
AB  == the cefotaxime sodium spectrum of activity is very broad and includes many common species and a variety of less frequently isolated pathogens. we have reviewed the clinical microbiology literature (44 references) and the data base of the university of iowa hospitals and clinics (iowa city, ia) to collect data on the activity of cefotaxime against the less common species. cefotaxime was consistently active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga  spp., eikenella corrodens, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, pasteurella multocida, plesiomonas shigelloides, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the species alcaligenes xylosoxidans, flavobacterium spp., stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and rhodococcus equi were uniformly cefotaxime resistant. for many other species there was considerable variation in  reported minimum inhibitory concentrations. these data may be helpful in guiding  therapy of unusual infections, particularly in the case of fastidious species, where the appropriate susceptibility testing methodology may not be immediately or routinely available.
