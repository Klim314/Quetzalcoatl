TI  == acute-phase responses in cattle infected with hydatid cysts and microbial agents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydatid cysts and microbial agents on the acute-phase response in cattle. twenty-seven cattle with  hydatid cysts and eight apparently healthy cattle comprised the study and control groups, respectively. parasitological, microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the liver and lungs were undertaken, and 49 of these organs were infected with cysts. in 14 of 31 (45.1%) livers and 10 of 18 (55.5%) lungs microbial growth was observed. the most frequent species occurring  in the liver were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter spp., whereas in the lungs the most common species was candida  spp., followed by streptococcus spp., mannheimia haemolytica, corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp. and s. aureus. the concentration of serum interleukin (il-6) in infected cattle, 455.35 +/- 39.68 pg/ml, was significantly higher than  that of 83.02 +/- 17.87 pg/ml in the control group (p0.05). the highest concentrations of il-6 were detected in serum of the cattle where microbial growth had been detected, followed by cattle infected with bacteria + trichostrongylus sp. (p< 0.001). consequently, saa showed an important increase in the group infected with hydatid cysts, whereas haptoglobin level decreased. it was noticed that il-6, like saa, had a significant role in hydatid cyst infection. therefore il-6 and saa appear to be major markers in the detection of  infection of cattle with hydatid cysts.

TI  == emerging issues in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from food-producing animals.
AB  == during the last decade, antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food-producing  animals has become a major research topic. in this review, different emerging resistance properties related to bacteria of food-producing animals are highlighted. these include: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae; carbapenemase-producing bacteria; bovine respiratory tract pathogens, such as pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica, which harbor the multiresistance mediating integrative and conjugative element icepmu1; gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that carry the multiresistance gene cfr; and the occurrence of numerous novel antimicrobial resistance genes in livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the emergence of the aforementioned resistance properties is mainly based on the exchange of mobile genetic elements that carry the respective resistance genes.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == the role of mannheimia species in ovine mastitis.
AB  == mannheimia haemolytica is known to be an important cause of intramammary infection in sheep. it usually causes severe clinical mastitis, followed by toxaemia and gangrenous necrosis of the udder. however there are limited data available on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of mastitis associated with mannheimia species. these organisms can be more significant as a cause of mastitis than staphylococcus aureus in some flocks. some data suggest the possibility of horizontal transmission of mannheimia species between ewes via lamb sucking. there is no vaccine available for prevention, and the sudden onset  of mastitis and its peracute nature renders most treatments unsuccessful. this review examines the significance of the species within this genus in sheep mastitis.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic integration of orbifloxacin  in korean hanwoo cattle.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orbifloxacin were studied in six clinically healthy hanwoo cows after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.)  administration at a dose of 3 mg/kg. orbifloxacin concentrations were determined  by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. steady-state volume of distribution and clearance of orbifloxacin after i.v. administration were 0.92 l/kg and 0.24 l/h x kg, respectively. following i.m. administration, a slow and complete absorption with absolute bioavailability of 101.4%, and a maximum concentration (c(max)) of 1.17 microg/ml at 1.04 h were observed. the in vitro serum protein binding was 14.76%. the in vitro antibacterial activity of orbifloxacin against a pathogenic strain of mannheimia  haemolytica (m. haemolytica), escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was determined. the ex vivo activity of orbifloxacin against m. haemolytica strain was also determined, and these data were integrated with the ex vivo bacterial counts to establish auc(24h)/mic values producing bacteriostatic action, bactericidal action and elimination of bacteria. mean values were 32.7, 51.6 and 102.6 h, respectively. from these data, we predict that orbifloxacin, when administered i.m. at a dosage of 2.5-5 mg/kg once a day,  would be effective against bovine pathogens, such as m. haemolytica. additional studies may be needed to confirm its efficacy in a clinical setting, and to evaluate the penetration of the drug in diseased tissues.

TI  == risk factors and impacts of clinical and subclinical mastitis in commercial meat-producing sheep flocks in quebec, canada.
AB  == we conducted a prospective observational study on clinical and subclinical mastitis in 30 commercial meat-producing sheep flocks from 2 regions of the province of quebec, canada. a total of 2,792 ewes selected in late gestation were followed from lambing to weaning of lambs. the incidence of clinical mastitis for the total lactation period (average of 58 days) ranged among flocks from 0 to 6.6%, with a median of 1.2%. the most frequently isolated bacteria from the cases of clinical mastitis, in pure or mixed culture, were mannheimia haemolytica (26%), staphylococcus aureus (23%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (17%). incidence of clinical mastitis was higher in ewes that gave birth to 3 or more lambs and from the estrie region, and was associated with an increase in ewe mortality, an increase in lamb mortality at the litter level, and a decrease in lamb's weaning weight for lambs born in multiple litter size or from ewes >or=4 years old. among 354 selected ewes with clinically normal udder at the end of lactation, 28.8% had potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated from milk. the most prevalent bacteria were s. aureus (9.3%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (9.3%). the risk of having a positive culture in at least one half was different  between the two regions. prevalence of ewes (n=261) with california mastitis test (cmt) positive result in at least one half was 24.1 and 14.9% using a cut-off of  >or=1+ and >or=2+, respectively. prevalence of culture-positive udder halves was  11.7% for cmt-negative compared with 53.6% for cmt 3+ halves. cmt status was positively associated with the isolation of coagulase-negative staphylococci, m.  haemolytica, s. aureus, and various streptococcus species, but not with other isolated bacteria. additionally, prevalence of cmt-positive halves was higher in  ewes from the estrie region, aged of >or=4 years versus 1 year, having clinical mastitis previously detected in the lactation and/or with low body condition score. lamb weaning weight was associated with cmt status of ewes, while weaning  weight was not associated with milk culture results. more research is needed to understand the dynamic of milk scc and imi in ewes from meat-producing flocks, its economical impact and best ways to control it.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different european countries: 2002-2004.
AB  == background: the project "antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - ii" (arbao-ii) was funded by the european union (fair5-qlk2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in european countries  based on validated and harmonised methodologies. available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. method: antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.a proficiency test (eqas - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test  the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. the data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the eqas the results are comparable between countries. results: data  from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 european countries. for staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. for mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in france, the netherlands and portugal.  all isolates of pasteurella multocida isolated in finland and most of those from  denmark, england (and wales), italy and sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis isolates from sweden were fully susceptible. for the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. more resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. conclusion: in general, isolates from denmark, england (and wales), the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from belgium, france, italy, latvia and spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. in the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.

TI  == teat lesions predispose to invasion of the ovine mammary gland by mannheimia haemolytica.
AB  == teat lesions, produced in ewes by an experimental chapping procedure, were found  to facilitate experimental infection with mannheimia haemolytica, as assessed by  observations on infection of the teat skin, teat duct and mammary gland, and on the production of mastitis. the origin of the m. haemolytica strain used (ovine tonsillar or mammary infection) did not appear to influence the results. in a second experiment, in which ewes continued to suckle their lambs but were not deliberately infected, chapping was shown to favour infection by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and m. haemolytica.

TI  == clinical mastitis in ewes; bacteriology, epidemiology and clinical features.
AB  == background: clinical mastitis is an important disease in sheep. the objective of  this work was to identify causal bacteria and study certain epidemiological and clinical features of clinical mastitis in ewes kept for meat and wool production. methods: the study included 509 ewes with clinical mastitis from 353 flocks located in 14 of the 19 counties in norway. clinical examination and collection of udder secretions were carried out by veterinarians. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was performed on 92 staphylococcus aureus isolates from 64 ewes. results and conclusion: s. aureus was recovered from 65.3% of 547 clinically affected mammary glands, coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2.9%, enterobacteria, mainly escherichia coli, from 7.3%, streptococcus spp. from 4.6%, mannheimia haemolytica from 1.8% and various other bacteria from 4.9%, while no bacteria were cultured from 13.2% of the samples. forty percent of the ewes with  unilateral clinical s. aureus mastitis also had a subclinical s. aureus infection in the other mammary gland. twenty-four of 28 (86%) pairs of s. aureus isolates obtained from clinically and subclinically affected mammary glands of the same ewe were indistinguishable by pfge. the number of identical pairs was significantly greater than expected, based on the distribution of different s. aureus types within the flocks. one-third of the cases occurred during the first  week after lambing, while a second peak was observed in the third week of lactation. gangrene was present in 8.8% of the clinically affected glands; s. aureus was recovered from 72.9%, clostridium perfringens from 6.3% and e. coli from 6.3% of the secretions from such glands. this study shows that s. aureus predominates as a cause of clinical ovine mastitis in norway, also in very severe cases. results also indicate that s. aureus is frequently spread between udder halves of infected ewes.

TI  == clinical, bacteriological, cytological and pathological features of teat disorders in ewes.
AB  == we describe the features of 13 cases of teat disorders in ewes, as follows: lengthy teats (one case), papilloma infection (two), staphylococcal dermatitis (one), nodules and abscesses (two), teat bites (three), stenosis (one), orf (two), compressed teat (one). mannheimia haemolytica, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans or staphylococcus aureus were isolated from samples. sub-epithelial leucocytic infiltration at the teat duct-teat cistern border, but  not lymphoid nodules, was the salient histological finding in the teat. leucocytic infiltration and destruction of parenchyma were evident in the mammary gland. the results provide field evidence suggesting that teat lesions predispose ewes to mastitis.

TI  == potential pathogens carried by spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern spain.
AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == bacteriology and somatic cell counts in milk samples from ewes on a scottish farm.
AB  == milk samples from 50 sheep on a single scottish research farm were collected weekly for 10 wk postpartum. samples were analyzed for somatic cell counts (scc)  each week and bacteriologic culture was done for 7 of the 10 wk. a total of 492 udder half samples were cultured, of which 467 had corresponding cell count data. statistical analysis on complete scc and culture data showed no association between scc and bacterial isolation, even when more than 10 colonies of a single  bacterial species were present. only 3.6% of the samples were simultaneously positive for high count (> 10 colonies from 0.01 ml of milk) of any one bacterial species and high scc (> 1 x 10(6)/ml). the bacteria recovered were: staphylococcus equorum (19 times), s. xylosus (7 times), s. simulans (6 times), streptococcus uberis (3 times) and other streptococci (4 times), mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica (2 times), staphylococcus aureus (1 time), s. capitis (1 time), and enterococcus faecium (1 time). there was an association between the test day and scc, with higher scc values in the first 2 wk. in addition, significantly higher scc values were found in the oldest animals compared to the  other age groups.

TI  == seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight european countries.
AB  == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the  use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen  was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995  to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

TI  == the effects of danofloxacin and tilmicosin on neutrophil function and lung consolidation in beef heifer calves with induced pasteurella (mannheimia) haemolytica pneumonia.
AB  == pneumonia caused by pasteurella (mannheimia) haemolytica was induced in weaned beef heifer calves, approximately 6 months of age. calves were treated at 20 h after challenge with therapeutic doses of danofloxacin or tilmicosin. peripheral  blood neutrophils were collected at 3, 24 and 48 h after treatment. the ex vivo effects on neutrophil function, neutrophil apoptosis, and hematological parameters were examined, as was the effect on percentage lung consolidation. neutrophil function assays included random migration under agarose, cytochrome c  reduction, iodination, staphylococcus aureus ingestion, chemotaxis, and antibody-dependent and antibody-independent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. apoptosis was determined using a cell death detection kit. killing was performed at 72 h after treatment. statistical comparisons were made among the three groups of challenged-treated animals: saline, danofloxacin, and tilmicosin. comparisons were also made between nonchallenged nontreated animals (nch) and challenged saline-treated animals. there were no significant differences for any of the neutrophil function assays or neutrophil apoptosis among the challenged-treated groups. this suggests that danofloxacin and tilmicosin have no clinically significant effects on neutrophil function or apoptosis. there were also no significant differences in percentage lung consolidation among the challenged-treated groups. significant differences were found between the nch calves and the challenged saline-treated calves in several neutrophil assays, which were attributed to effects of p. haemolytica infection.

TI  == effect of interleukin-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on priming and  activation of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == neutrophils are important effector cells in innate and acquired immunity, but the magnitude and character of their phagocytic and bactericidal responses depend on  cues derived from mediators in the local microenvironment. this study investigated the effect of bovine interleukin-8 (il-8) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) on priming and activation of bovine neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. neutrophils were isolated from blood and cultured for up to 18 h, with or without cytokines, and then mannheimia haemolytica-induced oxidative burst and phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus were measured by flow cytometry. neither il-8 nor g-csf directly triggered an oxidative burst, but incubation with these cytokines for 18 h primed neutrophils for a greater oxidative burst triggered by m. haemolytica and for enhanced uptake of s. aureus. the maximal response was observed when neutrophils were incubated with both cytokines together, at concentrations of 200 ng/ml for g-csf and 400 ng/ml for il-8. the il-8-induced priming effect was reduced by treatment with a neutralizing antibody to il-8, and was not attributed to endotoxin contamination. instillation of il-8 into the lung using a bronchoscope induced neutrophil recruitment within 18 h. neutrophils from il-8-treated lung showed dose-dependent enhancement of the oxidative burst triggered by m. haemolytica. histologically, neutrophils filled alveoli and bronchioles, and scattered macrophages contained neutrophils with morphological features of apoptosis. thus, prolonged in vitro or in vivo exposure to il-8 and/or g-csf enhances the subsequent oxidative burst and phagocytic responses of bovine neutrophils.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

AB  == an experiment was designed to study the in vivo effect of pasteurella haemolytica a2 infection on the phagocytosis activity of caprine broncho-alveolar macrophages and the extent of pneumonic lesions. twelve healthy local kacang goats, about 7 months of age, were divided into two groups of six. goats in group 1 were inoculated intratracheally with 4 ml inoculum containing 2.8 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of staphylococcus aureus. goats in group 2 were inoculated intratracheally with 4 ml of inoculum containing 9.5 x 10(8) cfu/ml of pasteurella haemolytica a2 isolated earlier from pneumonic lungs of goat. at intervals of 3 and 7 days post-challenge five goats from each group were killed and the lungs were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. smears were prepared from the lung washing fluid and the number of macrophages with phagocytic activity was determined. at day 3 post-infection, goats of both groups showed a similar pattern of pneumonic lesion. the lung washing fluid of goats in  group 2 was found to contain numerous neutrophils and macrophages. goats in group 2 showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher extent of lung lesions than group 1. similarly, the average extent of lung lesions was significantly (p < 0.05) more severe in group 2 at day 7 post-infection. the lung washing fluid contained mostly macrophages. the phagocytic activity following s. aureus infection was more efficient and significantly (p < 0.01) higher compared with infection by p.  haemolytica a2. there were weak correlations between the extent of pneumonic lesion and the phagocytic activity. thus, goats with poor phagocytic activity were likely to develop more extensive lung lesions.

AB  == pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1 (s1) is the bacterium most frequently recovered from the lungs of cattle that have succumbed to shipping fever pneumonia. p. haemolytica outer membrane proteins (omps) are important immunogens in the development of resistance to pneumonic pasteurellosis. the purpose of this study was to identify the repertoire of immunogenic, surface-exposed p. haemolytica (s1) omps, that could be important in the development of protective immunity. we determined surface exposure of omps by (1) their susceptibility to protease treatment and (2) their ability to adsorb out antibodies from bovine immune sera. for a comprehensive identification of immunogenic, surface-exposed omps, we used bovine antisera from calves that were resistant to experimental p.  haemolytica challenge after (1) natural exposure to p. haemolytica, (2) vaccination with live p. haemolytica, or (3) vaccination with p. haemolytica omps. we identified 21 immunogenic, surface-exposed p. haemolytica omps. most were recognized by all three immune sera. however, some were recognized by one or two of the three antisera. our analyses identified surface-exposed, immunogenic proteins that were not identified in previous studies.

TI  == bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (h) versus unhealthy (uh) animals with respiratory signs. the prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper  and lower respiratory tract of h and uh najdi sheep, somali sheep and holstein calves. the characteristics of pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of pasteurella haemolytica were identified in h and uh animals, eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of uh najdi and somali sheep and holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of uh sheep were moraxella spp., pseudomonas pseudomallei, erysipelothrix spp., pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in uh calves were pasteurella haemolytica, actinomyces spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of uh animals, namely actinomyces pyogenes, erysipelothrix spp., p. haemolytica, pasteurella ureae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of  the animals surveyed. of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified p. haemolytica and p. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from uh  as compared to those from h animals. these were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of p. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of p. multocida recovered from healthy animals. the  only biotype of p. haemolytica isolated from h animals was biotype a, while both  biotypes a (88.0% of the isolates) and t (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from uh animals.

TI  == coagglutination test for serotyping pasteurella haemolytica.
AB  == a coagglutination test was described for simple, fast, and reliable detection of  pasteurella haemolytica type-specific antigens in lung lesions even in the absence of viable p. haemolytica. the coagglutinating reagents were prepared by coating protein a-producing staphylococcus aureus cells with hyperimmune sera raised against p. haemolytica type strains. bacterial suspensions, saline extracts, and boiled saline extracts of the bacteria were used as antigens. homologous reactions with all types of antigens were precise. some cross-reactions were similar to those obtained by the indirect hemagglutination test, and some additional one-way cross-reactions were identified. the coagglutination test was used for serotyping 65 p. haemolytica field strains and  for the detection of p. haemolytica type-specific antigens in the lung specimens  of 62 calves and 78 sheep. ninety-four percent of the field strains could be serotyped by the coagglutination test. p. haemolytica type-specific antigens were detected in the lung specimens of 3 calves and 5 sheep that had succumbed to naturally occurring p. haemolytica pneumonia and in the lungs of 20 calves experimentally infected with p. haemolytica a1. the coagglutination test detected type-specific antigens in 36% of the lung specimens of slaughtered field sheep but not in the lungs of slaughtered field cattle with small chronic lung lesions. no reaction occurred in the case of nonpneumonic calves and sheep or when pneumonic lesions were caused by other bacteria. no p. haemolytica strains could  be isolated from lung samples that were coagglutination test negative. this test  is recommended as an additional method for fast and reliable serotyping of p. haemolytica.

TI  == effect of recombinant bovine interleukin-1 beta on viral/bacterial pneumonia in cattle.
AB  == bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1) is an important pathogen of respiratory infections in cattle. its continuing importance lies in its ability to predispose infected hosts to bacterial infections (e.g., pasteurella haemolytica). in this study we determined whether the immunoregulatory effects induced by recombinant bovine interleukin-1 (rbil-1) could stimulate appropriate host defense mechanisms to influence the course of bhv-1 and p. haemolytica infection in cattle. we first evaluated the effect of multiple doses (5 doses of 300 ng/kg) of rbil-1 in normal cattle. an increase in polymorphonuclear (pmn) cells, as well as monocytes, in peripheral blood was observed during the course of il-1 administration. in addition, the phagocytic activity of monocytes was increased. although the phagocytic and oxidative burst activities in pmn decreased during the course of rbil-1 treatment, no changes were observed in the bactericidal capacity of these  cells. lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood remained unchanged; however, the functional activity of these cells, as measured by ifn-gamma production upon in vitro stimulation, was decreased. in the bovine respiratory disease model, multiple administration of il-1 did not influence significantly the progression of bhv-1/p. haemolytica infection in cattle. thus, our results demonstrated that  il-1, although not therapeutically effective, could be administered safely as an  adjuvant, even during the course of bhv-1/p. haemolytica infection.

TI  == proposed quality control guidelines for antimicrobial susceptibility tests using  tilmicosin.
AB  == quality control guidelines for tilmicosin, a novel veterinary-use-only macrolide, were developed in a multi-laboratory study according to established national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) procedures (m23-t2). tilmicosin was incorporated into sensititre plates for broth microdilution endpoint testing and into two lots of 15-micrograms disks for kirby-bauer agar disk diffusion testing. one common lot and five unique lots of mueller-hinton media were used. (broth was cation adjusted, and agar was supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood.) bacteria used for reference strains included pasteurella haemolytica 128k, pasteurella multocida atcc 43137, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 (microdilution) and atcc 25923 (disk). replicate tests were conducted. disk diffusion and broth microdilution quality control ranges are proposed.

TI  == [clinical, diagnostic laboratory and therapeutic studies of mastitis in a large sheep breeding flock].
AB  == during two lambing seasons, 6500 ewes of a large sheep breeding unit were investigated. within this period, 467 ewes suffered from mastitis. the morbidity  was 3.8% and the lethality 4.7%. in 84% of the investigated animals udder-pathogenic bacteria were detected. mostly, pasteurella haemolytica and staphylococcus aureus were isolated as agents of ovine mastitis. before and during the antibiotic therapy the clinical symptoms (general condition, temperature, milk appearance, consistency of the udder tissue) were recorded. the combined antibiotic therapy, which consisted of parenteral and local intracisternal applications, was mostly satisfactory concerning recovery from mastitis and survival of the ewes. only 17 ewes died from mastitis; most deaths caused by staphylococcus aureus.
