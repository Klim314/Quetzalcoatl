TI  - Influence of the Periodontal Status on the Initial-Biofilm Formation on Titanium  Surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. The bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (Ti) surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study. The subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed Ti surfaces for 48 hours. Microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each Ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: Despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the Ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each of the study groups. However, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the Ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. Treponema denticola, Neisseria mucosa, Eikenella corrodens, and Tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the Ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Streptococcus mitis were detected on the Ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize Ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the Ti implant.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. Recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. The causative bacterial species in Israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of LAgP in this population. The objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an Israeli LAgP population who were also clinically assessed. METHODS: Twenty-one LAgP patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. Bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. RESULTS: Higher levels of Parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), Fusobacterium nucleatum/F. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and Tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the LAgP group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were higher in the CP group. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of LAgP patients in Israel is mainly comprised of P. micra, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum/F. periodonticum and T. forsythia. Similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of LAgP when individual sampling is not possible.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (SD +/- 10.3)) (NS by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). Bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. RESULTS: Mean PPD changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5 and 1.8 mm, respectively (NS between groups). BOP in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. At 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were found in the test group (site level): Fusobacterium species, Parvimonas micra, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). At week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, P. micra, and T. denticola. CONCLUSIONS: At 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar BOP and PPD improvements. At week 26 and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of Fusobacterium, P. micra, and T. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in PPD or BOP.
TI  - [Expression of cytokines in dentogingival sulcus in patients after dental implantation and during development of peri-implantitis].
AB  - AIM: Determination of cytokine content in various areas of dentition in patients  with peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of I and II order. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 patients with complications that developed in 3 months to 14 years after installation of intraosteal dental implants were examined. Content of cytokines in various areas of dentition was determined by using solid phase enzyme immunoassay in patients with developed peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of I and II order. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for determination of parodontopathogenic bacteria marker DNA. RESULTS: Marker DNA of I order parodontopathogenic bacteria - Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia (Bacteroides forsythus), Porphyromonas gingivalis in peri-implantation tissues during implant rejection was detected with 34.4 - 75% frequency while II order (Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micros (Peptostreptococcus micros), Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum etc.) - with significantly lower frequency. Total concentration of IL- 1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL- 17A and INFgamma in contents of pathological pocket in the area of implants and the levels of each of them were significantly higher than in the contents of parodontal pockets, areas with stable implants and gingival fluid from areas with healthy teeth. Total interleukin content in the contents of pathological pockets in the area of rejected implants was significantly higher than in other studied areas. In the exudate of parodontal pockets of the preserved teeth it was 2.4 times lower, in the area of stable implants - 4.6 times lower, and in the areas with healthy teeth - 4.8 times lower than with rejected implants (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the study conducted allow to make a conclusion regard- ing reasonability of monitoring during dental implantation of parodontopathogenic microorganism strains and local cytokine response of the host organism with the objective of rational prophylaxis and therapy of inflammatory complications.
TI  - Co-localized or randomly distributed? Pair cross correlation of in vivo grown subgingival biofilm bacteria quantified by digital image analysis.
AB  - The polymicrobial nature of periodontal diseases is reflected by the diversity of phylotypes detected in subgingival plaque and the finding that consortia of suspected pathogens rather than single species are associated with disease development. A number of these microorganisms have been demonstrated in vitro to interact and enhance biofilm integration, survival or even pathogenic features. To examine the in vivo relevance of these proposed interactions, we extended the spatial arrangement analysis tool of the software daime (digital image analysis in microbial ecology). This modification enabled the quantitative analysis of microbial co-localization in images of subgingival biofilm species, where the biomass was confined to fractions of the whole-image area, a situation common for medical samples. Selected representatives of the disease-associated red and orange complexes that were previously suggested to interact with each other in vitro (Tannerella forsythia with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis with Prevotella intermedia) were chosen for analysis and labeled with specific fluorescent probes via fluorescence in situ hybridization. Pair cross-correlation analysis of in vivo grown biofilms revealed tight clustering of F. nucleatum/periodonticum and T. forsythia at short distances (up to 6 microm) with a pronounced peak at 1.5 microm. While these results confirmed previous in vitro observations for F. nucleatum and T. forsythia, random spatial distribution was detected between P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in the in vivo samples. In conclusion, we successfully employed spatial arrangement analysis on the single cell level in clinically relevant medical samples and demonstrated the utility of this approach for the in vivo validation of in vitro observations by analyzing statistically relevant numbers of different patients. More importantly, the culture-independent nature of this approach enables similar quantitative analyses for "as-yet-uncultured" phylotypes which cannot be characterized in vitro.
TI  - Effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in Japan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. To clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. The aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of Japanese patients with periodontitis. METHODS: Sixty-seven Japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in the present study. They consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. Periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) and oral hygiene status were recorded. Detection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, Treponema denticola and Campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. Association between the detection of periodontopathic bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. RESULTS: A statistically significant association was found between having a PPD >/= 4 mm and detection of T. denticola, P. intermedia, T. forsythia, or C. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. A significant association was noted between BOP and the detection of C. rectus or P. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. Prevalence of C. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of A. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including C. rectus.
TI  - Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  - Oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. In this study, the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time PCR. Forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. Approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and DNA was obtained. Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific TaqMan probe/primer sets. Total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial DNA were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. All periodontal bacteria except for the F. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their DNA represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial DNA obtained from periodontitis patients. Porphyromonas gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia were detected most often. The presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. In addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial DNA could be observed. The significant number of periodontopathic bacterial DNA species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.
TI  - Salivary microbiota of HIV-positive children and its correlation with HIV status, oral diseases, and total secretory IgA.
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of salivary microorganisms in HIV-positive children, and their correlation to HIV status, oral lesions, and salivary IgA levels. DESIGN: Forty-two HIV-positive and 36 control children were clinically examined, had their saliva collected and processed for the microbiological analysis of 38 bacterial taxa by the checkerboard method, and salivary IgA quantification by ELISA. RESULTS: The majority of the species tested were more prevalent in control children than in the HIV group. Mean concentration of total salivary IgA was similar in both groups. High levels of Veillonella parvula were found in children with cheilitis and herpes. Tannerella forsythia, Eikenella Corrodens, and Propionibacterium acnes were prevalent in children with gingivitis, while Fusobacterium periodonticum, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis were significantly more frequent in children with no oral lesions. Significant negative correlations between salivary IgA levels and Eubacterium nodatum and oral streptococci were observed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIV-seropositive children presented significantly lower prevalence and levels of several bacterial species in saliva; HIV-positive children are able to mount a mucosal immune response; HIV-seropositive children under highly active antiretroviral therapy presented low prevalence of oral lesions.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  - Studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling methods. The purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and GCF samples using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. Plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. A total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (SD+/-4.7). On average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (SD+/-2.9). The proportion of Streptococcus oralis (P<0.02) and Fusobacterium periodonticum (P<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). The GCF samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (P-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). The proportions of Tannerella forsythia (T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola were both higher in GCF samples (P<0.02 and P<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). The microbial composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of Porphyromonas gingivalis. A combination of GCF and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.
