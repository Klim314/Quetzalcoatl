antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.
[characterization and antibacterial effect of ag-nha-ntio2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
objective: undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (ag-nha-ntio2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (pa66) by co-polymerization method. the purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. methods: the morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (aas), x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscope (sem) and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (edx). staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), escherichia coli (e. coli), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. results: xrd results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (ha). a homogeneous distribution of the ca, p, ti and ag element in the membrane was confirmed by edx. both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by sem and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. the bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of s. aureus and 56.31% of e. coli were killed. however, 91.84% of p. gingivalis, 90.64% of f. nucleatum and 90.49% of s. mutans were killed and pictures of sem showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. conclusion: the nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
genetic and biochemical characterization of fus-1 (oxa-85), a narrow-spectrum class d beta-lactamase from fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. an f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. dna cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class d beta-lactamase named fus-1 (oxa-85). a recombinant escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(fus-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate decrease in the mics with clavulanic acid. the bla(fus-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. it was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class d beta-lactamase gene. the fus-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with oxa-63 from brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). fus-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class d beta-lactamases. kinetic analysis revealed that fus-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. fus-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and nacl. fus-1 is the first example of a class d beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.
3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
human gingival epithelial cells (hge) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) and hbd-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. in the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hbd-2 was examined. hbd-2 mrna was induced by cell wall extract of fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. hbd-2 mrna was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (pma), an epithelial cell activator. hbd-2 mrna was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed gingival tissue samples. hbd-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in hge stimulated with f. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mrna by this stimulant. kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hbd-2 mrna; tnf-alpha and f. nucleatum cell wall induced hbd-2 mrna rapidly (2 to 4 h), while pma stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). in contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (il-8) within 1 h. the role of tnf-alpha as an intermediary in f. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-tnf-alpha that did not inhibit hbd-2 induction. however, inhibitor studies show that f. nucleatum stimulation of hbd-2 mrna requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from escherichia coli and f. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hbd-2, although they up-regulated il-8 mrna. collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hbd-2 mrna via multiple pathways in hge in a pattern that is distinct from that of il-8 expression. we suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.
induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.
effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.
the effect of cyclosporin and lipopolysaccharide on fibroblasts: implications for cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.
drug-induced gingival overgrowth is an adverse side effect associated principally with 3 different types of drugs; specifically the antiepileptic phenytoin, the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine, and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin. the present study has analyzed the effect of cyclosporin and lipopolysaccharide on fibroblasts from 3 different sources: 1) normal healthy human gingiva (nhgf); 2) overgrown gingiva from 2 patients taking cyclosporin (chgf); and 3) human fetal lung (wi-38). fibroblasts isolated from cyclosporin-associated gingival overgrowth were significantly less responsive to cyclosporin in terms of dna, total protein, and proteoglycan synthesis. this finding supports the in vivo response where few fibroblasts are seen but marked overgrowth of fibrous tissue occurs. lipopolysaccharide derived from fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli was capable of inhibiting dna synthesis significantly in all 3 fibroblast types. total protein synthesis by chgf cells was inhibited differentially by fusobacterium nucleatum lps and addition of cyclosporin to this system resulted in reversal of the inhibition. a synergistic effect was noted when the proteoglycan output of nhgf cells was assessed in response to co-incubation with cyclosporin and escherichia coli lps. the study shows that bacterial lps may be an important co-factor in the pathogenesis of cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.
the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used, but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.
