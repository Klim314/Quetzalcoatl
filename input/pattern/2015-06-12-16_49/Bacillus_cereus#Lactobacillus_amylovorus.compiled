TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Synergistic effects of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer and nisin on bacterial growth.
AB  - We have previously described a murein hydrolase activity for the surface layer (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356. Here we show that, in combination with nisin, this S-layer acts synergistically to inhibit the growth of pathogenic Gram-negative Salmonella enterica and potential pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. In addition, bacteriolytic effects were observed for the Gram-positive species tested. We postulate that the S-layer enhances the access of nisin into the cell membrane by enabling it to cross the cell wall, while nisin provides the sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force required to enhance the S-layer murein hydrolase activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  - Milkfat globule membranes (MFGMs) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. These membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri. Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. Bovine MFGM fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.
TI  - Lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  - Twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, C. perfringens). Two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. Isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as L. crispatus or L. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of S. aureus, B. cereus and E. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. Diarrhea-causing E. coli O8K88H9 Ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of L. reuteri 12/26. Mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial compound produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced higher antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and could be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent were located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Chromosomal-gene-mediated inhibition of intestinal and foodborne pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.).

These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Influence of controlled lactic fermentation on growth and sporulation of Bacillus cereus in milk.
AB  - The growth and sporulation of Bacillus cereus NVH 45 in a fermentor with controlled pH or simulated pH conditions were investigated. The study was carried out in a fermentor to measure the influence of a rapid and a slow lactic acid production on the inhibition of B. cereus in a controlled environment during the initial part of fermentation and to observe if other factors than lactic acid influenced the inhibition. In the controlled pH experiments the pH was allowed to decrease to an end pH 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0 either by Lactobacillus casei 2756 (a fast acid producer) or Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748 (a slow acid producer). In co-cultures of Lb. casei 2756 and B. cereus NVH 45, low numbers (10-70 cfu/ml) of B. cereus NVH 45 were observed at end pH 5.5 (72 h) while at pH 5.0 no viable cells (<10 cfu/ml) were detected (48-72 h). B. cereus NVH 45 did not sporulate in co-culture with Lb. casei 2756. In co-culture with Lb. acidophilus NCFB 1748, B. cereus NVH 45 sporulated and survived as spores. In these co-cultures B. cereus NVH 45 grew to higher maximum counts (>10(7) cfu/ml) than with Lb. casei 2756 (<10(7) cfu/ml). Significantly different amounts of lactic acid were observed between the two co-cultures after 7 and 12 h. A rapid decrease of pH appears to prevent B. cereus from sporulating and it seems that it is enough to just reach pH 5.0 rapidly and keep that pH to achieve the desirable inhibition of B. cereus. In the simulated pH experiments B. cereus NVH 45 was inoculated in the fermentor and the different pH developments from different LAB strains were monitored by addition of lactic acid. These experiments showed the same tendency: a fast pH reduction during the initial hours of fermentation, simulating lactococci, resulted in complete inhibition of B. cereus NVH 45 (<10 cfu/ml). However, when simulating the pH development of the two different Lactobacillus strains, complete inhibition of B. cereus NVH 45 was not seen. In co-cultures competition for nutrients with consequences for cell density appears to be important. Based on these results it seems that B. cereus must reach a certain density to induce sporulation.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  - Twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (Alcaligenes faecalis, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Geotrichum candidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Penicillium expansum, Pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Ser. Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. They were also tested for specific activity against S. aureus 9144 and B. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. Honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. Some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. The ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. Antibacterially active samples in this study included Montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. Furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. Varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of S. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. Mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. B. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included A. faecalis and L. acidophilus. Non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against B. stearothermophilus. Further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Plantaricin LP84, a broad spectrum heat-stable bacteriocin of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2084 produced in a simple glucose broth medium.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2084 produced an antibacterial substance when grown  at 40 degrees C for 36 h in a laboratory medium. The antibacterial substance was active against a wide range of bacteria comprising Gram positive and negative foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. However, related mesophilic lactobacilli were not inhibited, except for L. amylovorus DSM 20531. The antimicrobial activity was observed between late log and stationary growth phases. The antibacterial substance was partially purified through concentration under vacuum, followed by extraction with methanol and acetone (M-A extract). On fractionation of the M-A extract through Sephadex G-25, the activity was present in an eluant volume of 85 to 100 ml (peak I), indicating an apparent molecular mass of between 1 and 5 kDa and the purification attained was 80-fold. The antimicrobial principle was stable to heat (121 degrees C for 20 min) and catalase, but sensitive to trypsin and chymotrypsin, indicating it to be a bacteriocin. The M-A extract exhibited a bactericidal and lytic effect against Bacillus cereus F 4810 and Escherichia coli D 21. The ability of L. plantarum NCIM 2084 to produce an effective bacteriocin in a simple growth medium is of potential interest in its application as a biopreservative in traditional fermented foods.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Effects of three microbial probiotics on postprandial porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose, galactose and amino-nitrogen in the young pig.
AB  - Postprandial kinetics of porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose (G), galactose (Gal), L-lactic acid (LA) and amino-N (AN) were studied in the piglet after the ingestion of 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) Sporolactobacillus P44 (SP), or 10(6) cfu Bacillus cereus IP5832 (AC), or 10(6) cfu of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis (AB)/g feed. Sixteen fistulated piglets (portal vein and brachiocephalic trunk; mean body weight 22 (SD 2) kg) were used. The diet was based on skimmed milk (320 g/kg), barley (300 g/kg), wheat bran (110 g/kg), maize (100 g/kg) and lactose (70 g/kg). The postprandial blood kinetics, four measurements per animal at 1-week intervals, were studied for 6 h after the ingestion of test meals of 400 g basal diet (BD) or this diet supplemented with the bacteria (SP, AC and AB respectively). Areas of porto-arterial concentration differences (APACD) of G, Gal and LA were not influenced by the bacteria supplements. APACD of AN was significantly higher after the ingestion of the SP diet than that estimated for BD.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin B, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46.
AB  - Approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. Only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. Lactobacillus salivarius M7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin B which inhibits the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. A new atypical bacteriocin produced by Lact. acidophilus M46, acidocin B, combines the inhibition of Clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus Lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. Acidocin B is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees C for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. Native acidocin B occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kDa), while with SDS-PAGE the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kDa. Optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin B produced during growth. Growth is not necessary for acidocin B production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. The application potential of acidocin B is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured Indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
TI  - Effects of Lactic Acid Bacteria and Organic Acids on Growth and Germination of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of Bacillus cereus were affected by Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. Growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by B. cereus. B. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 CFU/ml when cells were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of B. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. Spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. Acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 M) completely inactivated multiplication of B. cereus at pH 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. Spores of B. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. Formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 M) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at pH 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.
TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.
TI  - Microstructure of colonies of rod-shaped bacteria.
AB  - Whole colonies of Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium, B. mycoides CN2495, Corynebacterium hofmanni NCTC1938, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIB1899, Nocardia graminis NCTC4728, Pseudomonas viscosa, and Serratia marcescens were prepared for scanning electron microscopic examination by freeze-drying and metal-coating. The arrangement of individual cells within colonies could be seen. Cells of Bacillus colonies tended to be longer than in liquid culture and irregular in shape and to give the appearance of branching. B. megaterium colonies frequently had a dense covering film. Colonies of gram-negative bacteria consisted of fairly short rods covered by much adherent extracellular material. L. acidophilus had colonies comprised of densely packed, well-oriented rods. C. hofmanni colonies contained coccobacilli, packed together. Correlations were observed between plano-convex colony form and densely packed cells, rough colony form and random arrangement of well-separated microorganisms, and irregular colony edge and tendency of cells to grow out from the colony in filaments.
