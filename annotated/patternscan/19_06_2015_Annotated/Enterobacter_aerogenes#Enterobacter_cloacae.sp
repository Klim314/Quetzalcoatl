TI  == enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae; versatile bacterial pathogens confronting antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enterobacter aerogenes and e. cloacae have been reported as important opportunistic and multiresistant bacterial pathogens for humans during the last three decades in hospital wards. these gram-negative bacteria have been largely described during several outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in europe and  particularly in france. the dissemination of enterobacter sp. is associated with  the presence of redundant regulatory cascades that efficiently control the membrane permeability ensuring the bacterial protection and the expression of detoxifying enzymes involved in antibiotic degradation/inactivation. in addition, these bacterial species are able to acquire numerous genetic mobile elements that strongly contribute to antibiotic resistance. moreover, this particular fitness help them to colonize several environments and hosts and rapidly and efficiently  adapt their metabolism and physiology to external conditions and environmental stresses. enterobacter is a versatile bacterium able to promptly respond to the antibiotic treatment in the colonized patient. the balance of the prevalence, e.  aerogenes versus e. cloacae, in the reported hospital infections during the last  period, questions about the horizontal transmission of mobile elements containing antibiotic resistance genes, e.g., the efficacy of the exchange of resistance genes klebsiella pneumoniae to enterobacter sp. it is also important to mention the possible role of antibiotic use in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in this e. aerogenes/e. cloacae evolution.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from jatropha dioica roots.
AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant jatropha dioica (euphorbiaceae) were investigated. in order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis and sporothrix schenckii. results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. the activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. the hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines chang, ok and llcpk-1 (ic50>1000 mug ml(-1)).

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from humans in the community.
AB  == objective: to investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (esc)-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae  in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. methods: esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. esbl/ampc/carbapenemase genes were analysed using pcr and sequencing. for e. coli, phylogenetic groups and mlst were determined. plasmids were characterized by transformation and pcr-based replicon typing. subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. results: 175 esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. the isolates were escherichia coli(n=65), citrobacter freundii (n=52), enterobacter cloacae (n=38), morganella morganii (n=5), enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), hafnia alvei (n=2), shigella spp. (n=2), citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), escherichia hermannii (n=1), kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and pantoea agglomerans (n=1). the following esbl genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blactx-m-1 (n=17), blactx-m-15 (n=16), blactx-m-14 (n=9), blactx-m-2 (n=3), blactx-m-3 (n=2), blactx-m-24 (n=2), blactx-m-27 (n=1), blactx-m-32 (n=1), blashv-12 (n=2), blashv-65 (n=1) and blatem-52 (n=1). plasmidic ampc (pampc) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. one person carried two different e. coli isolates, one with blactx-m-1 and the other with blacmy-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying enterobacteriaceae harboring esbl and/or pampc genes was 5.2 %. in eight e. coli isolates the ampc phenotype was caused by mutations in the ampc promoter  region. no carbapenemase genes were identified. a large variety of e. coli genotypes was found, st131 and st10 being most common. conclusions: esbl/pampc genes resembled those from patients in dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. the role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.

TI  == clonal dissemination of oxa-370- producing klebsiella pneumoniae in rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == enzymes of the oxa-48-family have become one of the most important beta-lactamases in the world. a new oxa-48 variant (oxa-370) was first described  in an enterobacter hormaechei isolated in rio grande do sul (south region of brazil) in 2013. here we report the detection of the blaoxa-370 gene in 24 isolates belonging to three enterobacteriaceae species (22 in klebsiella pneumoniae, 01 in enterobacter cloacae and 01 in enterobacter aerogenes) from five hospitals in rio de janeiro in 2013 and 2014. the isolates showed a multidrug resistance profile and 12.5% were resistant to polymyxin b. besides blaoxa-370, no other carbapenemase genes were observed, by pcr, whereas blaoxa-1  was found in all isolates and 22 (91.6%) possessed blactx-m-15. molecular typing  by pfge in the k. pneumoniae isolates, showed the presence of two clonal groups (kpa - 21 isolates and kpb - 1 isolate). kpa was characterized as st16 and kpb as st1041 by mlst. st16 has been observed in kpc-producing k. pneumoniae in rio de janeiro. plasmid analysis performed in six oxa-370-representative isolates showed plasmids harboring the blaoxa-370 gene in all strains, ranging from 25 kb to 150  kb. thus, this study suggests that there is an urgent need to investigate the presence of oxa-370 and the dissemination of the clone k. pneumoniae st16 carrying this gene in brazil.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of kpc-2-producing enterobacteriaceae (non-klebsiella pneumoniae) isolated from brazil.
AB  == in brazil, since 2009, there has been an ever increasing widespread of the blakpc-2 gene, mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae. this study aims to assess the molecular epidemiology and genetic background of this gene in enterobacteriaceae  (non-k. pneumoniae) species from 9 brazilian states between 2009 and 2011. three  hundred eighty-seven isolates were analyzed exhibiting nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, in which the blakpc-2 gene was detected in 21.4%. by disk diffusion  and e-test, these isolates exhibited high rates of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested, including tigecycline (45.6% nonsusceptible) and polymyxin b (16.5%), the most resistant species being enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae. we found great clonal diversity and a variety of blakpc-2-carrying plasmids, all of them exhibiting a partial tn4401 structure. therefore, this study demonstrates the dissemination of kpc-2 in 9 enterobacteriaceae species, including species that were not previously described  such as pantoea agglomerans and providencia stuartii.

TI  == separation and confirmation of nine enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the gene.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to confirm the existence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae carrying the bla ndm-1 gene in clinics in hainan province, china. collected clinical bacterial isolates that were enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapenemase were used as experimental strains. drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (ip/ipi) e-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases. the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and agarose gel electrophoresis (age) and sequencing were conducted to identify the products. the species of the strains carrying the bla ndm-1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. through the ip/ipi e-test, 21 of the 30 collected enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70% of the strains produced metallo-beta-lactamases. following bla ndm-1 gene pcr amplification, age and sequencing tests confirmed that nine of the strains carried the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene. the biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were klebsiella pneumoniae, two were escherichia coli, two were enterobacter cloacae and one was enterobacter aerogenes. drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100% resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. however, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin b and tigecycline of 100 and 88.9%, respectively. the sensitivity rate  to amikacin was also high at 77.8%, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was moderate at rates of 44.4 and 33.3% respectively. this clinical study of enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the bla ndm-1 gene in hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == microbiological features of kpc-producing enterobacter isolates identified in a u.s. hospital system.
AB  == microbiological data regarding klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacter spp. are scarce. in this study, 11 unique kpc-producing enterobacter isolates were identified among 44 ertapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacter isolates collected between 2009 and 2013 at a hospital system in western pennsylvania. all cases were healthcare-associated and occurred in medically complex patients. while pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed diverse restriction patterns overall, multilocus sequence  typing identified enterobacter cloacae isolates with sequence types 93 and 171 from 2 hospitals each. the levels of carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations were highly variable. all isolates remained susceptible to colistin and tigecycline, and the majority, to amikacin and doxycycline. a blakpc-carrying incn plasmid conferring trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was identified in 3 of the isolates. spread of blakpc in enterobacter spp. appears to be due to  a combination of plasmid-mediated and clonal processes.

TI  == incidence rates of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in france: a prospective nationwide study in 2011-12.
AB  == objectives: to determine proportions and incidence rates of enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemase among those non-susceptible (ns) to carbapenems in france. methods: from november 2011 to april 2012, 71 laboratories recorded non-duplicate enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates ns to at least one carbapenem  and the total number of isolates of the different species. carbapenem mics were determined by broth microdilution and the beta-lactamase content by dna microarray. results: during the study period, the 71 laboratories identified 133  244 enterobacteriaceae isolates, of which 846 (0.63%) were ns to at least one carbapenem. carbapenem-ns isolates accounted for 0.07% (61/90 148) among escherichia coli isolates, 1.1% (111/10 436) among klebsiella pneumoniae, 8.2% (492/5971) among enterobacter cloacae and 4.0% (84/2104) among enterobacter aerogenes. among the 541 available carbapenem-ns isolates, 222 (including 63 randomly selected e. cloacae) were further analysed after confirmation of carbapenem non-susceptibility. none of the enterobacter spp. isolates produced carbapenemase. among the other species, 28 isolates produced carbapenemases (22 oxa-48, 4 kpc and 2 ndm), accounting for an estimated proportion of carbapenemase-producing isolates of 0.08% for all species, 0.01% for e. coli and  0.27% for k. pneumoniae. the incidence-density rate in the participating hospitals was 0.0041 per 1000 hospital-days and the incidence rate was 0.0027 per 100 admissions. conclusions: the incidence-density rate of carbapenemase-producing isolates per 1000 hospital-days was low and 30-fold lower than that of carbapenem-ns isolates (0.125) and almost 300-fold lower than that of esbl-producing isolates (1.104) in these french hospitals.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in north america 2010-2011.
AB  == the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. this report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in north america in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) identified in esbl-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of enterobacteriaceae. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. the incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), bla(ampc), and bla(kpc) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in madrid, spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae st11 isolates.
AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == emergence of carbapenemaseproducing klebsiella pneumoniae of sequence type 258 in michigan, usa.
AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. we aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as cpe by positive  modified hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the university of michigan health system (umhs). clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. available cpe isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the 16s rrna encoding gene and bla kpc locus. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to characterize klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. twenty six unique cpe isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. the majority were klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). other isolates included k. oxytoca (n=3), citrobacter freundii (n=2), enterobacter cloacae (n=2), enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and escherichia coli (n=1). molecular characterization of 19 available cpe  isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the kpc-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the kpc-2 allele. among 14 available k. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the kpc-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (st) 258. the other  2 (14%) k. pneumoniae isolates carried the kpc-2 allele and belonged to two unique sts. among these st 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. in contrast,  all cpe isolates carrying the kpc-2 allele and all non st 258 cpe isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing k. pneumoniae suggests that kpc-3 producing k. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (st 258), are emerging in our hospital. while st 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the united states, this study is the first to report its presence in michigan.

AB  == twelve nonduplicated kpc-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three escherichia coli, two citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae, four enterobacter aerogenes, and one klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (march 2011 to september 2012). two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by kpc-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with kpc-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. the majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. most isolates  carried bla(ctx-m) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16s rrna methylases (arma or rmtb). the genetic environment of  bla(kpc-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(kpc-2) on the plasmid pkp048, which contains an integration structure of a tn3-based transposon and partial tn4401 segment. inserted fragments (truncated bla(tem)) were detected upstream of the bla(kpc-2) gene for  two e. aerogenes strains. in conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. the outcome of infections caused by kpc-producing enterobacterial isolates and their  mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. the spread of bla(kpc-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in china was  mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the tn3-based transposons and not the bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == early aetiological agent identification of osteomyelitis with the light cycler septifast test from peripheral blood.
AB  == the commercial real-time pcr septifast test allows identification of 25 bacterial and fungal species directly from peripheral blood in patients with bloodstream infections. a 22-year-old caucasian woman reported an open femur fracture requiring a two step surgical procedure. after the second procedure the patient manifested sepsis and enterobacter cloacae/aerogenes dna was detected in the peripheral blood with the septifast. thereafter, femur osteomyelitis was diagnosed and e cloacae was cultured from intraoperative bone samples. the patient completed a 3-month course of antimicrobial therapy. five months after therapy was discontinued, the patient remained symptom free, but delayed bone consolidation occurs. molecular methods to identify aetiological agents in blood, in addition to conventional cultures, could represent an advantageous tool in clinical practice also in patients with post-traumatic bone infections.

TI  == epidemiology and molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacter spp., pantoea agglomerans, and serratia marcescens isolates from a bulgarian hospital.
AB  == forty-two extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pantoea agglomerans, and serratia marcescens, collected consecutively during the period january-november 2011 from  the university hospital in varna, bulgaria, were studied to characterize their esbls by isoelectric focusing, group-specific pcr, and sequencing. the epidemiological relationship was evaluated by random amplified polymorphic dna analysis (rapd). transferability of esbl genes was determined by conjugation experiments. plasmid analysis was done by replicon typing and psti fingerprinting. the overall rate of esbl production was 20%. the most widespread  enzyme was ctx-m-3, found in 64%. it was dominant in e. aerogenes (100%) and s. marcescens (83%). shv-12, ctx-m-3, and ctx-m-15 were found among e. cloacae isolates in 50%, 35%, and 45%, respectively. three main ctx-m-3-producing epidemic clones of e. aerogenes and s. marcescens have been detected. among e. cloacae isolates, six different rapd profiles were discerned. the plasmids harboring blactx-m-3 belonged to incl/m type and demonstrated similar psti fingerprinting profiles. incfii plasmids were detected in two ctx-m-15-producing  e. cloacae isolates. our results demonstrate wide intrahospital dissemination of  clonal e. aerogenes and s. marcescens isolates, carrying incl/m conjugative plasmids.

TI  == avibactam reverts the ceftazidime mic90 of european gram-negative bacterial clinical isolates to the epidemiological cut-off value.
AB  == objectives: ceftazidime-avibactam consists of the beta-lactam ceftazidime and the novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. the effect of avibactam on the ceftazidime mic frequency distribution of gram-negative european clinical  isolates was observed and compared to european committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) mic frequency distributions and epidemiological cut-off values (ecoffs) listed for ceftazidime. methods: ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam mics were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) reference broth microdilution methods for pseudomonas  aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., serratia spp., enterobacter spp.,  and proteus mirabilis isolates collected from medical centres in europe during 2009. results: the mic(90) values for ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam against p. aeruginosa isolates from a 2009 european surveillance programme were >32 and 8 mg/l, respectively. that is, the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime mic(90) for p. aeruginosa to the ecoff. similarly, the mic(90) values for ceftazidime against e. coli, klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and p. mirabilis were also reduced to the ecoff by the presence of avibactam. avibactam reduced the ceftazidime mic(90) value against collected enterobacter spp. to 1 mg/l (>32-fold reduction). no ecoff has been defined for enterobacter spp. however, it is 1 mg/l for enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae. conclusions: the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime mic(90) for gram-negative bacteria to the ecoff.

TI  == irreproducible and uninterpretable polymyxin b mics for enterobacter cloacae and  enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacter species are emerging nosocomial pathogens. as with most multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, the polymyxins are often the only therapeutic option. in this study involving clinical isolates of e. cloacae and e. aerogenes, susceptibility testing methods with polymyxin b were analyzed. all isolates underwent testing by the broth microdilution (in duplicate) and agar dilution (in duplicate) methods, and select isolates were examined by the etest method. selected isolates were also examined for heteroresistance by population analysis profiling. using a susceptibility breakpoint of </=2 mug/ml, categorical agreement by all four dilution tests (two  broth microdilution and two agar dilution) was achieved in only 76/114 (67%) of e. cloacae isolates (65 susceptible, 11 resistant). thirty-eight (33%) had either conflicting or uninterpretable results (multiple skip wells, i.e., wells that exhibit no growth although growth does occur at higher concentrations). of the 11 consistently resistant isolates, five had susceptible mics as determined by etest. heteroresistant subpopulations were detected in eight of eight isolates tested, with greater percentages in isolates with uninterpretable mics. for e. aerogenes, categorical agreement between the four dilution tests was obtained in  48/56 (86%), with conflicting and/or uninterpretable results in 8/56 (14%). for polymyxin susceptibility testing of enterobacter species, close attention must be paid to the presence of multiple skip wells, leading to uninterpretable results.  susceptibility also should not be assumed based on the results of a single test.  until the clinical relevance of skip wells is defined, interpretation of polymyxin susceptibility tests for enterobacter species should be undertaken with extreme caution.

TI  == [the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in newborn and the changes of isolated pathogens].
AB  == objective: to study the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in  newborn and the profiles of isolated pathogens. methods: the clinical data of 179 neonates in the previous group (from december 2005 to december 2008) and 331 neonates in the present group (from january 2009 to january 2012) admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and received mechanical ventilation for equal or longer than 48 hours were respectively reviewed and analyzed,and their isolated pathogen profile and drug sensitivity were also compared in two groups.  results: the incidence of vap in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (p > 0.05) was observed. gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. however, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens  in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were  klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. the drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (p < 0.05). the risk factors of vap include the duration of mechanical ventilation (or = 5.680, 95% ci: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (or = 2.219, 95% ci: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (or = 2. 127, 95% ci: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (or = 2.025, 95% ci: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (or = 2.012, 95% ci: 1.215-3.967). conclusions: according to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria  of vap were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics. the incidence of vap was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency of intubation, birth weight and the hospitalization as well as the neonatal asphyxia.

TI  == enterobacter and klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in valencia (spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. in this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in enterobacter and klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in valencia, spain). a total of 96  isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 enterobacter isolates (59 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes, two e. cancerogenus, one  e. gergoviae, and four e. sakazakii, currently cronobacter spp.), and 28 klebsiella isolates (19 k. oxytoca and 9 k. pneumoniae). only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. most isolates were  resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 enterobacter and 16 klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 e. cloacae isolates), four (one e. cloacae and one k. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two e. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. the presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. in addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance  determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == culture proven newborn sepsis with a special emphasis on late onset sepsis caused by enterobacteriaceae in a level iii neonatal care unit in astana, kazakhstan.
AB  == background: newborn sepsis is one of the major public health concerns worldwide.  also in our neonatal care unit, it is one of the major problems and especially infections with enterobacteriaceae were noted to pose an increasing problem in the last years. methods: data collection was done retrospectively for 2011. early onset sepsis was defined as having a positive blood culture within 72 h and late  onset sepsis after 72 h of delivery. results: out of 599 patients being admitted, 58 newborns were assessed having a neonatal sepsis. of these 58 newborns with sepsis, 11 were diagnosed within 72 h post delivery (early onset) and 47 were diagnosed after 72 h post delivery (late onset). the percentage of enterobacteriaceae causing late onset sepsis was 57.5 %. among these, klebsiella  pneumoniae could be isolated in 29.8 %, enterobacter cloacae in 12.8 %, enterobacter aerogenes in 8.5 %, and escherichia coli in 6.4 % of late onset sepsis. majority of the strains showed a resistance to antibiotics used in empiric treatment. antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment from birth until the onset of late onset sepsis could be analyzed in 20 out of 27 newborns with late onset sepsis caused by enterobacteriaceae. a regimen of empirical antibiotic treatment  containing aminopenicillin and/or gentamicin was administered in 16 newborns and  that of cephalosporin in 14 out of 20 newborns for at least 5 days before onset of sepsis. conclusions: the association of empiric long-term antibiotic treatment and the high number of late onset sepsis with often multiresistant enterobacteriaceae might be causal and urges for a change in general antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment in newborns admitted to the neonatal care unit of our hospital.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacter spp. in patients with bacteremia in a tertiary hospital in southern brazil.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are increasingly prevalent  in enterobacter spp., posing a challenge to the treatment of infections caused by this microorganism. the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of inpatients with bacteremia caused by esbl and non esbl-producing enterobacter spp. in a tertiary hospital over the period 2004-2008. methods: the presence of blactx-m, blatem, blashv, and blaper genes was detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and nucleotide sequence analysis. genetic similarity between strains was defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: enterobacter spp. was identified in 205 of 4907 of the patients who had positive blood cultures during hospitalization. of those cases, 41 (20%) were esbl-producing enterobacter spp. nosocomial pneumonia  was the main source of bacteremia caused by esbl-producing enterobacter spp. the  presence of this microorganism was associated with longer hospital stays. the esbl genes detected were: ctx-m-2 (23), ctx-m-59 (10), ctx-m-15 (1), shv-12 (5),  and per-2 (2). while enterobacter aerogenes strains showed mainly a clonal profile, enterobacter cloacae strains were polyclonal. conclusion: although no difference in clinical outcomes was observed between patients with infections by  esbl-producing and non-esbl-producing strains, the detection of esbl in enterobacter spp. resulted in the change of antimicrobials in 75% of cases, having important implications in the decision-making regarding adequate antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == the outcome of treating esbl infections with carbapenems vs. non carbapenem antimicrobials.
AB  == background: in india where the prevalence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) producing organisms among gram negative organisms is 60-70% and ertapenem  was unavailable at the beginning of this study, exclusive use of group 2 carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) for treatment raises issues of cost and development of resistance. therefore the role of non-carbapenem alternatives, chiefly betalactam + betalactamase inhibitors (bl-bli) was explored in this prospective observational study at a private tertiary care teaching hospital. patients and methods: 522 consecutive in door patients from the period between june 2006 to march 2007and june 2008 to december 2008, who had true infections with esbl producing organisms were enrolled in the study. antimicrobials were prescribed or changed by the treating physicians on the basis of the nature and severity of infection, the susceptibility of the organism and the affordability of the patient. patients who received a carbapenem at any time during treatment were considered in the carbapenem group. those who never received a carbapenem at any time during treatment were considered in the non-carbapenem group. results: of the 522 infections, 287 were urinary tract infections, 60 were skin structure  infections, 60 were bacteremias, 55 were hospital acquired pneumonias, 31 were intra-abdominal infections and 29 were other infections. there were 351 e. coli,  119 k. pneumoniae, 23 k. oxytoca, 16 enterobacter aerogenes, 5 kozoanae, 4 enterobacter agglomerans, 3 citrobacter freundi, 1 e. cloacae, 1 enterobacterspp. and 1 morgenella morganii isolates. clinical outcomes were available for 486 patients. 339 patients who were in the non-carbapenem group and who might have had less serious infections had a clinical success rate of 79.6%. 147 patients who were in the carbapenem group and who might have had more serious infections had a clinical success rate of 85.71%. conclusions: it is possible to successfully treat at least the less serious infections due to esbl producing gram negative organisms with non-carbapenem antimicrobials. this will not compromise outcomes but will likely result in restricting the use of carbapenems  which may help preserve their efficacy against increasingly resistant organisms.

TI  == genetic characterization of tigecycline resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == objectives: the intrinsically encoded rama gene has been linked to tigecycline resistance through the up-regulation of efflux pump acrab in enterobacter cloacae. the molecular basis for increased rama expression in e. cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes, as well as the role of arac regulator rara, has not yet been shown. to ascertain the intrinsic molecular mechanism(s) involved in tigecycline resistance in enterobacter spp., we analysed the expression levels of rama and rara and corresponding efflux pump genes acrab and oqxab in enterobacter spp. clinical isolates. methods: the expression levels of rama, rara, oqxa and acra were tested by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. the ramr open reading frames of the rama-overexpressing strains were sequenced; strains harbouring mutations were transformed with wild-type ramr to study altered rama expression and tigecycline susceptibility. results: tigecycline resistance was mediated primarily by increased rama expression in e. cloacae and e. aerogenes. only the rama-overexpressing e. cloacae isolates showed increased rara and oqxa expression. upon complementation with wild-type ramr, all enterobacter spp. containing ramr mutations exhibited decreased rama and acra expression and increased tigecycline susceptibility. exceptions were one e. cloacae strain and one e. aerogenes strain, where a decrease in rama levels was not accompanied by lower acra expression. conclusions: increased rama expression due to ramr deregulation is the primary mediator of tigecycline resistance in clinical isolates of e. cloacae and e. aerogenes. however, some rama-overexpressing isolates do not show changes in ramr, suggesting alternate pathways of rama regulation; the rara regulator and the oqxab efflux pump may also play a role in  tigecycline resistance in e. cloacae.

AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and qnr determinants in enterobacter species from japan.
AB  == the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) has been increasing worldwide, but screening criteria for detection of esbls are not standardized for ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae such as enterobacter species. in this study, we investigated the prevalence of esbls and/or ampc beta-lactamases in japanese clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. and the association of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) determinants with esbl producers. a total of 364 clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. collected throughout japan between november 2009 and january 2010 were studied. esbl-producing strains were assessed by the clsi confirmatory test and the boronic acid disk test. pcr and sequencing  were performed to detect ctx-m, tem, and shv type esbls and pmqr determinants. for esbl-producing enterobacter spp., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was performed using xbai restriction enzyme. of the 364 isolates, 22 (6.0%) were esbl producers. seven isolates of enterobacter cloacae produced ctx-m-3, followed by two isolates producing shv-12. two isolates of enterobacter aerogenes produced ctx-m-2. of the 22 esbl producers, 21 had the ampc enzyme, and six met the criteria for esbl production in the boronic acid test. we found a significant association of qnrs with ctx-m-3-producing e. cloacae. the 11 esbl-producing enterobacter spp. possessing bla(ctx-m), bla(shv), or bla(tem) were divided into  six unique pfge types. this is the first report about the prevalence of qnr determinants among esbl-producing enterobacter spp. from japan. our results suggest that esbl-producing enterobacter spp. with qnr determinants are spreading in japan.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == isolation and characterization of plant growth promoting bacteria from non-rhizospheric soil and their effect on cowpea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp.) seedling growth.
AB  == the efficacy of four potential phosphate solubilizing enterobacter isolated from  non-rhizospheric soil in western ghat forest in india. plant growth promoting ability of these isolates was evaluated in cowpea. all are gram negative, rod shaped, 0.8-1.6 mm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature, grow from 5 to 40 degrees c (optimum temp. 28 +/- 2 degrees c). all isolates exhibits growth at a wide range of ph 6-12, optimum at ph 7.0 and tolerates up to 7% (w/v) salt concentration. 16s rrna gene sequencing reveals the confirmation of isolates to enterobacter aerogenes sp. (nii-0907 and nii-0929), enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae sp. (nii-0931) and enterobacter asburiae sp. (nii-0934) with which they share >99% sequence similarity. under in vitro conditions, all the four isolates  were found to produce indole acetic acid, p-solubilization and hydrogen cyanide.  the p-solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in ph of the medium (ph 7.0-<3.0). the plant growth promotion properties were demonstrated through a cow pea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp) based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. although the bacterial inoculation was found to result in significant increment in root, shoot and biomass and it stimulated bacterial counts in the rhizosphere. hence, these isolates can further formulated and used for field application.

TI  == cefditoren versus ceftazidime in inducer-substrate combinations for the evaluation of ampc production in a disc approximation test.
AB  == objective: to evaluate cefditoren in inducer-substrate combinations to screen for ampc induction. methods: 100 clinical isolates (25 p. aeruginosa, 25 e. cloacae,  14 m. morganii, 13 s. marcescens, 12 c. freundii, 7 p. rettgeri, and 4 e. aerogenes) were tested by the kirby-bauer disc approximation method using cefditoren and ceftazidime discs as substrates, and cefditoren and imipenem discs as inducers. results: none of the strains showed induction of ampc with cefditoren-ceftazidime as inducer-substrate combination. imipenem-cefditoren as inducer-substrate combination was not useful for evaluating strains of p. aeruginosa since no inhibition zones surrounding the cefditoren disc were found.  among evaluable enterobacteria (those showing substrate inhibition zone), inducible amp c was detected in 48 out of 63 (76.2%) with cefditoren, and in 33 out of 68 (48.5%) isolates with ceftazidime as substrate. significantly (p=0.013) higher number of ampc producers were detected with cefditoren versus ceftazidime  (76.2% vs. 48.5%), due to the differences found for e. cloacae (72.8% vs. 21.7%;  p=0.0009) and s. marcescens (100% vs. 54.5%; p=0.03). higher mean reductions of diameters around substrate discs were found for cefditoren (4.17 mm) vs. ceftazidime (3.79 mm), reaching statistical significance (p<0.05) for indol-positive proteae: m. morganii (5.32 mm vs. 3.92 mm) and p. rettgeri (3.47 mm vs. 2.64 mm). conclusion: cefditoren showed no induction capability, and when  used as substrate (with imipenem as inducer) it offered detection rates of ampc inducible enterobacteria higher than the imipenem-ceftazidime combination, mainly for enterobacter spp. and serratia spp., with higher diameter reductions for indol-positive proteae.

TI  == [clinical assessment of novel chromid esbl agar plates for detection of esbl producers in the family enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers in the family enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. chromid esbl agar newly developed for screening esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae was released in japan in april, 2007. we evaluated the clinical assessment of chromid esbl agar in routine microbiology laboratory. the 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae with the mics of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. the 27 esbl-producers examined were comprising of 19 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 citrobacter freundii, 3 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 s. marcescens (esbl group) and 20 esbl non-producers  consiating of 5 k. oxytoca, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 p. vlugaris, 2 serratia marcescens, 8 c. freundii, 2 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 e. aerogenes (non-esbl group). characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. as the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of chromid esbl agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. it should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. these findings clearly suggested that in  cases of utilizing chromid esbl agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the esbl-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to cpdx.

TI  == efflux pumps are involved in the defense of gram-negative bacteria against the natural products isobavachalcone and diospyrone.
AB  == the activities of two naturally occurring compounds, isobavachalcone and diospyrone, against documented strains and multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacterial isolates were evaluated. the results indicated that the two compounds exhibited intrinsic antibacterial activity against several gram-negative bacteria, and their activities were significantly improved in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor (mic values decreased to below 10 microg/ml). in addition, the activities of isobavachalcone and diospyrone against various strains exhibiting deletions of the major efflux pump components (acrab,  tolc) were significantly increased. the overall results indicate that isobavachalcone and diospyrone could be candidates for the development of new drugs against mdr strains and that their use in combination with efflux pump inhibitors reinforces their activity.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == effects of an alternative cefepime dosing strategy in pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter spp, citrobacter freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa: a single-center, open-label, prospective, observational study.
AB  == background: various dosing strategies for cefepime have been developed in an effort to maximize pharmacodynamic exposure of this agent against gram-negative infections. an assessment of cefepime dosing strategies is warranted given recent reports of poorer treatment outcomes associated with cefepime compared with other antibiotics, particularly in patients infected with gram-negative organisms with  elevated mics. objectives: the aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of cefepime iv at a dose of 1 g q8h (adjusted based on renal function) with those of other appropriate antimicrobials in the treatment of gramnegative pulmonary and bloodstream infections and to identify risk factors for treatment failure. methods: this single-center, open-label, prospective, observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center (barnes-jewish hospital, st. louis, missouri). isolates from infections in adult patients with bacteremia or pulmonary infection caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, or citrobacter freundii were assessed in a noninterventional manner. infections were identified using an electronic notification system. patients receiving appropriate monotherapy against the studied isolate within 24 hours of culture attainment were stratified into 1 of 3 cohorts according to treatment outcome, as follows: treatment success (resolution of initial fever or elevated white blood cell count to normal values plus the presence of repeat negative cultures from the initial site or below the quantitative definition for infection), improvement (treatment success without repeat negative cultures), or treatment failure (persistent or repeat positive cultures for the original organism at the infected site despite appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy, lack of resolution in fever or leukocytosis, switch to an alternative antibiotic, or the addition of another antibiotic with gram-negative coverage after > or =3 days of the initial regimen, relapse of infection within 14 days, or mortality attributable to the index infection). multivariate regression analysis was used to examine risk factors associated with treatment failure. results: data from 120 patients (56.7% male; mean age, 62.2 years) were analyzed. treatment failure occurred in 48.6% (36/74) of patients who received cefepime versus 32.6% (15/46) of those who received other antibiotics; this difference was not statistically significant. the proportion of patients with markers of increased severity of illness (intensive care unit [p = 0.005] and mechanical ventilation [p = 0.002]) was significantly greater in the cefepime group compared with the group that received other antibiotics. multivariate logistic regression identified infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 1.40 [95% ci, 1.01-2.00]) and mechanical ventilation (aor, 7.08 [95% ci, 1.80-31.3]) as being associated with treatment failure in patients who received cefepime. mechanical ventilation (aor, 3.97 [95% ci, 1.47-11.1]) and neutropenia (aor, 5.26 [95% ci, 1.28-20.0]) were independent predictors of treatment failure among all patients studied. conclusions: based on these results in this small cohort, the efficacy of this cefepime dosing strategy (1 g q8h) appeared to be similar to that of other antimicrobials.

AB  == acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and  resistant pathogens, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. total and individual isothiocyanate (itc) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of r. sativus were also evaluated. both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. of the different parts of r. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different itcs such as allyl isothiocyanate (aitc), phenyl isothiocyanate (pitc), benzyl isothiocyanate (bitc), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (mtbitc) in different parts of the plant. the low linear correlation between the total itc content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of r. sativus was not dependent on the total itc content. however, the antibacterial activity of r. sativus was well correlated with aitc, pitc, and bitc for all organisms except for enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to mtbitc.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  == five thiourea derivative ligands and their ni(2+) and cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. the compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (esherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (candida albicans, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis). the  minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. in vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. the effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  == purpose: the influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. methods: hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. to account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. results: susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82  u.s. hospitals. two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (escherichia coli). extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (e. aerogenes and e. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (e. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). there were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusion: use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == clinical experience of serious infections caused by enterobacteriaceae producing  vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in a greek university hospital.
AB  == background: the dissemination of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) in members of the family enterobacteriaceae is regarded as an emerging clinical threat. the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to mbl-producing isolates were analyzed. methods: during a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an mbl-producing strain  belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. we screened for mbl production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. results: fourteen cases of bacteremia and  3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an mbl-producing isolate were studied. most of the patients had previously been colonized with an mbl-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. the isolated pathogens (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to >32 microg/ml) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(vim-1) cluster in all isolates. among the 12 k. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have  failed. twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. the attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. conclusions: mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the mic of carbapenems. colonization with an mbl-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria.

TI  == molecular and descriptive epidemiologyof multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae in hospitalized infants.
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae (mdre) in hospitalized infants. methods: from 2000 through 2005, active surveillance cultures for mdre were performed for patients admitted  to a 40-bed neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) that provides care for critically ill infants 6 months of age or younger. mdre epidemiology and the genetic relatedness of mdre strains determined by repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. results: active surveillance cultures revealed that 759 (23%) of 3,370 nicu infants (or approximately 1 in 5) developed mdre colonization or infection and that 613 (72%) of the 853 isolates with epidemiologic data available were healthcare acquired. mdre colonization occurred more frequently (in 653 infants [86%]) than did mdre infection (in 106 [14%]). of the 653 infants with mdre colonization, 119 (18%) eventually became infected, with 29 (4%) acquiring sterile site infections. the most commonly isolated organisms were the  enterobacter species, accounting for 612 (71%) of the 862 isolates. molecular epidemiologic analysis revealed that genetic-relatedness clustering (related clusters defined as having a genetic similarity coefficient greater than 95%) varied depending on microbial species. clustering was detected for 36 (78%) of the 46 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 22 (45%) of the 49 enterobacter cloacae isolates, and 13 (59%) of the 22 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. conclusion: hospitalized infants are at significant risk of acquiring mdre, specifically enterobacter species, at the study institution. active surveillance cultures identified colonized patients who likely contributed to the institutional reservoir of mdre. molecular epidemiologic studies suggest that both patient-to-patient transmission and de novo acquisition of resistance play a role in the acquisition of these organisms, and that the clinical significance of such acquisition varies by species. the high percentage of e. aerogenes isolates that  demonstrated genetic clustering suggests that monitoring the prevalence of this organism could serve as a useful measure of compliance with infection control procedures.

TI  == carbapenemases: molecular diversity and clinical consequences.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze most beta-lactams including carbapenems. carbapenemases are classified in four molecular classes; those belonging to class a are the chromosomally-encoded and clavulanic acid-inhibited  imi, nmc-a and sme, identified in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens; the plasmid-encoded kpc enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae (and rarely in pseudomonas aeruginosa); and the ges-type enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. the class b enzymes are the most clinically-significant carbapenemases; they are metallo-beta-lactamases, mostly of the imp and the vim series. they have been reported worldwide and their genes  are plasmid- and integron-located, hydrolyzing all beta-lactams with the exception of aztreonam. one single plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, cmy-10,  identified in an enterobacter aerogenes isolate, has been shown to be a cephaslosporinase with some carbapenemase properties. finally, the class d carbapenemases are being increasingly reported, mostly in acinetobacter baumannii, and they compromise the efficacy of imipenem and meropenem significantly.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the prevalence of qnr determinants, their influence on quinolone susceptibility and their association with other plasmid-mediated genes  in ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae without any selection criteria. methods: a total of 644 consecutive, non-duplicate isolates of enterobacter cloacae (186), enterobacter aerogenes (154), citrobacter freundii (138) and serratia marcescens  (166) were examined. we performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing and pcr for qnr determinants (qnra, qnrb and qnrs), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) (bla(tem), bla(shv) and bla(ctx-m)), orf513, orf1005 and bla(dha-1.) to differentiate qnr subtypes, restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing was performed. results: the prevalence of qnr determinants was high in c. freundii (38.4%) and e. cloacae (28.5%), but low in e. aerogenes (3.2%) and s. marcescens  (2.4%). qnra1 was most frequent in e. cloacae, and qnrb was prevalent in c. freundii. all the qnra- and qnrb4-positive isolates showed ciprofloxacin mics > or = 0.5 mg/l and nalidixic acid mics > or = 16 mg/l. however, the b1 and b2 subtypes showed a wide range of quinolone mics. in relation to esbls, we found that qnra1, qnrb2 and qnrb4 producers were significantly more frequent among esbl producers (p < 0.05). twelve of 13 qnrb4 producers harboured bla(dha-1). orf513 was detected in 43 isolates of the 47 isolates with co-resident qnr and esbl genes. none of the qnr producers harboured orf1005. conclusions: the prevalence of qnra and qnrb was high among c. freundii and e. cloacae in korea and there were characteristics unique to the qnr subtypes. quinolones should be used cautiously in these species, especially when they are esbl producers.

TI  == cloning, nucleotide sequencing, and analysis of the acrab-tolc efflux pump of enterobacter cloacae and determination of its involvement in antibiotic resistance in a clinical isolate.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae is an emerging clinical pathogen that may be responsible for nosocomial infections. management of these infections is often difficult, owing to the high frequency of strains that are resistant to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents in the clinical setting. multidrug efflux pumps, especially  those belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division family, play a major role as a mechanism of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative pathogens. in the present study, we cloned and sequenced the genes encoding an acracb-tolc-like efflux pump from an e. cloacae clinical isolate (isolate ecdc64) showing a broad  antibiotic resistance profile. sequence analysis showed that the acrr, acra, acrb, and tolc genes encode proteins that display 79.8%, 84%, 88%, and 82% amino  acid identities with the respective homologues of enterobacter aerogenes and are  arranged in a similar pattern. deletion of the acra gene to yield an acra-deficient ecdc64 mutant (ecdeltaacra) showed the involvement of acrab-tolc in multidrug resistance in e. cloacae. however, experiments with an efflux pump inhibitor suggested that additional efflux systems also play a role in antibiotic resistance. investigation of several unrelated isolates of e. cloacae by pcr analysis revealed that the acrab system is apparently ubiquitous in this species.

TI  == evaluation of phoenix automated microbiology system for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among chromosomal ampc-producing enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == we evaluated the bd phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) detection test among chromosomal ampc-producing enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens. the study was conducted on 72 non-repetitive esbl producers (33 e. cloacae, 13 e. aerogenes, 14 c. freundii, and 12 s. marcescens) and 77 esbl non-producers (33 e. cloacae, 9 e. aerogenes, 6 c. freundii, and 29 s. marcescens). the organisms were selected as suspected esbl-producers based on the double disk synergy test and confirmed by pcr amplification of blatem-1, blashv-1, blactx-m-1, blactx-m-2, and blactx-m-9.  the phoenix esbl test, using a 5-well confirmatory test and the bdxpert system, was evaluated. of the 72 isolates identified as esbl-producers based on the ddst, 46 isolates harbored ctx-m-type enzymes, 21 harbored tem type enzymes, and 31 harbored shv enzymes. the phoenix system identified esbl only in 15 isolates. of  the 77 esbl non-producers, ths phoenix system identified esbl in 4 isolates, 3 of which were confirmed to be esbl-producers. in this study, the phoenix system was  highly specific (76/77, 98.7%), and it identified 3 additional esbl-producers that were not detected by ddst. however, the phoenix system's sensitivity was very low (15/72, 20.8%). considering the increasing prevalence of esbl production among ampc-producers, the bd phoenix system could not be considered a reliable stand-alone esbl detection method for the strains tested in our study.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == predictors of in-hospital mortality for bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter species or citrobacter freundii.
AB  == study objective: to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with bacteremia caused by enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, or citrobacter freundii. design: retrospective cohort study. setting: 1300-bed tertiary academic medical center. patients: one hundred twenty-four patients who  had bloodstream infections caused by e. cloacae (3), e. aerogenes (71), or c. freundii (50) between 1998 and 2004. measurements and main results: data from patients with bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter sp or c. freundii were retrospectively segregated according to hospital survival (98 survivors, 26  nonsurvivors). multiple patient characteristics and processes of care were evaluated to identify factors contributing to in-hospital mortality. multiple logistic regression was performed based on univariate comparisons to determine independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. among the 124 cases of bacteremia, the crude in-hospital mortality rate was 21% (26 cases). univariate analysis revealed that survivors were more likely to receive an aminoglycoside as part of their empiric antimicrobial regimen (40% [39/98]) compared with nonsurvivors (19% [5/26], p=0.05). other factors related to antimicrobial therapy including choice and number of agents used did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (p>0.05). vasopressor use (31% [30/98] vs 62% [16/26]), care in an intensive care unit (19% [19/98] vs 54% [14/26]), and acute renal failure (13% [13/98] vs 31% [8/26]) occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors (p<0.05). multiple logistic regression identified resistance to second- or third-generation cephalosporins (adjusted odds ratio [or] 5.16, 95% confidence interval [ci] 2.66-10.0, p=0.013), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance (adjusted or 5.44,  95% ci 2.53-11.7, p=0.027), and mechanical ventilation (adjusted or 12.2, 95% ci  5.99-24.5, p<0.001) as independent determinants of mortality. conclusion: among patients with enterobacter sp or c. freundii bloodstream infections, those with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant or second or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains or those who required mechanical ventilation had  an increased risk of mortality.

TI  == emergence of arma and rmtb aminoglycoside resistance 16s rrna methylases in belgium.
AB  == objectives: 16s rrna methylase-mediated high-level resistance to aminoglycosides  has been reported recently in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli only from a limited number of countries. this study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of this type of resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae  from two belgian hospitals and the characteristics of the strains. methods: we screened for high-level gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae consecutively collected between 2000 and  2005 at two laboratories by pcr for the arma, rmta and rmtb 16s rrna methylase genes. the beta-lactamase presence in the strains was also determined by phenotypic and genotypic methods. results: overall arma genes were detected in 18 klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter amalonaticus whereas rmtb was detected in a single e. coli isolate. the rmta gene was not found. all 16s rrna methylase-bearing strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), predominantly type ctx-m-3, as well as various types of beta-lactamases. in the majority of the strains, the  arma gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of the incl/m incompatibility group whereas rmtb was borne by an incfi plasmid. conclusions: this is the first report of the emergence of 16s rrna methylases in enterobacteriaceae in belgium. the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates producing both esbls and 16s rrna methylases raises clinical concern and may become a major therapeutic threat in the future.

AB  == nine novel lexitropsins were synthesized by linking two netropsin-like moieties through three different dicarboxylic acids; 9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenedicarboxylic acid; [(3-[[(carboxymethyl)amino]carbonyl]benzoyl)amino]acetic acid and indole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. the netropsin residues were modified by the use of  n-isopentylpyrrole, 5-methylthiophene or 5-isopropylthiazole heterocyclic building blocks in place of the usual n-methylpyrrole. the compounds were tested  against five gram-positive bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, streptomyces faecalis, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, mycobacterium fortuitum, three gram-negative bacteria: klebsiella aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and three fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and aspergillus nidulans. some of the compounds showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of the microorganisms.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == sanitary and bacteriological aspects of sewage treatment.
AB  == a study into the removal of contamination load and indicator bacteria was carried out in 1992-1996 in the mechanical, biological and chemical waste-water treatment plant wtp in lezany, in the county of reszel, in the province of warmia and mazury in poland. the results of chemical analyses found a high efficiency of removal of carbon compounds, cod (90%) and bod (98%), in the process of purification of household sewage. in addition, a high effectiveness of total nitrogen, on average 71%, and unsatisfactory removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were found. the results of microbiological analyses confirmed the high efficiency of removal of indicator bacteria in the process of  sewage treatment from 94 to 97%. in the sewage after the final phase of purification in stabilization ponds, the following pathogenic bacteria were identified with the use of the epl 21tests: escherichia coli, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter georgoriae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pnemoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, ervinia herbicola, edwardsiella tarda, serratia odoriefra, serratia marcescens, providencia alcalifaciens, hafnia alvei, yersina pestis, yersina pseudotuberculosis, yersinia fredericksenii, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, aeromons hydrophila, pseudomonas aerulginosa. the obtained results show that although the sewage purification system is efficient and reduces the contamination load to the level required by the regulations (ministry of environmental protection, natural resources and forestry from 20 september 1991)  and removes a great percentage of indicator bacteria, the purified sewage may be  a source of pathogenic bacteria in inland waters.

TI  == are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. methods: all patients admitted to a  31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. results: of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. the lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. the main resistant microorganisms were enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),  and enterobacter cloacae. the main susceptible microorganisms were enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible s. aureus (mssa), and proteus mirabilis. patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). the maximum degrees of organ failure during the icu stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant  organisms. conclusions: infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is  not an independent predictor for death. the development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the icu length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge).
AB  == we attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (uti) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for uti, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). we examined eight species of bacteria ( enterococcus avium, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated uti. it was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. the chromosomal dna of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in pfge. a comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. these results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by pfge is a more effective method  for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == impact of previous use of antibiotics on development of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in patients with enterobacter bacteremia.
AB  == this retrospective study was conducted to determine the risk factors for resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (escs) and to examine the influence of previous use of an aminoglycoside with an esc on resistance to escs  in patients with enterobacter bacteremia from january 1991 through december 2000. a total of 423 episodes of enterobacter bacteremia among 414 patients were documented during the 10-year study period. three hundred thirty-two (78%) isolates were enterobacter cloacae, 72 (17%) enterobacter aerogenes, and 19 (4%)  other enterobacter species. causative isolates exhibited resistance to escs in 225 episodes and susceptibility in 198 episodes. nosocomial acquisition was an independent risk factor for resistance to escs (odds ratio [or], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [95%ci], 1.7-6.8). the median number of antibiotics used was  significantly greater in cases caused by resistant isolates than in cases caused  by susceptible isolates (or, 1.8; 95%ci, 1.2-2.6). resistance to escs was associated with previous use of any esc (or, 5.0; 95%ci, 2.5-10.2). the proportion of resistant episodes in patients treated previously with an aminoglycoside plus an esc was not different from that in patients treated with an esc alone. in conclusion, previous use of escs was associated with resistance  to escs in patients with enterobacter bacteremia; moreover, previous use of an aminoglycoside with an esc did not significantly decrease the risk of resistance  to escs.

TI  == prba, a gene coding for an esterase hydrolyzing parabens in enterobacter cloacae  and enterobacter gergoviae strains.
AB  == the new gene prba encodes an esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of parabens in enterobacter cloacae strain em. this gene is located on the chromosome of strain em and was cloned by several pcr approaches. the prba gene codes for an immature protein of 533 amino acids, the first 31 of which represent a proposed signal peptide yielding a mature protein of a putative molecular mass  of 54.6 kda. this enzyme presents analogies with other type b carboxylesterases,  mainly of eukaryotic origin. the cloning and expression of the prba gene in a strain of escherichia coli previously unable to hydrolyze parabens resulted in the acquisition of a hydrolytic capacity comparable to the original activity of strain em, along with an increased resistance of the transformed strain to methyl paraben. the presence of homologues of prba was tested in additional ubiquitous bacteria, which may be causative factors in opportunistic infections, including enterobacter gergoviae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas agglomerans, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and burkholderia cepacia. among the 41 total strains tested, 2 strains of e. gergoviae and 1 strain of burkholderia cepacia were able  to degrade almost completely 800 mg of methyl paraben liter(-1). two strains of e. gergoviae, named g1 and g12, contained a gene that showed high homology to the prba gene of e. cloacae and demonstrated comparable paraben esterase activities.  the significant geographical distance between the locations of the isolated e. cloacae and e. gergoviae strains suggests the possibility of an efficient transfer mechanism of the prba gene, conferring additional resistance to parabens in ubiquitous bacteria that represent a common source of opportunistic infections.

TI  == method for estimation of low outer membrane permeability to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria plays a major role in beta-lactam resistance as it slows down antibiotic entry into the periplasm and therefore acts in synergy with beta-lactamases and efflux systems. up to now, the quantitative estimation of low outer membrane permeability by the method of zimmermann and rosselet was difficult because of the secreted and cell surface-associated beta-lactamases. the method presented here uses the acylation  of a highly sensitive periplasmic penicillin-binding protein (pbp) (blar-ctd) to  assess the rate of beta-lactam penetration into the periplasm. the method is dedicated to measurement of low permeability and is only valid when the diffusion rate through the outer membrane is rate limiting. cytoplasmic membrane associated pbps do not interfere since they are acylated after the very sensitive blar-ctd.  this method was used to measure the permeability of beta-lactamase-deficient strains of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, and cephacetrile. except for that of cephacetrile, the permeability coefficients were equal to or below 10(-7) cm/s. for cephacetrile, carbenicillin, and benzylpenicillin, the outer membrane of e. cloacae was 20 to 60 times less permeable than that of escherichia coli, whereas for cefotaxime, aztreonam, and ampicillin it was, respectively, 400, 1,000, and 700 times less permeable. the permeability coefficient for aztreonam is the lowest ever measured (p = 3.2 x 10(-9) cm/s). using these values, the mics for a beta-lactamase-overproducing strain of e. cloacae were successfully predicted, demonstrating the validity of the method.

TI  == but-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class c beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of buttiauxella sp.
AB  == an atypical enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in tenon hospital (paris, france) from a patient's skull wound infection. identifications by the api-50che biochemical system and 16s rrna gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the buttiauxella genus. the bla gene was cloned and sequenced. the deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (but-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli. the isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of but-1 were comparable with results described for other ambler class c enzymes. bla(but-1) and the associated ampr transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region,  a genetic organization already described for other inducible class c beta-lactamases. the deduced amino acid sequence of ampr shared 85% and 81% identity with ampr from e. cloacae and c. freundii respectively.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == development of a sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting and quantifying cmy-2 and shv beta-lactamases.
AB  == polyclonal rabbit antibodies against shv-1 and cmy-2 beta-lactamases were produced and characterized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were  developed. immunoblots revealed that the anti-shv-1 antibody recognized shv-1 but did not recognize tem-1, k-1, oxa-1, or any ampc beta-lactamase tested. the anti-cmy-2 antibody detected escherichia coli cmy-2, enterobacter cloacae p99, klebsiella pneumoniae act-1, and the ampc beta-lactamases of enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii, and citrobacter freundii. no cross-reactivity of  the anti-cmy-2 antibody was seen against laboratory strains of e. coli possessing tem-1, shv-1, k-1, or oxa-1 beta-lactamases. operating conditions for performing  elisas were optimized. both anti-cmy-2 and anti-shv-1 antibodies detected picogram quantities of purified protein in elisas. the reactivity of the anti-cmy-2 antibody was tested against a number of ampc beta-lactamases by assaying known quantities of purified enzymes in elisas (ampc beta-lactamases of  m. morganii, c. freundii, e. coli, and e. cloacae). as the homology to cmy-2 beta-lactamase decreased, the minimum level needed for detection increased (e.g., 94% homology recognized at 1 ng/ml and 71% homology recognized at 10 ng/ml). the  elisas were used to assay unknown clinical isolates for ampc and shv beta-lactamases, and the results were confirmed with pcr amplification of bla(ampc) and bla(shv) genes. overall, we found that our elisas were at least 95% sensitive and specific for detecting shv and ampc beta-lactamases. the elisa format can facilitate the identification of ampc and shv beta-lactamases and can  be used to quantify relative amounts of beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical and laboratory isolates.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

AB  == objective: to isolate and identify microorganisms from cockroaches that were captured in a public hospital and to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of these microorganisms. methods: cockroaches were captured in the morning and at night. they were placed in flasks rinsed with 70% alcohol, transferred to sterilized flasks, and then taken to the laboratory. only cockroaches captured whole and live were utilized for the study. after being immobilized at 0 degree c, each cockroach was placed in a test tube with sterile saline solution (0.8%) and then homogenized. the resulting solution was then placed in the following five culture media: macconkey agar, nutrient broth, brain-heart infusion agar, sabouraud agar, and mannitol. the cultures were examined using a stereomicroscope, and colony-forming units were counted. the disk diffusion test  was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. results: we found a 56% prevalence of enterobacteria and an 18% prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci. fifteen species of enterobacteria were identified. the most frequent were klebsiella pneumoniae (17%), enterobacter aerogenes (14%), serratia marcescens (13%), hafnia alvei (12%), enterobacter gergoviae and enterobacter cloacae (each 9%), and serratia spp. (6%). both the enterobacteria and the coagulase-negative staphylococci showed significant resistance to antimicrobials, including oxacillin. conclusions: the prevalence of enteropathogenic bacteria and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from periplaneta americana cockroaches  in the studied hospital reflects the weakness of the measures adopted both for vector control and for antimicrobial use. the results show the need to implement  effective health-institution programs focusing on hygiene and the rational use of antimicrobials.

AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and of  staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the italian epidemiological observatory survey sponsored by the smith-kline foundation. a standardised method was used to determine the mics of 22 antibiotics against isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), escherichia coli (n=684), enterobacter cloacae (n=342), enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the mics of 11 antibiotics against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). overall, the susceptibility rate of enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). during the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. in contrast, enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. of the total number of staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed  a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). rates of susceptibility of particular species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains  from different geographical areas of italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [icu] inpatients, non-icu inpatients). susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central italy. the susceptibility of escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. no significant differences in susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae or escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to icu and non-icu units. the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was higher in icu inpatients (52%) than in non-icu inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.

TI  == h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  == in an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. in the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed mrsa, burkholderia cepacia, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans were resistant. the activity was induced only by h(2)o(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. the mean concentration of h(2)o(2) produced  by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microl of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. viridans group streptococci inhibited mrsa growth in saliva as well as in culture media. these results indicate that h(2)o(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit mrsa colonization of oral cavities in newborns.

AB  == to estimate the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in brazil, 18 strains from different species of the family enterobacteriaceae exhibiting a positive double-disk synergy test were collected by a clinical laboratory from several hospitals in rio de janeiro, brazil, in 1996 and 1997. four strains (proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter amalonaticus) hybridized with a 550-bp ctx-m probe. the p. mirabilis strain produced a ctx-m-2 enzyme. the e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and c. amalonaticus isolates harbored a bla gene which was identified by cloning and sequencing as a  bla(ctx-m) gene. e. coli hb101 transconjugants and the e. coli dh5alpha transformant harboring a recombinant plasmid produced a ctx-m beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 7.6 conferring a resistance phenotype characterized by a  higher level of resistance to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime, as observed with the other ctx-m enzymes. the deduced protein sequence showed a novel ambler class a ctx-m enzyme, named ctx-m-8, which had 83 to 88% identity with the previously described ctx-m enzymes. the phylogenic study of the ctx-m family including ctx-m-8 revealed four ctx-m types, ctx-m-8 being the first member of a new phylum of ctx-m enzymes. the evolutionary distances between the four types of ctx-m were large, suggesting that the four clusters branched off early from a distant unknown enzyme and that intermediate enzymes probably existed.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in a consecutive collection of clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. the abilities of various screening methods to detect esbls in enterobacters were simultaneously tested. among the 68 consecutive isolates (56 enterobacter cloacae and 12 enterobacter aerogenes isolates) that were analyzed for beta-lactamase content, 21 (25 and 58%, respectively) possessed transferable esbls with pis of 8.2 and phenotypic characteristics of shv-type enzymes, 8 (14.3%) of the e. cloacae isolates produced a previously nondescribed, clavulanate-susceptible esbl that exhibited a pi of 6.9 and that conferred a ceftazidime resistance phenotype on escherichia coli transconjugants, and 2 e. cloacae isolates produced both of these enzymes. among the total of 31 isolates that were considered esbl producers, the vitek esbl detection test was positive for 2 (6.5%) strains, and the conventional double-disk synergy test (ddst) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and with expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam was positive for 5 (16%) strains.  modifications of the ddst consisting of closer application of the disks (at 20 instead of 30 mm), the use of cefepime, and the use of both modifications increased the sensitivity of this test to 71, 61, and 90%, respectively. of the 37 isolates for which isoelectric focusing failed to determine esbls, the vitek test was false positive for 1 isolate and the various forms of ddsts were false-positive for 3 isolates.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == thirty cases of enterobacter aerogenes or enterobacter cloacae septicemia diagnosed over a 32-month period in a tertiary care neonatal unit were enrolled in a case-control study. each case patient was matched with two controls (patients occupying the cots nearest the case patient when the latter developed septicemia). of the 32 perinatal characteristics evaluated, 11 were identified by univariate analysis to be significantly associated with the infection. these included parents being residents of the vietnamese refugee camps, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, umbilical arterial catheterization, umbilical venous catheterization, bladder catheterization, mechanical ventilation, antibiotic treatment, peripheral venous catheterization, nasogastric intubation, and parenteral nutrition. multivariate analysis, however, showed that preceding bladder catheterization and ongoing parenteral nutrition were the only  independent risk factors for enterobacter septicemia. strict aseptic technique in the preparation of parenteral nutrition fluid and avoidance of bladder catheterization are measures that may reduce the risk of enterobacter sepsis for  newborns.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == [bacteremia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with and without therapeutic procedure: frequency, associated factors and clinical significance].
AB  == purpose: to determine the frequency, associate factors and clinical features of bacteremia in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  (ercp), with or without therapeutic procedures. methods: prospectively, 42 consecutives patients undergoing 46 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ercps) from august to december 1994 were analyzed. the search for bacteremia was done by drawing 6 blood samples for cultures from peripheral blood. two blood samples were collected before the ercp and 4 of them  after. the bottles used for cultures were bactec bottles. the bottles were incubated in the bactec 9240 system, and eventual bacteria detect were identificated by the manual routine of the laboratory and also with the autoscan/microscan system. results: all blood cultures obtained before the ercps  were negatives. bacteremia were detected after 7 endoscopic procedures. in two episodes of bacteremia, the microorganism identified (staphylococcus epidermidis) was considered to be a contaminant. the other 5 episodes of bacteremia were considered true bacteremia (frequency- 10.9%), and the microorganisms identified  were: streptococcus viridans, corynebacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, klebsiello oxytoca and enterobacter aerogenes. this episodes were more frequent in the blood cultures obtained immediately after the ercps (p < 0.05), and occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics (p = 0.0192). clinical manifestation of the episodes of bacteremia were not detected.  conclusion: the episodes of bacteremia occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics, were transient and completely no symptomatic.

TI  == chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a clinical strain of proteus mirabilis (cf09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (mic >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated mic of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. two  beta-lactamases with apparent pis of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an ampc-type beta-lactamase with a pi of 9.0. amplification by pcr with primers for  ampc genes (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii) of  a 756-bp dna fragment from strain cf09 was obtained only with c. freundii-specific primers. hybridization results showed that the ampc gene is only chromosomally located while the tem gene is plasmid located. after cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that  this ampc gene is close to blacmy-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions glu --> gly at position 22, trp --> arg at position 201, and ser --> asn at position 343. ampc beta-lactamases derived from that of c. freundii (lat-1, lat-2, bil-1, and cmy-2) have been found in klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, and enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. this is the first example of a chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase observed in p. mirabilis. we suggest that it be  designated cmy-3.

TI  == [occurrence and susceptibility of hospital strains producing enzymes with a wide  spectrum of substrate profiles].
AB  == in connection with more and more frequent occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases an effort has been made to detect their presence in the biological materials coming from the patients of different wards of mining hospital in sosnowiec from january to september 1995. among 38 diagnostic materials, from which the strains in question were isolated, the following materials have been examined: bronchial lavage (52.6%), surgical wounds (18.4%),  urines (15.8%) and others (13.2%). the examined diagnostic materials came from intensive care unit (87.0%), casualty and orthopaedic surgery clinic (5.0%) and general surgery clinic (3.0%). the most frequently isolated microorganisms were klebsiella pneumoniae. (47.4%), serratia marcescens (36.8%), enterobacter cloacae (10.5%) and others (5.3%). half of the examined strains constituted those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and probably possessing an extra resistance mechanism: (serratia marcescens--74%, enterobacter cloacae--21%, enterobacter aerogenes--5.0%) and 50% were those producing extended--spectrum beta-lactamases. (klebsiella pneumoniae--95%, escherichia coli--5%). susceptibility of the examined strains to anti-microbial antibiotics was diverse. full susceptibility of the analysed strains has been observed exclusively in case of karbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and cefamycyn). in case of beta-lactamase with beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations susceptibility was diverse and dependent on the species of the examined microorganism.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == molecular epidemiology of acquisition of ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli in a nonoutbreak setting.
AB  == we prospectively studied the acquisition of ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (caz-rgn) in two surgical intensive care units (sicu) during a nonoutbreak period. surveillance cultures were obtained from patients at the time of admission and serially thereafter. caz-rgn isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). three hundred and forty-three patients were enrolled  from whom 1,621 baseline and follow-up cultures were obtained. the most common species isolated from patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22), enterobacter cloacae (21), acinetobacter spp. (13), enterobacter aerogenes (11), citrobacter spp. (10), pseudomonas spp. (non p. aeruginosa) (9), and stenotrophomonas spp. (7). for each species, pfge strain types were highly diverse; no single type was  recovered from more than four patients. twenty-eight patients acquired a caz-rgn  during the sicu stay; in six (21%), emergence of resistance from a previously susceptible strain was documented on the basis of matching serial strain types. transmission of caz-rgn between patients occurred but was infrequent, as judged by analyzing strain types of epidemiologically linked patients. in conclusion, colonization with caz-rgn in sicu was associated with diverse species and strains, as determined by molecular typing. emergence of resistance from previously susceptible strains appeared to be more important than horizontal transmission in acquisition of caz-rgn in a nonoutbreak period.

TI  == inducible amp c beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli from blood stream  infections: frequency, antimicrobial susceptibility, and molecular epidemiology in a national surveillance program (scope).
AB  == a surveillance study of nosocomial blood stream infections [surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiologic importance (scope)] was conducted during a  14-month period in 1995 to 1996 in approximately 50 american medical centers. among the 4725 blood stream infections, the etiologic agent was enterobacter spp. in 230, citrobacter freundii in 24, and serratia marcescens in 65. the vast majority of these isolates (89%) had been sent to the university of iowa including 198 enterobacter spp. (46 enterobacter aerogenes, 141 enterobacter cloacae, 11 other enterobacter spp.), 23 c. freundii, and 62 s. marcescens. because these species are capable of producing amp c beta-lactamase, we examined  their susceptibility to 12 broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. the frequency of  resistance to ceftazidime and the molecular epidemiology of ceftazidime-resistant strains was also examined. among the enterobacter spp. and c. freundii isolates,  resistance to third generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime, ceftriaxone) and broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillins (piperacillin), with or without an enzyme inhibitor (piperacillin/tazobactam), was high, e.g., 35 to 50%. the s. marcescens isolates were quite susceptible to all agents tested. both imipenem and cefepime were active against virtually all isolates tested including 84 stably derepressed amp c-producing ceftazidime-resistant strains of enterobacter  spp. and c. freundii. the overall rank order of activity for the six best agents  against these amp c-producing strains was: imipenem (100% susceptible) > amikacin = cefepime (98.6%) > ciprofloxacin = gentamicin = ofloxacin (93.6 to 94.0%). molecular typing studies of ceftazidime-resistant e. cloacae using an automated ribotyping system, as well as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, indicated that although clonal spread of a single strain occurred in some of the medical centers, most of the episodes of bacteremia were caused by patient-unique strains. control of these resistant organisms will require attention to microbiologic recognition of phenotypes, to infection control practices, and to limiting the overuse of certain extended spectrum beta-lactams.

TI  == bacteremia due to enterobacter spp. in cancer patients--analysis of 51 episodes.
AB  == fifty one episodes of bacteremia due to enterobacter spp. appearing within 7 years among 12 301 admissions in a single cancer institution were studied for risk factors, clinical presentation and outcome. fifteen episodes were due to enterobacter aerogenes, 23 due to e. cloacae and 13 due to e. agglomerans. the proportion of bacteremia due to enterobacter spp. among gram-negative bacteremias was 10.1% and infection associated mortality was 13.8%. the incidence in 1989-1995 varied from 3.7 to 8.7% and was relatively stable. most common risk factors were: solid tumors as underlying disease, central venous catheter insertion, prior surgery and prior chemotherapy within 48 h. neutropenia and urinary catheters were not at high risk in either one of the patients subgroups.  comparing two subgroups of 51 bacteremias, monomicrobial and polymicrobial (when  enterobacter spp. was isolated from blood culture with other microorganism), previous chemotherapy, vascular catheter insertion and prior endoscopy were more  frequently associated with polymicrobial enterobacter spp. bacteremia. there was  also differences in infection associated mortality: bacteremias due to enterobacter spp. only had significantly lower mortality in comparison to polymicrobial enterobacter spp. bacteremias (3.3 vs. 29.3%; p<0.02). susceptibility of enterobacter spp. strains isolated from 51 episodes was stable  and showed only two episodes due to quinolone-resistant strains, both in 1992 despite of the use of ofloxacin in prophylaxis of neutropenic patients since 1990 in our institute. ninety-two to 94% of all strains were susceptible to aminoglycosides, 96-98% to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively and 94.9% to meropenem but only 75.5% to ceftazidime.

TI  == beta-lactamases and detection of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacter spp.
AB  == enterobacter spp. are becoming increasingly frequent nosocomial pathogens, and beta-lactam-resistant strains are on the increase, especially among isolates recovered from intensive care units. therefore, a study was designed to characterize the beta-lactamases produced by 80 isolates of e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, e. taylorae, e. gergoviae, e. sakazakii, e. asburiae, and e. agglomerans by induction studies, spectrophotometric hydrolysis assays, and isoelectric focusing. the ability of broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests to detect resistance to 16 beta-lactam antibiotics among these species was also assessed. all species except e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, and some isolates of e. sakazakii were found to produce a bush group 1 cephalosporinase that was expressed inducibly or constitutively at high levels. in addition, some strains also produced a bush group 2 beta-lactamase. in comparisons of broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests, disk diffusion tests failed to detect resistance in 1 of 25 isolates resistant to aztreonam and 2 of 30 isolates resistant to ceftazidime. these results indicate that species of enterobacter can possess a variety of beta-lactamases that are responsible for beta-lactam resistance in this genus and that the disk diffusion test may occasionally miss resistance in some strains.

AB  == intestinal colonization by klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia (kes) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. we studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 kes clinical isolates: 30 klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 serratia sp. (13%) isolates. half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. a total of 27 of 30 k. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line intestine-407 (int-407), while none of the k. oxytoca or e. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the e. cloacae isolates adhered. three adhesive  patterns were observed for k. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. while most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant k. pneumoniae isolates producing the caz-5 beta-lactamase. furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. the distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative e. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific dna probes. no relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.

TI  == comparative activity of eight antimicrobial agents against clinical bacterial isolates from the united states, measured by two methods.
AB  == in a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the united states, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). a total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the etest method (ab biodisk) or a microdilution method (microscan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. the results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. this article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods--microscan and etest--showed that  most isolates of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the  greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and  citrobacter freundii). in addition, the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. most methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were resistant. overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. categorically, the results from the microdilution and etest methods were equivalent.

AB  == previous studies have shown that there is a high incidence of resistance to cephalosporins among enterobacteria isolated in greek hospitals. this resistance  is mainly due to either the derepression of chromosomal cephalosporinases or the  acquisition of plasmids coding for shv-5 type beta-lactamase. in the present study the activity of cefpirome against a number of enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens) possessing the mechanisms mentioned above was examined. cefpirome was found active against all the strains characterized by stable derepression of chromosomal class-c enzymes. the antibiotic was less potent against strains expressing shv-5 type beta-lactamase due to its hydrolysis by the enzyme. also cefpirome exhibited good activity against e. aerogenes strains with  reduced susceptibility to imipenem. these in vitro data suggest that cefpirome might be useful in treating infections caused by these resistant microorganisms that are frequently encountered in greek hospitals.

TI  == the relationship between antecedent antibiotic use and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
AB  == gram-negative pathogens are increasingly resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (escs). using a prospective, case-controlled observational study,  we examined the prevalence and the risk factors for development of resistance to  escs in group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms. of the 386 isolates of enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter species, and serratia marsescens from 340 consecutive patients, 70 (18.1%) were resistant to escs; the  highest rates of resistance were found among citrobacter freundii (40.9%), enterobacter cloacae (31.1%), and enterobacter aerogenes isolates (18.9%). patients' prior antibiotic use and the mean number of antibiotics used were significantly greater in association with resistant vs. susceptible isolates. resistance was associated with prior use of ceftizoxime or cefotaxime (p = .008), ceftazidime (p = .004), and piperacillin (p = .001). other antibiotics were not associated with resistance. resistance was less frequent in patients receiving escs and an aminoglycoside. we conclude that prior use of escs is associated with the isolation of resistant group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms. concomitant use of an aminoglycoside may decrease this risk.

TI  == [utility of pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase detection for typing enterobacteriaceae and  non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == detection of pyrrolidonyl-aryl-amidase activity (pyr) is an important tool to identify gram-positive cocci, such as staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, and other related genera. however, only few studies evaluating its usefulness with gram-negative rods have been published. thus, a prospective study including  542 and 215 unique clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative gram-negative rods, respectively, was undertaken. strains were identified by conventional methods. pyr test was performed using a commercial kit, according to the manufacturer recommendations. positive results were uniformly obtained for the pyr test with the following species: citrobacter spp, klebsiella spp, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans group, serratia marcescens and s. odorifera. on the other hand, negative results were uniformly displayed by e.  coli (including inactive e. coli), protease group, salmonellia spp, shigella spp, acinetobacter spp, burkholderia (pseudomonas) cepacia and flavobacterium spp. variable results were shown in pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) malthophilia, kluyvera cryocrescens, and enterobacter cloacae. pyr  test proved to be a reliable and simple tool to rapidly distinguish certain species belonging to enterobacteriaceae (ie. citrobacter freundii from salmonella spp, and inactive e. coli from k. ozaenae). further studies, including a wide diversity of species, are required to assess usefulness of the pyr test for the identification of non-fermentative gram-negative rods.

AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == ceftibuten: a review of antimicrobial activity, spectrum and other microbiologic  features.
AB  == ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens. more than 90% of recent enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. in only five enteric species (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. enteritis-producing bacteria such as  salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli and yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (mic50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). fastidious gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten mics, including beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas species and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. the microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == demonstration of the indolepyruvate decarboxylase gene homologue in different auxin-producing species of the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == different enterobacteriaceae were assayed for their ability to produce the plant  hormone indole-3-acetate with the aim to study the distribution of the indole-3-pyruvate pathway, which is known to be involved in the production of indole-3-acetate in a root-associated enterobacter cloacae strain. other e. cloacae strains, and also enterobacter agglomerans strains, pantoea agglomerans,  klebsiella aerogenes, and klebsiella oxytoca were found to convert tryptophan into indole-3-acetate. as it was also intended to identify the conserved regions  of the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase, which is involved in producing indole-3-acetate in the e. cloacae strain, oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for different regions of the corresponding gene. one pair of these primers allowed us to amplify a segment of the predicted size by the polymerase chain reaction with dna of the seven different enterobacteriaceae that produce indole-3-acetate. segments of five strains were cloned and sequenced. all sequences showed significant homology to the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase gene. as in addition a positive dna-dna hybridization signal was detected in the  seven strains using the e. cloacae or e. agglomerans segments as a probe, indole-3-acetate biosynthesis is suggested to be catalyzed via the indole-3-pyruvate pathway not only in e. cloacae but also in the other soil-living enterobacteriaceae. conserved regions were detected in the indole-3-decarboxylase by alignment of the now-available five different partial sequences. these regions should enable identification of the gene in other bacterial families or even in plants.

TI  == clinical and bacteriological survey after change in aminoglycoside treatment to control an epidemic of enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the effect of a change in the first line antibiotic treatment in a neonatal unit  was studied. a total of 238 neonates (g1), admitted between 1 january and 31 july 1989, and treated with gentamicin, were compared with 398 (g2) admitted between 1 august 1989 and 31 july 1990 who received amikacin, in the combination of ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside. this change was implemented in an attempt to prevent the spread of an epidemic strain of enterobacter cloacae resistant to third generation cephalosporins and all aminoglycosides, except amikacin. the change in treatment had no effect on the incidence of nosocomial infections [19.7% (g1) vs. 16.3% (g2) rr = 1.21 (0.86-1.70)], but the proportion of patients with nosocomial infections caused by the e. cloacae decreased (6.3% vs. 2.0% rr 3.14 ci 1.35-7.28). certain trends in the bacterial ecology emerged: e. aerogenes and enterococci increased in g2. the proportion of gentamicin-resistant strains such as e. cloacae or staphylococci decreased and there was no increase in aminoglycoside-resistant strains, except in escherichia coli, in which resistance to amikacin rose from 0 to 3%. this study illustrates the influence of antimicrobial therapy on the species and the resistance of strains isolated in nosocomial infections. it also highlights the need for epidemiologic surveillance, and poses the question of how best to modify antibiotic policy.

TI  == detection of resistance due to inducible beta-lactamase in enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == thirty-six of 36 strains of enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes with inducible  beta-lactamase developed resistance when cefoxitin (inducer) was added to cefuroxime disks. constitutive beta-lactamase producers (n = 23) were all resistant to cefuroxime. cefuroxime resistance correlated with the amount of induced or constitutive beta-lactamase. cefuroxime was a better indicator of induced resistance than cefamandole, cefazolin, cephalothin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ticarcillin with or without clavulanic acid, or cefotetan. induction  by addition of cefoxitin to disks occasionally reduced zone sizes but not enough  to change interpretations for ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, aztreonam, cefoperazone with or without sulbactam, and piperacillin with or without tazobactam. most enterobacters were resistant to cefmetazole. the cefoxitin inducer-cefuroxime indicator method can be used in routine clinical laboratories to detect latent resistance due to chromosomally mediated inducible beta-lactamase in enterobacters.

TI  == the tryptophan repressor sequence is highly conserved among the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tryptophan biosynthesis in escherichia coli is regulated by the product of the trpr gene, the tryptophan (trp) repressor. trp aporepressor binds the corepressor, l-tryptophan, to form a holorepressor complex, which binds trp operator dna tightly, and inhibits transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. the conservation of trp operator sequences among enteric gram-negative bacteria suggests that trpr genes from other bacterial species can be cloned by complementation in e. coli. to clone trpr homologues, a deletion of the e. coli trpr gene, delta trpr504, was made on a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, then crossed onto the e. coli genome. plasmid clones of the trpr genes of enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae were isolated by complementation  of the delta trpr504 allele, scored as the ability to repress beta-galactosidase  synthesis from a prophage-borne trpe-lacz gene fusion. the predicted amino acid sequences of four enteric trpr proteins show differences, clustered on the backside of the folded repressor, opposite the dna-binding helix-turn-helix substructures. these differences are predicted to have little effect on the interactions of the aporepressor with tryptophan, holorepressor with operator dna, or tandemly bound holorepressor dimers with one another. although there is some variation observed at the dimer interface, interactions predicted to stabilize the interface are conserved. the phylogenetic relationships revealed by the trpr amino acid sequence alignment agree with the results of others.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ljc 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. ljc 10,627 inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, proteus rettgeri, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. ljc 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than ljc 10,627 against staphylococcus  aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. ljc 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis strains. ljc 10,627 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of ljc 10,627 per ml. serum (50%) did not affect the mics. ljc 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of bush types 2b, 2b', tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, tem-9, and shv-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  bush type 1; p-99; a morganella enzyme; or a citrobacter freundii enzyme. the bush type 2c and 2d enzymes oxa-1, oxa-2, pse-1, pse-2, and pse-4 did not hydrolyze ljc 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, moraxella spp., bacteroides fragilis, and proteus vulgaris. the beta-lactamase of xanthomonas hydrolyzed ljc 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.

TI  == prevalence of a plasmid-mediated type ii dihydrofolate reductase gene among trimethoprim-resistant urinary pathogens in greek hospitals.
AB  == the genetic basis of trimethoprim resistance was examined in 24 klebsiella pneumoniae, 27 enterobacter cloacae, five enterobacter aerogenes and nine serratia marcescens urinary isolates from five hospitals in greece. analysis of the 65 isolates by serotyping and phage-typing identified 53 distinct strains. thirty-eight isolates (15 k. pneumoniae, 19 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes and two  s. marcescens) hybridized with a probe specific for a gene encoding type ii dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr). three of the k. pneumoniae and four of the e. cloacae isolates which reacted with this probe also hybridized with probes specific for type i dhfr and transposon tn7. two e. cloacae isolates hybridized only with the probe for type i dhfr, while a further three isolates hybridized only with the type i dhfr and tn7 probes. none of the isolates hybridized with a  probe for type v dhfr. the plasmids in transconjugants derived from 40 isolates were analysed by digestion with restriction enzymes and southern blotting. eighteen (45%) of the donors (12 k. pneumoniae and 6 e. cloacae) produced transconjugants containing plasmids of about 95 kb in size, while transconjugants from the other donors had plasmids in the range 100-185 kb. of the 18 transconjugants containing a 95 kb plasmid, 15 had similar restriction endonuclease digest patterns, although they varied in terms of the range of antimicrobial resistances which they encoded. when ecori digests of these 15 plasmids were hybridized with the type ii dhfr probe, a 23 kb common band reacted with the probe.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sheen formation and growth response of groundwater bacteria to reduced oxygen concentrations during incubation of m-endo medium.
AB  == in vitro pure-culture studies were conducted to assess growth and sheen formation of groundwater bacteria on m-endo medium incubated under reduced oxygen concentrations (0, 4, 8, 12, and 16%). coliform and noncoliform bacteria were isolated from 17 untreated, rural groundwater supplies on m-endo medium. all 16 coliform isolates tested were capable of sheen formation at oxygen concentrations of 4% or greater, yet some of these same isolates (enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and hafnia alvei) were either unable to grow or failed to produce a metallic sheen when incubated under strict anaerobiosis. approximately  70% of the 21 noncoliform isolates examined exhibited growth inhibition at oxygen concentrations of 8% or less. the growth of a false-positive coliform isolate of  serratia fonticola was inhibited when incubated under reduced oxygen concentrations of 16% or less. our findings suggest that the selectivity of m-endo medium, and resultant inhibition of noncoliforms and false-positive coliforms, is enhanced by incubation in the absence of oxygen. however, the failure of strict anaerobiosis to permit detection of total coliforms such as hafnia and enterobacter spp. may compromise the reliability of this technique for evaluating the sanitary quality of some waters. on the other hand, oxygen concentrations of 4, 8, 12, and 16% permitted adequate sheen development of all coliforms tested while inhibiting some noncoliforms.

TI  == retrospective 6-year study of enterobacter bacteraemia in a danish university hospital.
AB  == in order to study the epidemiology of invasive enterobacter infections, data from 53 consecutive cases of bacteraemia due to this organism were compared with data  from 72 randomly selected cases of escherichia coli bacteraemia. the cases occurred among patients admitted to a danish university hospital over a 6-year period. forty-eight cases were due to enterobacter cloacae and five were due to ent. aerogenes. enterobacter bacteraemia was more often of nosocomial origin than e. coli bacteraemia and more often polymicrobial. patients suffering from enterobacter bacteraemia were younger than e. coli patients, and males tended to  predominate. apart from cancer of the prostate, other malignant diseases tended to be more frequent among patients with enterobacter bacteraemia than among e. coli patients. enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with a focus in central venous catheters and burns, whereas patients with e. coli bacteraemia more often showed a focus of infection in the urinary tract. patients with enterobacter bacteraemia and a microbiologically documented focus in the respiratory tract or the urinary tract more often had an endotracheal tube or indwelling urinary catheter compared to patients with e. coli bacteraemia with a  similar focus of infection. in patients with no microbiologically documented focus enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with the presence of central and peripheral venous catheters. during the preceding 12 weeks patients with enterobacter bacteraemia, more often than e. coli patients, had been treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, especially penicillins. the close association with  devices may indicate that enterobacter has a special affinity for foreign body material. studies are planned to elucidate this aspect in further detail.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == beta-lactamase expression and cross-resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in a nosocomial population of enterobacter.
AB  == this study sought to quantitatively describe the spectrum of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamase activity present in a tertiary care center's population  of enterobacter species. beta-lactamase activity in the absence and presence of 2 recognized beta-lactamase-inducing antibiotics, cefoxitin and imipenem, was measured. the enterobacter cloacae (n = 35) population was strikingly bimodal, expressing 'all-or-none' cross-resistance to beta-lactams (except imipenem) corresponding to the baseline level of beta-lactamase expression. e. aerogenes (n = 14) displayed a less dichotomous pattern of resistance, and mics of beta-lactam antibiotics were less strongly related to the magnitude of enzyme activity. we conclude that our nosocomial population of e. cloacae, like strains rendered resistant to beta-lactams in vitro, is largely dependent upon beta-lactamase as a mechanism of this resistance. furthermore, we document the presence of a large subpopulation of beta-lactam-susceptible isolates possessing inducible beta-lactamase and therefore subject to selection for enzyme derepression.

TI  == cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == growth kinetics of coliform bacteria under conditions relevant to drinking water  distribution systems.
AB  == the growth of environmental and clinical coliform bacteria under conditions typical of drinking water distribution systems was examined. four coliforms (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from an operating drinking water system for study; an enterotoxigenic e. coli strain and clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli were also used. all but one of the coliforms tested were capable of growth in unsupplemented mineral salts medium; the environmental isolates had greater specific growth rates than did the clinical isolates. this trend was maintained when the organisms were grown with low levels (less than 1 mg liter-1) of yeast extract. the environmental k. pneumoniae isolate had a greater yield, higher specific growth rates, and a lower ks value than the other organisms. the  environmental e. coli and the enterotoxigenic e. coli strains had comparable yield, growth rate, and ks values to those of the environmental k. pneumoniae strain, and all three showed significantly more successful growth than the clinical isolates. the environmental coliforms also grew well at low temperatures on low concentrations of yeast extract. unsupplemented distribution water from the collaborating utility supported the growth of the environmental isolates. growth of the k. pneumoniae water isolate was stimulated by the addition of autoclaved biofilm but not by tubercle material. these findings indicate that growth of environmental coliforms is possible under the conditions found in operating municipal drinking water systems and that these bacteria could be used  in tests to determine assimilable organic carbon in potable water.

TI  == aztreonam: a review of the first monobactam.
AB  == aztreonam represents the first synthetic monobactam marketed in the united states and is being viewed as a nontoxic alternative to the aminoglycosides. advantages  of aztreonam over the aminoglycosides include lack of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity and better penetration into the csf. additional advantages include its use in penicillin and cephalosporin allergic patients. disadvantages of aztreonam compared to the aminoglycosides include the cost of the drug (50 times  more expensive than gentamicin), the lack of post antibiotic effect, resistance to p. aeruginosa, and lack of significant activity against enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes. there are insufficient clinical trials to document the superiority of aztreonam over the "gold standard" therapy for gram-negative infections--the aminoglycosides. the restricted anti-microbial spectrum of aztreonam has been proposed as an advantage. theoretically, this would permit targeting of a gram-negative pathogen with minimal disruption of the (largely anaerobic) intestinal flora. in fact, use of this drug has been associated with colonization of gram-positive organism, especially enterococci. although aztreonam appears to be an excellent antibiotic, its use has been limited by its  relatively high cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and the availability of numerous alternative agents.

TI  == concomitant dissemination of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among different enterobacteriaceae isolated in a french hospital.
AB  == from january 1988 to august 1989, 267 non-repetitive strains of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbla) derived from tem (ctx-1/tem-3, caz-6) or shv (caz-5) were isolated from 219 colonized or  infected patients. esblas were characterized by analytical isoelectric focusing.  biotypes, resistance phenotypes and plasmid patterns were determined in order to  differentiate the isolates in each species. among the 116 ctx-1-producing enterobacteriaceae, 48 strains were differentiated: 27 from 74 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, seven from 22 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 14 from a combined total of seven k. oxytoca, five serratia marcescens, six escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter cloacae and 1 citrobacter freundii. caz-5 has been isolated  since january 1988 in 16 different strains among 101 k. pneumoniae isolates. caz-6 was first identified in k. pneumoniae (january 1988). among the 48 enterobacteriaceae producing caz-6, 12 strains were differentiated: four from 39  e. aerogenes isolates, three from four k. pneumoniae, and five from a combined total of two s. marcescens, two e. coli and one e. cloacae. during this outbreak, ctx-1 was found to be encoded by 85 kb (inc 7/m) or greater than or equal to 150  kb (inc 6/c) plasmids. caz-6 was always encoded by an 85 kb (inc 7/m) plasmid and caz-5 by a greater than 150 kb plasmid. these results show that strain epidemics  and plasmid dissemination occurred mainly in k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes for ctx-1, in e. aerogenes for caz-6, and in k. pneumoniae for caz-5. they also suggest that the bla(tem) gene (ctx-1) has spread between different plasmids present in the same ecosystem.

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility and beta-lactamase production in clinical isolates of enterobacter spp.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of 237 clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. (e. aerogenes, e. agglomerans and e. cloacae; 41, 64 and 132 respectively) to 16 different antibiotics is described. four quinolones (ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin), two new cephalosporins (cefpirome and cefepime) and imipenem, all showed high activity against the three enterobacter species tested  (mic50 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l, mic90 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). also the aminoglycosides gentamicin and tobramycin were highly active antibiotics (mic50 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l, mic90 less than or equal to 1.0 mg/l). the susceptibility of beta-lactam-antibiotics to beta-lactamase produced by enterobacter spp. was evaluated, and imipenem and cefepime were found to be most  stable. different methods for detection of inducible beta-lactamases were used, the agar dilution method being more sensitive than the double-disc diffusion test. elevated beta-lactamase production was detected, via induction, in 83% of e. aerogenes strains and 70% of e. cloacae strains, with cefamandole used as the  substrate and cefoxitin as the inducer. constitutive, high level enzyme production was detected in 7 and 13% respectively of the e. aerogenes and the e.  cloacae strains. in all the strains of e. agglomerans, 10% of e. aerogenes and 13% of e. cloacae, no beta-lactamases could be detected with the methods studied.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of tem-3 (ctx-1) beta-lactamase.
AB  == a total of 33 clinical isolates encoding tem-3 (ctx-1) from four french hospitals were studied. the strains belonged to seven species, klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), escherichia coli (n = 3), serratia marcescens (n = 2), citrobacter freundii  (n = 1), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). all the strains harbored an inc7 or m self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. the plasmids had closely related ecori, hincii, hindiii, and pvuii restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the  genes blatem-3 and tetc, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aaca4, aada, and dfri and of insertion element is15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. plasmid pcff04, the prototype plasmid encoding tem-3, was widespread and appeared, by southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. the plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of tem-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae may have originated in s. marcescens since pcff04 was first detected in this species.

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == clinical efficacy of carumonam.
AB  == carumonam is a new n-sulfo-beta-lactam antibiotic active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria. an open study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of carumonam with either 1 g t.i.d. (group a) or 2 g t.i.d.  (group b) in bacterial septicaemia or severe sepsis. a total of 24 patients (14 men and 10 women) were included in the study, their ages ranged from 48-87 years  (mean age 59). eighteen patients were treated for bacteraemia, three for bronchopneumonia, two for urinary tract infection and one for a subphrenic abscess; seven were in group a and fourteen in group b; three were treated with a variable regimen. the pathogens isolated included e. coli [10], klebsiella aerogenes [9], enterobacter cloacae [3], citrobacter freundii [2], pseudomonas spp. [4], providence stuartii [2], serratia marcescens [1] and haemophilus influenzae [1]. clinical improvement occurred in all patients in both groups. one patient in group a and four patients in group b required further antibiotic therapy. the overall clinical cure rate was 84% and the bacteriological cure rate was 72%. supra-infection occurred in three patients and adverse reactions attributable to carumonam were seen in two patients: diarrhoea (in one), and aggravation of renal failure in the other. carumonam is well tolerated at both the dosage regimens; it is effective in the treatment of aerobic gram-negative sepsis.

TI  == activity of cefixime (fk 027) for resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == cefixime is an orally absorbable cephalosporin with an extended spectrum of in vitro activity for gram-negative bacteria especially members of the enterobacteriaceae. gram-negative rod isolates collected over a three month period were tested against cefixime. greater than 99% of escherichia coli isolates was susceptible to cefixime including those resistant to ampicillin. similarly isolates of klebsiella, proteus and providencia were also exquisitely susceptible to cefixime as were 91% of enterobacter cloacae and 71% of enterobacter aerogenes. killing kinetics of cefixime did not differ from that of  the intravenously administered third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime. the addition of magnesium and calcium divalent cations or the lowering of the ph to 5.0 did not affect the action of this antibiotic. the extended spectrum of this oral antibiotic may be useful in treatment of urinary tract and skin and soft tissue infections caused by the more resistant gram-negative rods.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [pseudomonas aeruginosa and surgical intensive care units].
AB  == the prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care unit (icu) is 19 per cent although its incidence in blood culture is only 3.5 per cent and remains the same even though the total prevalence of this bacterium increases. a review of the clinical results shows that this germ causes severe complications in only 3 per cent of patients. a study by epidemiological markers reveals the presence of  16 different iats serotypes in the icu, this distribution of the serotypes being  similar to this observed in ambulatory patients. the serotype 12 of ps. aeruginosa is multiresistant. in 1984, it represented 22 per cent of the isolated ps. aeruginosa, its incidence decreases in 1985 and in 1986 (14.5%). ps. aeruginosa seems weakly pathogenic for the surgical patients in the icu. on the other hand, the incidence of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens (014 imm. serotype resistant to tobramycin), enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae increases in blood cultures proportionally to their total prevalence in icu. these bacteria are probably responsible for hospital epidemics.

TI  == patients' endogenous flora as the source of "nosocomial" enterobacter in cardiac  surgery.
AB  == we prospectively studied enterobacter colonization in cardiac surgery patients receiving cefazolin prophylaxis. fifty-eight (67%) of 87 patients became colonized, 28 by the time of admission to a cardiac surgery intensive care unit.  enterobacter cloacae was four times more prevalent than enterobacter aerogenes. we found increased enterobacter colonization, after prophylaxis, in 45% of surgery patients. none of 25 control patients, who underwent coronary angioplasty and received no antibiotic prophylaxis, showed increased colonization (p = .001). both groups had similar baseline rates of enterobacter carriage. typing showed 50 distinct strains of e. cloacae and 11 of e. aerogenes; 25% of patients carried greater than or equal to 2 strains simultaneously. in the nine cases of horizontal transmission, source patients were intubated for greater than or equal to 5 days and had heavy throat carriage of enterobacter. no environmental sources of transmission were found. clinical enterobacter infection developed in 12 patients; at least nine of these were infected with a strain that had been isolated by surveillance culture. we conclude that enterobacter, part of the patients' endogenous flora, becomes an important pathogen when amplified by prophylactic antibiotics and is less often transmitted horizontally.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in members of the family enterobacteriaceae from ohio.
AB  == epidemiologic studies of plasmid-mediated resistance at the cleveland veterans administration medical center revealed that related plasmids had disseminated among members of the family enterobacteriaceae. we studied the beta-lactamases encoded by these plasmids in escherichia coli c600 transformants or transconjugants. substrate and inhibition profiles of the enzymes determined by two of these plasmids suggested an activity resembling tem-1; however, isoelectric focusing revealed a pi of 7.0. these two plasmids were originally found in a serratia marcescens (pds076) and an enterobacter cloacae (pds075) strain isolated from the same sink in the medical intensive care unit and later,  in an enterobacter cloacae (pds142 identical to pds076) isolate colonizing a patient in the same unit. the plasmids also carried the aminoglycoside resistance determinant, 2"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase. a 2-kilobase avai restriction endonuclease digestion fragment of psd075 known to carry the beta-lactamase determinant was used as a molecular probe. this probe did not recognize sequences of any plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase tested including the recently described determinants rob-1, tle-1, and oxa-4-7. a tem-1 probe derived  from the 0.7-kilobase psti-ecori fragment of pbr322 failed to recognize the new beta-lactamase gene. four additional enterobacter cloacae and two enterobacter aerogenes strains isolated in columbus, ohio, have been shown to produce a pi 7.0 beta-lactamase and to carry plasmids recognized by the 2-kilobase probe. these data suggest dissemination of a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase among members of the family enterobacteriaceae in ohio and demonstrate the development  and utility of a molecular probe for the new determinant. we suggest that the novel beta-lactamase be named ohio-1.

AB  == strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae that were resistant to ceftazidime (mic greater than 16 micrograms/ml) but susceptible to bmy 28142 (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml) were found to contain higher levels of beta-lactamase activity (50- to 3,340-fold) than control strains of the corresponding species. ceftazidime was at least as resistant as bmy 28142  to hydrolysis by these enzymes. however, the apparent ki of bmy 28142 for each enzyme was larger (8- to greater than 20-fold) than that of ceftazidime; i.e., the affinity of these enzymes for bmy 28142 appeared to be lower than that for ceftazidime. thus, bmy 28142 was affected less than ceftazidime by a mechanism of resistance that depends, at least in part, on the relative affinities of cephalosporins for the beta-lactamases of these species. these results indicate that the affinity between a beta-lactamase and a cephalosporin may be a distinguishing factor in the evaluation of beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins and suggest that affinity can play a major role in susceptibility  to highly beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins.

TI  == inducible type i beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == mutants, showing either constitutive (depressed) or non-inducible expression of chromosomally-mediated type i beta-lactamase were obtained from clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, ent. aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the wild-type and mutant strains were compared for susceptibility to a range of beta-lactam antibiotics. derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis generally, but  not always, resulted in a marked reduction in susceptibility to the agents tested, including the '3rd generation' cephalosporins. in many cases, the observed resistance would preclude, or severely compromise, the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs. in this context, depressed mutants of enterobacter spp., citro. freundii and ps. aeruginosa could be of primary concern although those of  ser. marcescens, prov. stuartii and morg. morganii often exhibited equally high resistance levels to older beta-lactams. comparison of the susceptibilities of the non-inducible mutants with that of their inducible parents suggested variation in the beta-lactamase inductive potency of different compounds in different organisms. for example, cefoxitin was a powerful inducer in ent. cloacae, citro. freundii and one strain of ps. aeruginosa; similarly cefazolin and cefuroxime were good beta-lactamase inducers in ser. marcescens and morg. morganii. aminothiazolyl-oxime cephalosporins and ureido-penicillins were generally poor inducers. from such comparisons, the contribution of inducible type i beta-lactamase to resistance phenotype could be ascertained.

AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
AB  == solutions of clinifeed iso, triosorbon, vivonex standard (full- and half-strength) and vivonex hn were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees c and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. no increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees c. all organisms multiplied rapidly in clinifeed iso and in triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees c. there was less rapid growth in half-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, although at 37 degrees c all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two s. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength vivonex standard at both 25 and 37 degrees c. in full-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, only p. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas p. aeruginosa, k.  aerogenes and e. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees c. none of the test organisms multiplied in full strength vivonex hn at any of the temperatures studied. the results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low ph and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.

TI  == influence of imipenem on the serum resistance of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == following growth in a subinhibitory concentration of imipenem and additional incubation in a 20% dilution of normal human serum (nhs) for 90 minutes, five of  12 serum-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae showed a decrease in colony-forming units of two or more logs of growth compared with the control. two strains (of escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes) showed this phenomenon even with incubation in 5% nhs. treatment with imipenem did not change the serum  resistance of the other seven strains (two strains each of enterobacter cloacae,  klebsiella pneumonia, and serratia marcescens, and one strain of proteus morganii). the phenomenon of induced serum susceptibility is dose dependent and reversible. other beta-lactam antibiotics either caused only a slight decrease of resistance (cefsulodin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefodizime-hr221) or did not influence the serum resistance at all (cefotaxime, mecillinam). killing of the induced serum-sensitive strains appeared to be antibody dependent.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins: beta-lactamase characterization and susceptibility to sch 34343.
AB  == we studied 192 recent clinical isolates, comprising six species of gram-negative  bacilli resistant either to cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), from several hospitals. all isolates were resistant to several other third-generation cephalosporins or a monobactam. two to five types of chromosomal beta-lactamases, as defined by isoelectric focusing, were readily identified in each species. isolates of citrobacter, enterobacter and serratia produced higher levels of chromosomal beta-lactamase than corresponding cefotaxime-susceptible strains. in  addition, 20 of 57 produced one or two plasmid-determined beta-lactamases, tem-1, oxa-2, or a novel enzyme, ohio-1. the penem and carbapenem antibiotics, sch 34343 and imipenem, were more active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, latamoxef and aztreonam against isolates of acinetobacter, citrobacter, ent. aerogenes, ent. cloacae and morganella, whereas imipenem, ceftazidime, and aztreonam were more active against serratia isolates. the addition of plasmid-determined beta-lactamase increased resistance to piperacillin, cefoperazone and cefamandole but not to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, latamoxef, aztreonam, sch 34343, or imipenem. of 24 strains susceptible to aminoglycosides, none produced a plasmid-determined beta-lactamase, whereas 20 were found among the 33 strains resistant to aminoglycosides. resistance of clinical isolates to newer beta-lactams appears to be due primarily to a high level of chromosomal cephalosporinase present without inducing agents. the plasmid-determined beta-lactamases, tem-1 and ohio-1, contributed little to resistance to most of the newer beta-lactams but were strongly associated with aminoglycoside resistance in these selected isolates. the greater in-vitro efficacy of the penem and carbapenem antibiotics, sch 34343 and imipenem, against most of these isolates makes them promising candidates as first line agents against these pathogens.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == [enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes septicemia: emergence of resistant variants (derepressed cephalosporinase) during treatment with third-generation cephalosporins].
AB  == from three patients hospitalised in intensive care units with enterobacter septicaemia (two cases with e. cloacae, and one with e. aerogenes), cefotaxime therapy, alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside, selected variants (r) with increased resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. the cross-resistance extended to all the beta-lactam antibiotics tested, penicillins and cephalosporins, including third-generation cephalosporins. the crude extracts of  uninduced cultures of r variants showed high beta-lactamase activity and of the cephalosporinase type. these variants were selected in vitro with a frequency of  10(-6) to 10(-7) and may result from a mutation involving the regulation of enterobacter cephalosporinases, usually inducible. data from the literature indicated that this new type of resistance is actually emerging and observed not  only in enterobacter sp. the problem of emergence of r variants exhibiting cross-resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics should be considered when third-generation cephalosporins are used.

TI  == typing of enterobacter spp. by bacteriocin susceptibility and its use in epidemiological analysis.
AB  == most clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae are bacteriocinogenic and susceptible to bacteriocins. both rapidly diffusing, nonsedimentable, protease-susceptible and slowly diffusing, sedimentable, protease-resistant bacteriocins are produced. a practicable system was devised for epidemiological typing of e. cloacae isolates by their patterns of susceptibility to bacteriocins. a set of eight bacteriocin-producing strains was grown on tryptic soy agar plates for 16 h. after removal of the producer lawn, the isolates to be  typed were inoculated on the agar media by a multipoint inoculator. after a second 16-h period of incubation, the strains were classified into bacteriocin types according to the patterns of growth inhibition. typability of 134 clinical  isolates was 96.3%. only 11 (8.2%) of the isolates fell into the largest group. repeat testing of isolates from the same patients within 2 months gave identical  bacteriocin types. other species of enterobacter (e. agglomerans and e. aerogenes) are also typable by this method.

AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. it was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. it had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.  it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis or listeria spp. cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam  against escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, and shigella. it inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  aerogenes, and enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration  for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), proteus vulgaris and providencia spp. it was as active as ceftizoxime was against serratia. pseudomonas spp. and bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for  90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). the compound was stable to the  common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of tem. it was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by bacteroides and acinetobacter.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  == apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone  against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to  that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.

TI  == mutational enzymatic resistance of enterobacter species to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == mutants with enhanced beta-lactam resistance were selected from strains of enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes by using three antibiotics. high-level beta-lactamase-producing mutants had similar degrees of increased resistance, enzyme substrate profiles, and isoelectric (pi) values irrespective of the selective agent. reverse mutants from a resistant e. cloacae mutant regained the  susceptibility pattern originally exhibited by the wild type, or were of enhanced susceptibility, and no longer expressed increased beta-lactamase production. beta-lactamases of the mutants were similar in pi values to the wild-type enzyme. the increased resistance of the mutants therefore appeared to be accounted for by increased beta-lactamase production.

TI  == potent cephalosporinase inhibitors: 7 beta-[2-(1, 3-dithiolan-2-ylidene) acetamido] cephalosporins and related compounds.
AB  == cephalosporins possessing a 1, 3-dithiolane, 1, 3-dithiane, or 1, 3-dithietane ring on their 7 beta-substituents showed potent inhibitory activity against cephaloridine hydrolysis by cephalosporinases purified from proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, and proteus inconstans, which were not inhibited by clavulanic  acid, a well-known beta-lactamase inhibitor. the mode of inhibition was competitive. the dithiolane cephalosporins themselves were stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases tested. a combination of a dithiolane cephalosporin and cephaloridine synergistically inhibited in vitro growth of strains of p. morganii, p. rettgeri, p. inconstans, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens.

TI  == ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis, with the mean mics varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. it had marked activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with a  mean mic of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against e. coli, k. aerogenes and ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean mics between 5 and 21 mg/l. these results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due  to strains of the enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of fr-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(n-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the in  vitro activity of fr-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. in vitro activity of fr-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. the type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with mueller-hinton, heart infusion, or trypticase soy agars. fr-31564  was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and citrobacter. it was less active than fosfomycin against serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. fr-31564 inhibited a number of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. in the presence and absence of human blood fr-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and p. aeruginosa exposed to fr-31564 for  3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. fr-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with p. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. it was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with e. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

(i) k. aerogenes was the most common among klebsiella species, k. ozaenae and k. atlantae occurred frequently, k. pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis,  k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca were found rarely. the strains isolated from urine showed the most heterogeneous species distribution. enterobacter species were in  the order of frequency e. cloacae, e. liquefaciens, e. aerogenes. (ii) k. aerogenes strains belonged to 10, k. atlantae strains to 6 phage types; phage type ii.a1 was the most frequent phage types. typability varied between 23.7% and 48.0% with the different klebsiella species, except k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca strains. none of the strains of these species were typable by phages. among the enterobacter species examined, only one e. liquefaciens strain was typable by phages. strains of genus enterobacter were lysed by the diagnostic phage c14 in 64%, no lysis was observed in the strains of genus klebsiella. (iii) multiple resistance was demonstrated in 36.6% of klebsiella strains and in 16.5% of enterobacter strains. the majority of the multiresistant strains was isolated from urine in both genera. multiresistant strains belonged to the species k. aerogenes, e. cloacae and e. liquefaciens. strains resistant to ampicillin were divided into 6 groups on the basis of cephaloridine and cephalothin resistance. the rate of multiresistant strains was higher among the klebsiella and enterobacter strains not typable by phages than in the typable ones.

AB  == the competition of a number of beta-lactam morphogenic probes for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli has been studied. the results indicate that the various gram-negative bacteria have similar, but not identical, pbp patterns and that the individual proteins probably perform similar morphogenic functions as in e. coli k-12. comparison of  the 50% binding concentrations of the compounds for the various pbps of the five  strains with their antibacterial activity indicates that the different antibiotics are excluded to a greater or lesser degree by the outer membrane permeability barrier and that the exclusion is most pronounced in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [on the contamination of the citric acid fermentation. i. the contamination by representatives of enterobacteriaceae (author's transl)].
AB  == among the most dangerous bacterial contaminations of the citric acid fermentation is the so-called brown contamination, which is called forth by non pathogenic representatives of enterobacteriaceae like escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, while other bacteria do not produce the mentioned contamination. there is given a comprehensive characterization of the brown contamination. enterobacteriaceae interrupt the growth of the mycelium of the mold aspergillus niger and stop the production of citric acid, produce a characteristic repugnant smell and reduce nitrate to nitrite. in a case of weak contamination the phenomena of the brown contamination do not appear, but the yield of citric acid is rather low. the contamination may  be transferred successfully within the first 24 hrs. of incubation. the effect of the bacteria is determined by their virulence and some other factors.

TI  == differentiation of serratia marcescens and serratia liquefaciens by tests for lipase and phospholipase production.
AB  == the production of lipase and phospolipase by certain members of the enterobacteriaceae was examined by thin-layer chromatography of resting-cell suspensions incubated with triolein or lecithin. most strains of serratia marcescens produced both enzymes while most strains of serratia liquefaciens exhibited strong lipase but only a minor phospholipase activity. enterobacter spp. (25 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains), escherichia coli (15 strains), citrobacter freundii (7 strains) and proteus spp. (20 strains) lacked both types of enzymic activity except for the following: three strains of enterobacter cloacae, two of proteus mirabilis and three of proteus vulgaris possessed slight lipase activity; about one-half of the enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter hafniae strains examined produced slight phospholipase activity. it is suggested that tests for lipase and phospholipase should be used in conjunction with those for dnaase production and sugar fermentation for the differentiation of s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens.

AB  == a hospital strain of enterobacter aerogenes (mulb 250) isolated from a urinary tract infection was found to be cephalosporin and ampicillin resistant and carbenicillin susceptible. the beta-lactamase produced by this strain was extracted and purified by means of affinity chromatography, using a cephalosporin c-bound sepharose 4b column. the purified enzyme was tested for hydrolysis of penicillin and various cephalosporins. the k(m) value is 11.8 mum for benzyl penicillin and 130 mum for cephalosporin c. the isoelectric point of the enzyme is 9.3, and its molecular weight is 29,500 +/- 1,000. rabbit antiserum obtained against this mulb 250 beta-lactamase showed no cross-reaction with other penicillinases or cephalosporinases in neutralization tests. comparisons of results obtained with other beta-lactamases, particularly from enterobacter cloacae p99, indicate that the enterobacter mulb 250 enzyme presents a typical cephalosporinase profile. as far as we know, this type of enzyme is relatively rare.

AB  == a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of  the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a  potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and  cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.

(i) there are three species of enterobacteria producing prodigiosin: s. marcescens, s. plymuthica and s. marinorubra. (2) there are four species of serratia, one colourless (s. liquefaciens). (3) subphenons (biovars) are described within the four species of  serratia. (4) non-pigmented wild-type strains of s. marcescens can generally be differentiated from pigmented strains by characters other than pigmentation, because subphenons are homogeneous with respect to pigmentation. this survey raised some problems of nomenclature because old descriptions could be found that could loosely fit the present phenons. comparison with an authentic culture was considered to be the most objective way of identifying these phenons with earlier named species.

AB  == the regulatory properties of partially purified adenosine 5'-diphosphate-(adp) glucose pyrophosphorylase from two serratia marcescens strains (atcc 274 and atcc 15365) have been studied. slight or negligible activation by fructose-p2, pyridoxal-phosphate, or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) was observed. these compounds were previously shown to be potent activators of the adpglucose pyrophosphorylases from the enterics, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii,  escherichia aurescens, shigella dysenteriae, and escherichia coli. phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated the rate of adpglucose synthesis catalyzed by serratia adpglucose pyrophosphorylase about 1.5- to 2-fold but did not affect the s0.5 values (concentration of substrate required for 50% maximal stimulation) of  the substrates, alpha-glucose-1-phosphate, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate. adenosine 5'-monophosphate (amp), a potent inhibitor of the enteric adpglucose pyrophosphorylase, is an effective inhibitor of the s. marcescens enzyme. adp also inhibits but is not as effective as amp. activators of the enteric enzyme counteract the inhibition caused by amp. this is in contrast to what is observed  for the s. marcescens enzyme. neither phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose-diphosphate,  pyridoxal-phosphate, nadph, 3-phosphoglycerate, fructose-6-phosphate, nor pyruvate effect the inhibition caused by amp. the properties of the s. marcescens hy strain and serratia liquefaciens adpglucose pyrophosphorylase were found to be similar to the above two s. marcescens enzymes with respect to activation and inhibition. these observations provide another example where the properties of an enzyme found in the genus serratia have been found to be different from the properties of the same enzyme present in the enteric genera escherichia, salmonella, shigella, citrobacter, and enterobacter.

TI  == citrate metabolism in aerobacter cloacae.
AB  == growth of aerobacter cloacae on citrate either anaerobically or aerobically did not require and was not stimulated by the presence of na(+) in the medium. citrate was metabolized anaerobically via the fermentation pathway as evidenced by the (i) presence of oxalacetate decarboxylase, (ii) induction of citrate lyase, and (iii) repression of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase under anaerobic  conditions. thus, although all the other enzymes of the citric acid cycle were present in anaerobic cells, this pathway was not available for the metabolism of  citrate. citrate was metabolized aerobically via the citric acid cycle, since (i) citrate lyase but not oxalacetate decarboxylase was repressed and (ii) alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was induced under these conditions. the presence of na(+) in the medium did not lead to a repression of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase as in the case of aerobacter aerogenes. the oxalacetate decarboxylase was a soluble, constitutive enzyme, not activated by na(+) nor inhibited by avidin. it was slightly inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate but was not stimulated by mg(2+) or mn(2+). thus, this enzyme differed markedly in its properties from the same enzyme found in citrate-grown a. aerogenes.

AB  == samples of beef cattle feedlot waste (flw), runoff from the pens, and water from  a large drainage ditch at the feedlot were examined for enterobacteriaceae. the drainage ditch receives the runoff but contains primarily subsurface drainage from fields on which flw is spread for disposal. planting and enrichment techniques with seven different media were used to isolate 553 cultures of enterobacteria. flw contains about 50 million enterobacteria/g dry weight. more than 90% of these were escherichia coli, none of which were enteropathogenic types as determined with multivalent sera. citrobacter and enterobacter cloacae were other organisms present in moderate numbers. application of enrichment techniques broadened the spectrum of enterobacteria isolates to include the four  proteus spp., both providencia spp., klebsiella, enterobacter aerogenes, arizona, and a single isolate of salmonella (serological group c(2)). shigella was not isolated. the wide spectrum of enterobacteria in flw may be a hazard if unsterilized waste is refed. fewer enterobacteria occurred in the runoff and in the drainage ditch; the most numerous species in flw also were most numerous at these sites. however, neither salmonella nor arizona was isolated from runoff or  drainage-ditch waters.

TI  == comparison of the substrate specificities of the -lactamases from klebsiella aerogenes 1082e and enterobacter cloacae p99.
AB  == a potent beta-lactamase (ec 3.5.2.6) produced by a strain of klebsiella aerogenes (k. pneumoniae), 1082e, isolated from a hospital patient, has been examined. its  properties were different from those of most gram-negative beta-lactamases previously reported. the enzyme has been partly purified, and its activity against a range of substrates has been compared with that of the enzyme from enterobacter cloacae (aerobacter cloacae) p99. the k. aerogenes enzyme, although  predominantly a penicillinase, had a wide range of specificity. in addition to hydrolyzing the cephalosporins, it attacked the normally beta-lactamaseresistant  compounds methicillin and cloxacillin as well as cephalosporin analogues with the same acyl substituents. the results obtained with the e. cloacae enzyme confirmed its cephalosporinase activity and showed that, unlike the enzyme from k. aerogenes, it was relatively inactive against the penicillins.

TI  == relation of beta-lactamase activity and cellular location to resistance of enterobacter to penicillins and cephalosporins.
AB  == the enterobacter species e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. hafnia were examined for resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives. all were resistant to benzyl penicillin, ampicillin, 6 [d(-)alpha-amino-p-hydroxyphenylacetamido] penicillanic acid, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin. a significant number were sensitive to carbenicillin and 6 [d(-)alpha-carboxy-3-thienylacetamido] penicillanic acid. no differences among the three species were noted. the beta-lactamase activity was cell-bound, and was not released by osmotic shock, toluene treatment, or diphenylamine treatment. it  was rarely released into the growth medium. the beta-lactamase activity was primarily directed against cephalosporin derivatives. synthesis of beta-lactamase was chromosomally mediated. resistance to ampicillin seemed to be partly related  to entry of the molecule into the bacteria since exposure to ethylenediaminetetraacetate lowered the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == some relationships between r-factor and chromosomal -lactamase in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == 1. the beta-lactamases specified by klebsiella aerogenes 418 and the r-factor r-7268 have been partially purified. 2. the molecular weights of the k. aerogenes strains 418 and 373, aerobacter cloacae 53, r-7268 and r-tem beta-lactamases were all about 20000; that of the enzymes from escherichia coli strains 419 and 214t was about 31000. 3. these enzymes were also compared by means of their k(m) values for benzylpenicillin and ampicillin, and their behaviour on starch-gel electrophoresis. 4. the beta-lactamases specified by the two klebsiella strains,  the aerobacter strain, and the r-factors r-tem and r-7268 were found to comprise  a broadly similar group. however, within this group, only two enzymes seemed to be identical, namely those specified by the two r-factors. the two e. coli strains produce identical beta-lactamases which are very different from the ;klebsiella/aerobacter-type' enzymes.

TI  == relationship between beta-lactamase activity and resistance of enterobacter to cephalothin.
AB  == the relationship between cephalosporin beta-lactamase activity and resistance to  cephalothin was investigated in strains of enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes. beta-lactamase activity was detected in all strains, but a quantitative correlation between amount of beta-lactamase activity and level of resistance to  cephalothin was not observed. permeability barriers to cephalothin were observed  and varied from strain to strain. beta-lactamase activity was increased by growing organisms in the presence of penicillin g. these enzymes hydrolyzed cephalosporins more rapidly than penicillins. penicillinase-resistant penicillins, especially those of the isoxazolyl series, effectively inhibited enterobacter beta-lactamase. a synergistic antibacterial effect was observed when organisms were exposed to cephalothin and oxacillin in combination, and the resistance of even very small inocula to cephalothin was reduced by addition of oxacillin. oxacillin probably exerts its effect by inhibiting beta-lactamase at an intracellular site. intracellular beta-lactamase may make an important contribution to the resistance of even small inocula of gram-negative bacilli to  cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics. although beta-lactamase plays a significant role in the resistance of enterobacter to cephalothin, other factors, such as permeability barriers, also participate in determining the level of resistance.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == in a period of two years, 865 strains of gram-negative bacilli other than pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. the commonest species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterobacter  cloacae. many strains of klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacterium anitratum were also found.a large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. the proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different  antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. a large proportion of the strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. multiple resistance occurred less  often among strains of e. coli than among klebsiella spp, enterobacter spp, and p. mirabilis. phage and serological typing of ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  == effect of coliform and proteus bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of coliform and proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth. inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 c). time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. when the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 c (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of proteus. when the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 c, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 c, and only escherichia coli delayed  the coccus at 30 c. all effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 c when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. greatest overall  inhibition was by e. coli, e. freundii, and proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 c. aerobacter cloacae and paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 c. in general, results were similar with different strains of a species. except for aerobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp., and p. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete  for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

TI  == coliforms associated with sugarcane plants and juices.
AB  == a study of the coliforms found on sugarcane plants throughout the growing season  indicated that members of the genus aerobacter comprise a part of the epiphytic microflora. when quantitative determinations were made of the coliforms by means  of the most probable number technique, no completed tests were obtained on young  sugarcane plants during the test period of february through may; however, paracolobactrum aerogenoides was isolated frequently. nine different imvic types  of coliforms were identified among the 198 isolates chosen for study. the predominating coliform found at the top, middle, and bottom portions of the sugarcane plants was a. cloacae, but the type predominating in leaf-sheath water  was a. aerogenes. only once was escherichia coli found associated with the plants at the high dilutions necessary for determining most probable numbers. the numbers of different coliforms occurring in sugarcane juice were generally divided equally among a. aerogenes, a. cloacae, and e. coli. more variety among the imvic types seemed to occur on the cane plants than in the leaf-sheath water  or the cane juice in the mill.
