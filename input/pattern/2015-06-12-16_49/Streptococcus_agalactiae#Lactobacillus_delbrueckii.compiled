TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases encoded by the genes prtB of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, prtH of Lactobacillus helveticus, prtP of Lactococcus lactis, scpA of Streptococcus pyogenes and csp of Streptococcus agalactiae have been compared using multiple sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and database homology searching methods. This comparative analysis has led to the prediction of a number of different domains in these cell-envelope proteinases, and their homology, characteristics and putative function are described. These domains include, starting from the N-terminus, a pre-pro-domain for secretion and activation, a serine protease domain (with a smaller inserted domain), two large middle domains A and B of unknown but possibly regulatory function, a helical spacer domain, a hydrophilic cell-wall spacer or attachment domain, and a cell-wall anchor domain. Not all domains are present in each cell-envelope proteinase, suggesting that these multi-domain proteins are the result of gene shuffling and domain swapping during evolution.
