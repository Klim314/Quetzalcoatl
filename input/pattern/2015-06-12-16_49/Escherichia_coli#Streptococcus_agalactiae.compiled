TI  - A Comparison of In-House Real-Time LAMP Assays with a Commercial Assay for the Detection of Pathogenic Bacteria.
AB  - Molecular detection of bacterial pathogens based on LAMP methods is a faster and  simpler approach than conventional culture methods. Although different LAMP-based methods for pathogenic bacterial detection are available, a systematic comparison of these different LAMP assays has not been performed. In this paper, we compared 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays with a commercialized kit (Isothermal Master Mix) for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157, E. coli O26, E. coli O45, E. coli O103, E. coli O111, E. coli O121, E. coli O145 and Streptococcus agalactiae. False-positive results were observed in all 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays, while all the negative controls of Isothermal Master Mix remained negative after amplification. The detection limit of Isothermal Master Mix for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157, E. coli O26, E. coli O45, E. coli O103, E. coli O111, E. coli O121 and Streptococcus agalactiae was 1 pg, whereas the sensitivity of the commercialized kit for E. coli O145 was 100 pg. In conclusion, the 12 in-house real-time LAMP assays were impractical to use, while the commercialized kit Isothermal Master Mix was useful for the detection of most bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Selecting anti-microbial treatment of aerobic vaginitis.
AB  - Aerobic vaginitis (AV) is a vaginal infectious condition which is often confused  with bacterial vaginosis (BV) or with the intermediate microflora as diagnosed by Nugent's method to detect BV on Gram-stained specimens. However, although both conditions reflect a state of lactobacillary disruption in the vagina, leading to an increase in pH, BV and AV differ profoundly. While BV is a noninflammatory condition composed of a multiplex array of different anaerobic bacteria in high quantities, AV is rather sparely populated by one or two enteric commensal flora bacteria, like Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylocuccus aureus, or Escherichia coli. AV is typically marked by either an increased inflammatory response or by prominent signs of epithelial atrophy or both. The latter condition, if severe, is also called desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. As AV is per exclusionem diagnosed by wet mount microscopy, it is a mistake to treat just vaginal culture results. Vaginal cultures only serve as follow-up data in clinical research projects and are at most used in clinical practice to confirm the diagnosis or exclude Candida infection. AV requires treatment based on microscopy findings and a combined local treatment with any of the following which may yield the best results: antibiotic (infectious component), steroids (inflammatory component), and/or estrogen (atrophy component). In cases with Candida present on microscopy or culture, antifungals must be tried first in order to see if other treatment is still needed. Vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide rapid relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Local antibiotics most suitable are preferably non-absorbed and broad spectrum, especially those covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, like kanamycin. To achieve rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms, oral therapy with amoxyclav or moxifloxacin can be used, especially in deep dermal vulvitis and colpitis infections with group B streptococci or (methicillin resistant) Staphylococcus aureus. Since the latter colonizations are frequent, but seldom inflammatory infections, we in general discourage the use of oral antibiotics in women with AV. In cases with a severe atrophy component (more than 10 % of epithelial cells are of the parabasal type), local estrogens can be used; and in postmenopausal or breast cancer patients with a contraindication for estrogens, even a combination of probiotics with an ultra-low dose of local estriol may be considered.
TI  - beta-Defensin in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus): Sequence, tissue expression, and anti-bacterial activity of synthetic peptides.
AB  - Beta-defensins (beta-defensins) are small cationic amphiphilic peptides that are  widely distributed in plants, insects, and vertebrates, and are important for their antimicrobial properties. In this study, the beta-defensin (Onbeta-defensin) gene of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was cloned from spleen tissue. Onbeta-defensin has a genomic DNA sequence of 674bp and produces a cDNA of 454bp. Sequence alignments showed that Onbeta-defensin contains three exons and two introns. Sequence analysis of the cDNA identified an open reading frame of 201bp, encoding 66 amino acids. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Onbeta-defensin encodes a cytoplasmic protein molecule containing a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of this peptide contains six conserved cysteine residues and two conserved glycine residues, and shows 81.82% and 78.33% sequence similarities with beta-defensin-1 of fugu (Takifugu rubripes) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the level of Onbeta-defensin expression was highest in the skin (307.1-fold), followed by the spleen (77.3-fold), kidney (17.8-fold), and muscle (16.5-fold) compared to controls. By contrast, low levels of expression were found in the liver, heart, intestine, stomach, and gill (<3.0-fold). Artificial infection of tilapia with Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS] strain) resulted in a significantly upregulated expression of Onbeta-defensin in the skin, muscle, kidney, and gill. In vitro antimicrobial experiments showed that a synthetic Onbeta-defensin polypeptide had a certain degree of inhibitory effect on the growth of Escherichia coli DH5alpha and S. agalactiae. The results indicate that Onbeta-defensin plays a role in immune responses that suppress or kill pathogens.
TI  - [Profile and susceptibility to antibiotics in urinary tract infections in children and newborns from 2012 to 2013: Data from 1879 urine cultures].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We present recent data on the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogenic bacteria isolated in children and newborns in our region over the past 2years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study on the positive urine cultures from pediatric and neonatal populations during 2012-2013. Bacteria were identified using conventional methods. Susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted as recommended by the committee of the susceptibility of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM). RESULTS: We collected 1879 non-redundant bacteria with more than 73% Escherichia coli. Children and infants (mean age, 32months [range, 1month to 14years]) accounted for 84% of the bacteria collected and newborns (mean age, 12days [range, 1day to 1month]) 16%. A female predominance was observed in the pediatric population (M:F sex ratio, 3.2), whereas for the neonatal population, the proportions were almost identical in both sexes (M:F sex ratio, 1.1). Most of the positive urine cultures (n=1234) were from the community. Hospitalized patients (n=636) were divided into pediatric (60%) and neonatal units (40%). Five bacterial genera dominated the bacteriological profile: E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp., and Enterococcus. The susceptibility of the main BUP antibiotics used for treatment of frequent UTI showed the effectiveness of furadoine, imipenem, fosfomycin, and colistin. Amoxicillin kept constant activity against Enterococcus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The rates of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam antibiotics were high, especially in the neonatal population. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was noted in 12.8% of pediatric Enterobacteria vs. 22.6% of the neonatal strains. For community Enterobacteriaceae, the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics was limited with 11.2% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (C3G), including 8.6% ESBL production. CONCLUSION: The impact of widespread use of beta-lactam antibiotics in neonatal and pediatric environments is felt. Colistin, imipenem, and fosfomycin are the most frequently used antibiotics active against bacteria responsible for neonatal and pediatric UTI; however, they cannot be used as probabilistic treatment. Nitrofurans seem to be active antibiotics on UTI, but they present limits in their use in neonatal and pediatric populations. Their indication in case of pyelonephritis should be discussed.
TI  - A C-type lectin from Bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts Staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. Staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. Several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of Bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against S. aureus NRS155. Crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against S. aureus. Biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. Two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were also assayed against S. epidermidis NRS101. Fraction 15 was identified by TripleTOF mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding C-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kDa. The lectin was purified from the crude venom by D-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. This pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of S. aureus and S. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. The lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. The antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. A pre-formed S. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the C-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. chromogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Escherichia coli. These findings reveal a new activity for C-type lectins. Studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.
TI  - Effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by animal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance toward quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) is widespread  among a diverse range of microorganisms and is facilitated by several mechanisms such as biofilm formation. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by some field isolates of animal bacterial pathogens were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella serotypes, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (10 isolates of each) were examined for effects of benzalkonium chloride on biofilm formation and planktonic growth using microtiter plates. For all the examined strains in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of disinfectant. RESULTS: The means of strains growth increase after the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) were significant in all the bacteria (except for E. coli in 1/32 and S. agalactiae in of 1/8 MIC). Biofilm formation increased with decrease of antiseptics concentration; a significant increase was found in all the samples. The most turbidity related to S. aureus and the least to Salmonella. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance against quaternary ammonium compounds is increasing which can increase the bacterial biofilm formation.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.
TI  - An homolog of the Frz Phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphoTransferase System  of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli is encoded on a genomic island in specific lineages of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - We identified a Streptococcus agalactiae metabolic region (fru2) coding for a Phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphoTransferase System (PTS) homologous to the Frz system of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. The Frz system is involved in environmental sensing and regulation of the expression of adaptation and virulence genes in E. coli. The S. agalactiae fru2 region codes three subunits of a PTS transporter of the fructose-mannitol family, a transcriptional activator of PTSs of the MtlR family, an allulose-6 phosphate-3-epimerase, a transaldolase and a transketolase. We demonstrated that all these genes form an operon. The fru2 operon is present in a 17494-bp genomic island. We analyzed by multilocus sequence typing a population of 492 strains representative of the S. agalactiae population and we showed that the presence of the fru2 operon is linked to the phylogeny of S. agalactiae. The fru2 operon is always present within strains of clonal complexes CC 1, CC 7, CC 10, CC 283 and singletons ST 130 and ST 288, but never found in other CCs and STs. Our results indicate that the fru2 operon was acquired during the evolution of the S. agalactiae species from a common ancestor before the divergence of CC 1, CC 7, CC 10, CC 283, ST 130 and ST 288. As S. agalactiae strains of CC 1 and CC 10 are frequently isolated from adults with invasive disease, we hypothesize that the S. agalactiae Fru2 system senses the environment to allow the bacterium to adapt to new conditions encountered during the infection of adults.
TI  - Reduction of Lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. The mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (SCC). Although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk SCC, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, Lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and SCC have not been determined previously. Thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. The overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. The Lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative PCR. Mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. Based on comparison with the pairwise Mann-Whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (P=0.0175), but lower E. coli (P=0.0002), S. aureus (P<0.0001), S. agalactiae (P=0.0001) and T. pyogenes (P=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. The negative correlation between Lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the SCC, was confirmed with Spearman correlation analysis. Data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between Lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.
TI  - Microbiology of Pelvic Lymphocyst Infection after Lymphadenectomy for Malignant Gynecologic Tumors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. Although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. The purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between October 2002 and March 2013. The participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. Computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. RESULTS: During the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors, and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. Cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus (three patients), S. epidermidis (one patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), Enterococcus (two patients), Escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). They were all monomicrobial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study and other smaller ones suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. These bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein and Peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in the neonatal period. STUDY DESIGN: Breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. Concentrations of lactoferrin, LL-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of AMPs. Samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent LOS were compared for levels of AMPs and inhibition of bacterial growth. RESULTS: Levels of most AMPs and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. Lactoferrin was the only AMP that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. Levels of AMPs were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without LOS, however, infants who developed LOS consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk AMPs than those who were free from LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations of lactoferrin and defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.
TI  - Metabolic fate of unsaturated glucuronic/iduronic acids from glycosaminoglycans:  molecular identification and structure determination of streptococcal isomerase and dehydrogenase.
AB  - Glycosaminoglycans in mammalian extracellular matrices are degraded to their constituents, unsaturated uronic (glucuronic/iduronic) acids and amino sugars, through successive reactions of bacterial polysaccharide lyase and unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase. Genes coding for glycosaminoglycan-acting lyase, unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, and the phosphotransferase system are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococci and clostridia. Here, we studied the streptococcal metabolic pathway of unsaturated uronic acids and the structure/function relationship of its relevant isomerase and dehydrogenase. Two proteins (gbs1892 and gbs1891) of Streptococcus agalactiae strain NEM316 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. 4-Deoxy-l-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate (Dhu) nonenzymatically generated from unsaturated uronic acids was converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate via 3-deoxy-d-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate through successive reactions of gbs1892 isomerase (DhuI) and gbs1891 NADH-dependent reductase/dehydrogenase (DhuD). DhuI and DhuD enzymatically corresponded to 4-deoxy-l-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase (KduI) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate dehydrogenase (KduD), respectively, involved in pectin metabolism, although no or low sequence identity was observed between DhuI and KduI or between DhuD and KduD, respectively. Genes for DhuI and DhuD were found to be included in the streptococcal genetic cluster, whereas KduI and KduD are encoded in clostridia. Tertiary and quaternary structures of DhuI and DhuD were determined by x-ray crystallography. Distinct from KduI beta-barrels, DhuI adopts an alpha/beta/alpha-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to that of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase. The structure of DhuD is unable to accommodate the substrate/cofactor, suggesting that conformational changes are essential to trigger enzyme catalysis. This is the first report on the bacterial metabolism of glycosaminoglycan-derived unsaturated uronic acids by isomerase and dehydrogenase.
TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Effects of cathode design parameters on in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of electrically-activated silver-based iontophoretic system.
AB  - Post-operative infection is a major risk associated with implantable devices. Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ionic silver as an alternative to antibiotic-based infection prophylaxis and treatment. The focus of this study is on an electrically activated implant system engineered for active release of antimicrobial silver ions. The objective was to evaluate the effects of the cathode design, especially the cathode material, on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the system. A modified Kirby-Bauer diffusion technique was used for the antimicrobial efficacy evaluations (24 h testing interval). In phase-1 of the study, a three-way ANOVA (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was performed to determine the effects of cathode material (silver, titanium, and stainless steel), cathode surface area and electrode separation distance on the efficacy of the system against Staphylococcus aureus. The results show that within the design space tested, none of these parameters had a statistically significant effect on the antimicrobiality of the system (P > 0.15). Subsequently, one-way ANOVA (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was conducted in phase-2 to validate the inference regarding the non-significance of the cathode material to the system efficacy using a broader spectrum of pathogens (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Aspergillus flavus) responsible for osteomyelitis. The results confirmed the lack of statistical difference between efficacies of the three cathode material configurations against all pathogens tested (P > 0.58). Overall, the results demonstrate the ability to alter the cathode material and related design parameters in order to minimize the silver usage in the system without adversely affecting its antimicrobial efficacy.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. Two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. In experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip A: 1% H2O2; dip B: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip C: 1% iodophor; and dip D: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. Four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. In experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip A; dip D; and dip E: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. Experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Species differences were also found where Mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. Experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips D and E and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. No differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip A. It can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. Furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for H2O2 dips may be optimal in reducing pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. A reduction in premilking teat dip contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.
TI  - Inducible expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein by interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-1beta and Toll-like receptor 2 promoters in goat mammary epithelial cells in response to bacterial challenges.
AB  - The development of a bacteria-inducible expression system has several advantages  compared with persistent expression of anti-bacterial proteins in milk to prevent and treat mastitis. The present study determined whether mastitis responsive promoters could regulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) in response to challenges with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. The level of expression of interleukin (IL)-1alpha was significantly increased in GMECs challenged with E. coli, S. aureus or S. agalactiae compared with untreated GMECs. IL-1beta was induced by E. coli and S. aureus, while Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was induced by E. coli only. GMECs were transfected with IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and TLR2 promoter-EGFP reporter gene lentiviral expression vectors and the levels of expression of EGFP were measured by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis after bacterial challenge. EGFP expression driven by the IL-1alpha and IL-1beta promoters was higher in GMECs challenged with E. coli, S. aureus or S. agalactiae than in untreated GMECs. There were no differences in EGFP expression driven by the TLR2 promoter between GMECs challenged with S. aureus or S. agalactiae and untreated GMECs, but EGFP expression was significantly increased in GMECs challenged with E. coli. Overall, these results indicate that the promoters of some bacteria-inducible genes can regulate EGFP expression in GMECs in response to bacterial challenges. This bacteria-inducible expression strategy could be used for production of mastitis resistant animals by regulating the expression of anti-bacterial proteins in the mammary gland.
TI  - Prevalence and predictors of bacterial meningitis in young infants with fever without a source.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Classical criteria differ when performing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in infants younger than 90 days with fever without a source (FWS). Our objectives were to analyze the prevalence and microbiology of bacterial meningitis in this group and its prevalence in relation to clinical and laboratory risk factors. METHODS: This is a substudy of a prospective registry including all infants of this age with FWS seen between September 2003 and August 2013 in a Pediatric Emergency Department of a Tertiary Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: Lumbar puncture was performed in 639 (27.0%) of the 2362 infants with FWS seen, the rate being higher in not well-appearing infants [60.9% vs. 25.7%; odds ratio (OR), 4.49] and in those </=21 days old (70.1% vs. 20.4%; OR, 9.14). Eleven infants were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis: 9 were </=21 days old (prevalence 2.8% vs. 0.1%; OR, 30.42) and 5 were not well-appearing infants (5.7% vs. 0.2%; OR, 23.06). Bacteria isolated were Streptococcus agalactiae (3), Escherichia coli (3), Listeria monocytogenes (3), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and Neisseria meningitidis (1). None of the 1975 well-appearing infants >21 days old were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, regardless of whether biomarkers were altered. CONCLUSIONS: In infants younger than 90 days with FWS, performing CSF analysis for ruling out bacterial meningitis must be strongly considered in not well-appearing infants and in those </=21 days old. The recommendation of systematically performing CSF analysis in well-appearing infants 22-90 days of age on the basis of analytical criteria alone must be reevaluated.
TI  - Incidence of invasive group B streptococcal disease and pathogen genotype distribution in newborn babies in the Netherlands over 25 years: a nationwide surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group B streptococcus is the most common cause of neonatal infections. We studied the clinical and molecular epidemiology of invasive group B streptococcus infection in children younger than 3 months in the Netherlands over 25 years. We assessed the effect of the Dutch guidelines, introduced in 1999, for prevention of group B streptococcus, consisting of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis during labour in cases of premature labour, prolonged rupture of membranes, or fever during delivery. METHODS: We did this nationwide surveillance study with data from 1987 to 2011, from the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis. We included data for patients aged 3 months or younger with positive blood culture or cerebrospinal fluid culture for group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli infection. Early onset was defined as less than 7 days after birth and late onset was defined as 7 or more days after birth. We did multilocus sequence typing of a random subset of group B streptococcus samples to assess changes in sequence type (Mann-Kendall trend test) and the distribution of clonal complexes (chi(2) and Fisher exact test) before the introduction of prevention guidelines (1987-99) and afterwards (2000-11). We compared incidences and the distribution of clonal complexes before and after the introduction of guidelines. FINDINGS: Most cases of group B streptococcus had early onset (696/1075; 65%). The incidence of invasive group B streptococcus infection increased from 0.20 per 1000 livebirths in 1987, to 0.32 per 1000 livebirths in 2011 (p<0.0001). The incidence of early-onset disease increased from 0.11 per 1000 livebirths to 0.19 per 1000 livebirths (p<0.0001). The incidence of invasive Escherichia coli infection was 0.05 in 1987, and 0.16 in 2011 (p=0.17). Early-onset group B streptococcus infection caused by isolates belonging to clonal complex 17 was more common in the post-implementation period than in the pre-implementation period (p=0.002). INTERPRETATION: The introduction of prevention guidelines for invasive group B streptococcus disease in 1999 did not reduce the incidence of disease in neonates. The guidelines should be reassessed and alternative approaches to prevent infant invasive group B streptococcus disease should be sought.

TI  - The salivary scavenger and agglutinin in early life: diverse roles in amniotic fluid and in the infant intestine.
AB  - The salivary scavenger and agglutinin (SALSA), also known as gp340 and dmbt1, is  an antimicrobial and inflammation-regulating molecule located at the mucosal surfaces. The present study revealed that SALSA was present in the amniotic fluid (AF) and exceptionally enriched in both meconium and feces of infants. Based on immunological and mass spectrometric analysis, SALSA was estimated to constitute up to 4-10% of the total protein amount in meconium, making it one of the most abundant proteins. SALSA proteins in the AF and intestinal samples were polymorphic and exhibited varying polypeptide compositions. In particular, a different abundance of peptides corresponding to functionally important structures was found in the AF and intestinal SALSA. The AF form of SALSA had a more intact structure and contained peptides from the zona pellucida domain, which is involved in cell differentiation and oligomerization. In contrast, the intestinal SALSA was more enriched with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. The AF, but not the meconium SALSA, bound to Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. gordonii, and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, differential binding was observed also to known endogenous ligands C1q, mannose-binding lectin, and secretory IgA. Our results have thus identified mucosal body compartments, where SALSA is particularly abundant, and suggest that SALSA exhibits varying functions in the different mucosal locations. The high levels of SALSA in AF and the infant intestine suggest a robust and important function for SALSA during the fetal development and in the mucosal innate immune defense of infants.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Bacteremia in previously healthy children in emergency departments: clinical and  microbiological characteristics and outcome.
AB  - A blood culture (BC) is frequently requested in both patients with a suspected occult bacteremia/invasive infection as well as those with certain focal infections. Few data are available on the characteristics of patients in whom a bacteremia is identified in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED). A prospective multicenter registry was established by the Spanish Pediatric Emergency Society. Epidemiological data, complementary test results, clinical management, and final outcome were recorded. Data from the first three years of the registry were analyzed. A true bacterial pathogen grew in 932 of 65,169 BCs collected [1.43 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.34-1.51 %], with 711 of them collected in patients without previously known bacteremia risk factors. Among them, 335 (47.1 %) were younger than 1 year old and 467 (65.7 %) had a normal Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) on admission. Overall, the most frequently isolated bacterial species was Streptococcus pneumoniae (27.3 %; 47.6 % among patients with an altered PAT). The main pathogens were Escherichia coli (40.3 %) and S. agalactiae (35.7 %) among patients younger than 3 months, S. pneumoniae among patients 3-60 months old (40.0 %), and S. aureus (31.9 %) among patients over 60 months of age. Neisseria meningitidis was the leading cause of sepsis in patients older than 3 months. Eight patients died; none of them had a pneumococcal bacteremia and all had abnormal PAT findings on admission. S. pneumoniae is the main cause of bacteremia in patients without bacteremia risk factors who attended Spanish PEDs. Age and general appearance influence the frequency of each bacterial species. General appearance also influences the associated mortality.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of recombinant Siganus oramin L-amino acid oxidase expressed in Pichia pastoris.
AB  - Siganus oraminl-amino acid oxidase is a novel natural protein (named SR-LAAO) isolated from serum of the rabbitfish (S. oramin), which showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and had a lethal effect on the parasites Cryptocaryon irritans, Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. In order to test whether recombinant SR-LAAO (rSR-LAAO) produced by the eukaryotic expression system also has antimicrobial activity, the yeast Pichia pastoris was used as the expression host to obtain rSR-LAAO in vitro. Crude rSR-LAAO produced by P. pastoris integrated with the SR-LAAO gene had antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as shown by inhibition zone assay of the antibacterial spectrum on agar plates. The average diameter of the inhibition zone of crude rSR-LAAO against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was 1.040 +/- 0.045 cm and 1.209 +/- 0.085 cm, respectively. For the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sobria, Escherichia coli, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio cholera and Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, the average diameter of inhibition zone was 1.291 +/- 0.089 cm, 0.943 +/- 0.061 cm, 0.756 +/- 0.057 cm, 0.834 +/- 0.023 cm and 1.211 +/- 0.026 cm, respectively. These results were obtained at the logarithmic growth phase of S. agalactiae and A. sobria cell suspensions after incubation with 0.5 mg/mL crude rSR-LAAO for 24 h. The final bacterial growth rate was decreased significantly. The relative inhibition rate can reach 50% compared to crude products from P. pastoris integrated with an empty vector at the same concentration of protein. The antimicrobial activity of crude rSR-LAAO was likely associated with H2O2 formation, because its inhibition zones were disturbed significantly by catalase. Scanning electron microscopy results showed crude rSR-LAAO-treated bacterial surfaces became rough and particles were attached, cell walls were retracted and cell membranes were ruptured. Together, the results of this study indicated rSR-LAAO from the P. pastoris expression system is a potential antibiotic for application as a therapeutic agent against bacterial diseases.
TI  - Phosphoglycerate kinase enhanced immunity of the whole cell of Streptococcus agalactiae in tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a Gram-positive bacterium and a severe aquaculture pathogen that can infect a wide range of warmwater fish species. The outer-surface proteins in bacterial pathogens play an important role in pathogenesis. We evaluated the immunogenicity of two of the identified surface proteins namely phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and ornithine carbamoyl-transferase (OCT). PGK and OCT were over-expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and used as the subunit vaccines in tilapia. Tilapia immunized with the S. agalactiae modified bacteria vaccine (whole cell preparations with recombinant PGK and OCT proteins) individually were tested for the efficacy. OCT and PGK combined with WC had a higher survival rate. A high-level protection and significant specific antibody responses against S. agalactiae challenge was observed upon the vaccinated tilapia with the purified PGK protein and S. agalactiae whole cells. The specific antibody titer against S. agalactiae antigen suggested that increased antibody titers were correlated with post-challenge survival rate. Il-1beta expression profile was higher in PGK + WC-treated group. Tnf-alpha expression in the PGK + WC group was significantly increased. Taken together, our results suggested the combinations of recombinant protein and whole cell may elicit immune responses that reach greater protection than that of individual S. agalactiae components.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - [Practical management of neonatal sepsis risk in term or near-term infants].
AB  - Incidence of neonatal early-onset sepsis has dramatically declined in France from 0.65 to 0.23 per thousand live births in 10 years since national guidelines to detect and treat intrapartum women with group B streptococcus colonization have been adopted. However, neonatal early-onset sepsis continues to be a common healthcare burden. Group B streptococcus (GBS) remains the leading cause of bacterial infection in term or near-term infants. As a result of prevention strategies, approximately 30% of pregnant women and more than 2% of newborns are treated with systemic antibiotics. Concerns have been expressed about the safety of wide use of antibiotics such as antibiotic resistance, emergence of Escherichia coli infections, and long-term side effects due to gut microbiota modifications. New recommendations from the Centers of Disease Control in the United States and from European countries aim at improving GBS detection methods, updating algorithms for GBS intrapartum chemoprophylaxis in pregnant women, defining high-risk newborns more efficiently, and limiting biological evaluation in low-risk newborns.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  - The diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. Detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by PCR would provide a much more timely result. Unfortunately, PCR-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. Therefore we developed a real-time multiplex PCR assay tailored to LOS diagnosis which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. Species-specific PCR assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. The PCR assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (LOD) of </=10CFUeq./reaction. These LOD values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial DNA was isolated from blood. Clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex PCR and blood culture. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex PCR that allows the direct detection of the most important bacterial pathogens causing LOS in preterm infants.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus agalactiae NEM316.
AB  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an essential enzyme involved  in glycolysis. Despite lacking the secretory signal sequence, this cytosolic enzyme has been found localized at the surface of several bacteria and fungi. As a surface protein, GAPDH exhibits various adhesive functions, thereby facilitating colonization and invasion of host tissues. Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B streptococcus (GBS), binds onto the host using its surface adhesins and causes sepsis and pneumonia in neonates. GAPDH is one of the surface adhesins of GBS binding to human plasminogen and is a virulent factor associated with host colonization. Although the surface-associated GAPDH has been shown to bind to a variety of host extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in various bacteria, the molecular mechanism underlying their interaction is not fully understood. To investigate this, structural studies on GAPDH of S. agalactiae were initiated. The gapC gene of S. agalactiae NEM316 encoding GAPDH protein was cloned into pET-28a vector, overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified to homogeneity. The purified protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The GAPDH crystals obtained in two different crystallization conditions diffracted to 2.8 and 2.6 A resolution, belonging to two different space groups P2(1) and P2(1)2(1)2(1), respectively. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and structure refinement is now in progress.
TI  - Silver sucrose octasulfate (IASOS) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  - This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with a substituted thiadiazole moiety as potent drug-resistant bacteria inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thiadiazole moieties were  synthesized via acylation reactions under mild conditions. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by the agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. The majority of the tested compounds displayed moderate antibacterial activities. Importantly, the three compounds with amino or tertiary amine groups in their side chains, 11, 13b, and 15c, were the most active antibacterial agents. Docking experiments carried out on the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA proved that there is a reasonable direct correlation between the binding free energy (DeltaGb, kcal/mol) and the antibacterial activity. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 11 and 15c in rat were characterized by moderate clearance and oral bioavailability.
TI  - Chlorhexidine digluconate effects on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in some field isolates of animal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study chlorhexidine digluconate disinfectant effects on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in some bacterial field isolates from animals. OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated chlorhexidine digluconate effects on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in some field isolates of veterinary bacterial pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella serotypes, Staphylococcus. aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (10 isolates for each) were examined for chlorhexidine digluconate effects on biofilm formation and planktonic growth using microtiter plates. In all of the examined strains in the presence of chlorhexidine digluconate, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of the disinfectant. RESULTS: Chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the planktonic growth of different bacterial species at sub-MICs. But they were able to induce biofilm development of the E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and Str. agalactiae strains. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance against chlorhexidine is increasing. Sub-MIC doses of chlorhexidine digluconate can stimulate the formation of biofilm strains.
TI  - Recent trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan--a country where Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugated vaccines have just been introduced.
AB  - To investigate the trends in incidence and the characteristics of bacterial meningitis in Japan where Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7) were introduced in 2008 and 2010, respectively, which was 5-20 years after their introduction in western countries. The nationwide Japanese survey of pediatric and neonatal bacterial meningitis was performed in 2011 and 2012. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical data, and compared the information obtained in the previous nationwide survey database. We also investigated the risk factors for disease outcome. In the 2011-2012 surveys, 357 patients were evaluated. H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli were the main organisms. The number of patients hospitalized with bacterial meningitis per 1000 admissions decreased from 1.31 in 2009 to 0.43 in 2012 (p < 0.001). The incidence of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae meningitis also decreased from 0.66 to 0.08 (p < 0.001), and 0.30 to 0.06 (p < 0.001), respectively. Only 0-2 cases with Neisseria meningitidis were reported each year throughout 2001-2012. The median patient age was 10-12 months in 2001-2011, and became lower in 2012 (2 month old) (p < 0.001). The fatality rate for S. agalactiae is the highest (5.9% (11/187)) throughout 2001-2012 among the four organisms. Risk factors for death and sequelae were convulsions at onset, low CSF glucose, S. agalactiae etiology, and persistent positive CSF culture. Hib vaccine and PCV7 decreased the rate of bacterial meningitis. Earlier introduction of these vaccines may have prevented bacterial meningitis among Japanese children.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Identification of a C-type lectin with antiviral and antibacterial activity from  pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.
AB  - C-type lectins (CTLs) play crucial roles in innate immune responses in invertebrates by recognizing and eliminating microinvaders. In this study, a CTL from pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (LvCTL3) was identified. LvCTL3 contains a single C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), which shows similarities to those of other shrimp CTLs and has a mutated 'EPD' motif in Ca(2+)-binding site 2. LvCTL3 mRNA can be detected in all tested tissues and expression of LvCTL3 in gills was up-regulated after Lipopolysaccharides, poly (I:C), Vibrio parahaemolyticus and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenges, suggesting activation responses of LvCTL3 to bacterial, virus and immune stimulant challenges. The 5'flanking regulatory region of LvCTL3 was cloned and we identified a NF-kappaB binding motif in the LvCTL3 promoter region. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that over-expression of L. vannamei dorsal can dramatically up regulate the promoter activity of LvCTL3, suggesting that LvCTL3 expression could be regulated through NF-kappaB signaling pathway. As far as we know, this is the first report on signaling pathway involve in shrimp CTLs expression. The recombinant LvCTL3 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The purified LvCTL3 can agglutinate Gram-negative microbe Vibrio alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus and Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis in the presence of calcium ions, but cannot agglutinate Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae. The agglutination activity of LvCTL3 was abolished when Ca(2+) was chelated with EDTA, suggesting the function of LvCTL3 is Ca(2+)-dependent. In vivo challenge experiments showed that the recombinant LvCTL3 protein can significantly reduce the mortalities of V. parahemolyticus and WSSV infection, indicating LvCTL3 might play significant roles in shrimp innate immunity defense against bacterial and viral infection.
TI  - Evaluation of the Minnesota Easy Culture System II Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate for identification of common mastitis pathogens in milk.
AB  - The objective of this study was to validate use of the Minnesota Easy Culture System II Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate (University of Minnesota Laboratory for Udder Health, St. Paul) to identify common mastitis pathogens in milk. A total of 283 quarter and composite milk samples submitted to the University of Minnesota Laboratory for Udder Health during the spring of 2010 were cultured simultaneously using 3 methods: standard laboratory culture (reference method) and the Minnesota Easy Culture System II Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate methods. Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate cultures were incubated for 18 to 24h and interpreted by 2 independent, untrained readers within 5h of each other. An experienced technician completed the standard laboratory culture. For each sample, all 3 study personnel recorded the culture result (yes/no) for each of the following diagnostic categories: no bacterial growth (NG), mixed (2 organisms), contaminated (3 or more organisms), gram-positive (GP), gram-negative (GN), Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and other. For each category, the prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values of a positive and negative test were calculated, and the agreement between readers and between each reader and the laboratory was assessed. Specificity, overall accuracy, and negative predictive values were generally high (>80%) for the Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate for each category. Sensitivity and positive predictive values were intermediate (>60%) or high (>80%) for the broad categories of NG, GP, GN, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and for Staph. aureus, but were generally lower (<60%) for other more specific categories. Similarly, interreader agreement (kappa value) was moderate to substantial (40-80%) for the broad categories of NG, GP, GN, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and for Staph. aureus and E. coli, but was lower for other categories. The Tri-Plate had a higher sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value for Streptococcus spp., and higher interreader agreement for some of the more specific categories. Our conclusion was that Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate results will be most reliable when used to classify infections in broad diagnostic categories such NG, GP, or GN. The Bi-Plate and Tri-Plate will have intermediate ability to identify infections as being caused by Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., or Staph. aureus.
TI  - Vaginal infections among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. This study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between August and December 2008 at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct Gram smear, Nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS program version 12.0.1. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, BV was detected in 49.8%, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and Candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). Higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). No significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and C. trachomatis infections was found. Gentamicin was the most active agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarythromycin was the most active against Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. Such cases may require specific medication. Routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.
TI  - Antibacterial Activities and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory (Membrane Stability) Properties of Methanolic Extracts of Gardenia coronaria Leaves.
AB  - This work is carried out with Gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family Rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. Leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. The leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. Methanol extract from the leaves of Gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. The lower concentrations of Methanolic leaf extract of Gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with Kanamycin. The crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of Aspirin as positive control. The Methanolic extracts of Gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Shigella sonnei, Shigella boydii, and Proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. The extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.
TI  - Investigation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Bacillus licheniformis Strains Isolated from Retail Powdered Infant Milk Formulae.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of ten Bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail infant milk formulae against a range of indicator (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Listeria innocua) and clinically relevant (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli) microorganisms. Deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all B. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive target organisms. PCR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the B. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. The remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. Further analyses identified a peptide of ~1,422 Da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. N-terminal sequencing of the ~1,422 Da peptide from one strain identified it as ILPEITXIFHD. This peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by Bacillus spp. Subsequent PCR analyses demonstrated that the six B. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that the ~1,422 Da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.
TI  - Sepsis from the gut: the enteric habitat of bacteria that cause late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Late-onset sepsis is a major problem in neonatology, but the habitat  of the pathogens before bloodstream invasion occurs is not well established. METHODS: We examined prospectively collected stools from premature infants with sepsis to find pathogens that subsequently invaded their bloodstreams, and sought the same organisms in stools of infants without sepsis. Culture-based techniques were used to isolate stool bacteria that provisionally matched the bloodstream organisms, which were then genome sequenced to confirm or refute commonality. RESULTS: Of 11 children with late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections, 7 produced at least 1 stool that contained group B Streptococcus (GBS), Serratia marcescens, or Escherichia coli before their sepsis episode with provisionally matching organisms. Of 96 overlap comparison subjects without sepsis temporally associated with these cases, 4 were colonized with provisionally matching GBS or S. marcescens. Of 175 comparisons of stools from randomly selected infants without sepsis, 1 contained a GBS (this infant had also served as an overlap comparison subject and both specimens contained provisionally matching GBS). Genome sequencing confirmed common origin of provisionally matching fecal and blood isolates. The invasive E. coli were present in all presepticemic stools since birth, but gut colonization with GBS and S. marcescens occurred closer to time of bloodstream infection. CONCLUSIONS: The neonatal gut harbors sepsis-causing pathogens, but such organisms are not inevitable members of the normal microbiota. Surveillance microbiology, decolonization, and augmented hygiene might prevent dissemination of invasive bacteria between and within premature infants.
TI  - Prospective analysis of risk factors associated with group B streptococcal colonisation in neonates born at a tertiary care centre in India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial colonisation of neonates and the birth canal by group B streptococci (GBS) plays a significant role in the development of neonatal infections. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of GBS colonisation in neonates in the first 48 hours of life and to identify the risk factors associated with GBS colonisation. METHODS: To estimate GBS colonisation, a prospective cross-sectional analysis of 1050 neonates delivered at a tertiary care hospital in India was undertaken. Swabs were taken from the neonates' skin and/or mucus membranes of the external ear canal, anterior nares, umbilicus, throat and ano-rectal sites between 24 and 48 hours of age. Data regarding the various risk factors were collected on a predesigned performa. RESULTS: 338 (32.2%) of 1050 neonates had bacterial colonisation. Escherichia coli (25.9%), was the bacteria most commonly isolated, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (16.3%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CONS) (12.6%). The overall rate of GBS colonisation was 3.23%. Preterm birth, respiratory distress at birth, prolonged rupture of membranes (>==18 hrs), intrapartum antibiotics, underlying medical illness in the mother, prolonged labour, maternal fever and other obstetric complications were identified as significant risk factors associated with neonatal GBS colonisation (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Multi-centre and community-based studies in India are recommended to identify the true colonisation rates for GBS, and it is necessary to perform cultures from multiple body sites of neonates in order to obtain an accurate bacteriological evaluation.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates collected from complicated skin and skin structure infections and intra-abdominal infections in Africa and Middle East countries: TEST 2007-2012.
AB  - Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are problematic due to decreasing therapeutic options available against multidrug-resistant pathogens common among these types of infections. A total of 2245 isolates from African and the Middle Eastern (AfME) countries were collected to determine in vitro activity for tigecycline and comparators during 2007-2012 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation Surveillance Trial program. Tigecycline was launched in the AfME in 2007 and remains active against a wide range of targeted pathogens worldwide. Isolates were recovered from cSSSI (1990) and IAI (255) from 38 sites in 11 AfME countries. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common species from cSSSI (27.9%), and the methicillin-resistant S. aureus rate was 25%. Enterococcus spp. (7.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2.9%) were other common Gram-positive pathogens represented. Enterobacter spp. (14.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Escherichia coli (11.4%), Klebsiella spp. (10.9%), and Acinetobacter spp. (7.2 %) were the most common Gram-negative species collected. Tigecycline MIC(90) values were 0.25 mug/mL against S. aureus. E. coli and Enterobacter spp. had tigecycline MIC(90) values of 1 and 2 mug/mL, respectively. E. coli was the most frequently collected species from IAI (28.3%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (20.8%), Enterococcus spp. (11.8%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.3%). Isolates collected from IAI had the following tigecycline MIC(90) values: E. coli (1 mug/mL), Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae (2 mug/mL), Enterococcus spp. (0.25 mug/mL), and S. maltophilia (1 mug/mL). Tigecycline in vitro activity was observed against a broad spectrum of bacterial species, including strains resistant to other antimicrobial classes.
TI  - Evaluation of the effects of ultraviolet light on bacterial contaminants inoculated into whole milk and colostrum, and on colostrum immunoglobulin G.
AB  - Raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. According to the USDA, more than 58% of calves in the United States are fed unpasteurized milk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of UV light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum IgG. A pilot-scale UV light continuous (UVC) flow-through unit (45 J/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. Colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with Listeria innocua, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Salmonella serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with UVC. During UVC treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. The effect of UVC on IgG was evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. For each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and IgG was measured using ELISA. The UVC treatment of milk resulted in a significant final count (log cfu/mL) reduction of Listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), Escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), Staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/mL reduction), and A. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/mL) reduction for M. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/mL) of Listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), and Acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), but not of E. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), and Staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the IgG concentration, with an observed final mean IgG reduction of approximately 50%. Development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to IgG caused by manipulating colostrum.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - Trends in bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal meningitis in England and Wales 2004-11: an observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meningitis remains one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, yet there are few population-based studies on the epidemiology, causes, or trends over time in meningitis, especially in industrialised countries. Our aim was to do such a study using routinely reported data available in England and Wales. METHODS: In England and Wales, UK National Health Service hospitals routinely report laboratory-confirmed pathogens electronically to Public Health England. Records of all positive bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal results from cerebrospinal fluid or from blood cultures in patients with clinical meningitis were extracted for analysis. The percentage change in annual incidence was estimated using linear regression analysis of the log of the annual incidence. FINDINGS: During 2004-11, 7061 cases of meningitis were reported (mean annual incidence 1.62 per 100,000 people, 95% CI 1.58-1.66), including 2594 cases in children (37%). The incidence of bacterial (1.44 per 100,000 people, 1.41-1.48), fungal (0.09, 0.08-0.10), and mycobacterial (0.09, 0.08-0.09) meningitis remained stable overall and across the age groups, apart from significant year-on-year increases in children younger than 3 months (978 cases; incidence 72.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 7.4%, 5.1-9.8; p<0.0001) driven mainly by group B streptococci (GBS), and in adults aged 65 years or older (752 cases; incidence 1.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 3.0%, 1.4-4.8; p<0.0001) primarily because of Escherichia coli. By contrast, meningococcal meningitis rates declined steadily, but remained the most common cause of meningitis in children. Overall, five groups of bacteria accounted for 60% (3790/6286) of bacterial meningitis cases: Neisseria meningitidis (1350 cases, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1143, 18%), Staphylococcus aureus (652, 10%), GBS (326, 5%), and E coli (319, 5%). INTERPRETATION: In England and Wales, laboratory-based surveillance shows a remarkably stable incidence of bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial meningitis in recent years, although there were differences in individual trends among the main pathogens causing meningitis in different age groups. FUNDING: None.
TI  - A clinical review of maternal bacteremia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To carry out a 4-year review of cases of bacteremia among obstetric patients. METHODS: In a retrospective review, all cases of maternal bacteremia between 2009 and 2012 were identified from the laboratory database of Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. The clinical records of each case were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period, 37,584 obstetric patients attended the hospital. There were 58 cases of bacteremia: 19 were diagnosed prepartum, 20 intrapartum, and 19 postpartum. There were no maternal deaths. Two cases resulted in septic shock. Four cases were associated with early pregnancy loss, and 2 with stillbirth. Fifty-four cases occurred among 34,956 women who delivered a neonate weighing 500 g or more (0.15%). Escherichia coli most frequently caused prepartum and postpartum bacteremia, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae (beta-hemolytic, Lancefield group B) most frequently caused intrapartum bacteremia. There was no association between the development of bacteremia and maternal risk factors including employment status, obesity, parity, smoking status, and maternal age. Most organisms cultured were sensitive to first-line antibiotics; there were no cases of bacteremia caused by multi-drug resistant organisms. CONCLUSION: The incidence of maternal bacteremia in the study population was low and was usually associated with good maternal and fetal outcomes.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety.
AB  - Novel pleuromutilin derivatives designed based on the structure of valnemulin were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. These pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety exhibited excellent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Compound 5b showed the highest antibacterial activities and even exceeded tiamulin. Moreover, the docking experiments provided information about the binding model between the synthesized compounds and peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA.
TI  - The microbiology of bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis in children.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiology of secondary bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis and the appropriateness of current antimicrobial practice in one institution. METHODS: A 14-year retrospective single-centre study of 69 consecutive paediatric patients (age 1-14 years) with appendicitis-related peritonitis and positive peritoneal specimen cultures was conducted. Post-operative outcomes, microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of peritoneal isolates were analysed in all patients. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was identified in 56/69 (81 %) peritoneal specimens; four isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate, and one other isolate was resistant to gentamicin. Anaerobes were identified in 37/69 (54 %) peritoneal specimens; two anaerobic isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and one isolate was resistant to metronidazole. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 4/69 (6 %) peritoneal specimens, and all were susceptible to gentamicin. Streptococcal species (two Group F streptococci and three beta-haemolytic streptococci) were identified in 5/69 (7 %) specimens, and all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate. Combination therapy involving amoxicillin-clavulanate and aminoglycoside is appropriate empirical treatment in 68/69 (99 %) patients. Addition of metronidazole to this regime would provide 100 % initial empirical coverage. Inadequate initial empiric antibiotic treatment and the presence of amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant E. coli were independent predictors of the post-operative infectious complications observed in 14/69 (20 %) patients. CONCLUSION: E. coli and mixed anaerobes are the predominant organisms identified in secondary peritonitis from appendicitis in children. Inadequate initial empirical antibiotic and amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant E. coli may contribute to increased post-operative infectious complications. This study provides evidence-based information on choice of combination therapy for paediatric appendicitis-related bacterial peritonitis.
TI  - The impact of group B Streptococcus prophylaxis on early onset neonatal infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if changes have occurred in the causative pathogens and/or antibiotic susceptibility profiles in early onset neonatal infections since initiation of group B Streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis and to determine risk factors for ampicillin/penicillin resistant microorganisms. STUDY DESIGN: Data on 220 infants with positive blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid cultures for bacteria or fungi at </=seven days of age from 1990-2007 were examined and divided into three epochs, based on intrapartum antibiotic prophylactic (IAP) practices. Pathogens and antibiotic resistance were compared among epochs. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the incidence of GBS infections occurred over time, with no change in the incidence of other pathogens or the emergence of antibiotic resistance, including the very low-birthweight population. In regression analysis, ampicillin resistance was associated with male gender (OR 3.096). CONCLUSIONS: No emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens was found following IAP use. Changing microorganisms and increasing antibiotic resistance found in prior studies are likely multifactorial. Further study is needed to continue to reduce the rates of common early onset pathogens.
TI  - Voided midstream urine culture and acute cystitis in premenopausal women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cause of acute uncomplicated cystitis is determined on the basis  of cultures of voided midstream urine, but few data guide the interpretation of such results, especially when gram-positive bacteria grow. METHODS: Women from 18 to 49 years of age with symptoms of cystitis provided specimens of midstream urine, after which we collected urine by means of a urethral catheter for culture (catheter urine). We compared microbial species and colony counts in the paired specimens. The primary outcome was a comparison of positive predictive values and negative predictive values of organisms grown in midstream urine, with the presence or absence of the organism in catheter urine used as the reference. RESULTS: The analysis of 236 episodes of cystitis in 226 women yielded 202 paired specimens of midstream urine and catheter urine that could be evaluated. Cultures were positive for uropathogens in 142 catheter specimens (70%), 4 of which had more than one uropathogen, and in 157 midstream specimens (78%). The presence of Escherichia coli in midstream urine was highly predictive of bladder bacteriuria even at very low counts, with a positive predictive value of 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of 93% (Spearman's r=0.944). In contrast, in midstream urine, enterococci (in 10% of cultures) and group B streptococci (in 12% of cultures) were not predictive of bladder bacteriuria at any colony count (Spearman's r=0.322 for enterococci and 0.272 for group B streptococci). Among 41 episodes in which enterococcus, group B streptococci, or both were found in midstream urine, E. coli grew from catheter urine cultures in 61%. CONCLUSIONS: Cultures of voided midstream urine in healthy premenopausal women with acute uncomplicated cystitis accurately showed evidence of bladder E. coli but not of enterococci or group B streptococci, which are often isolated with E. coli but appear to rarely cause cystitis by themselves.

TI  - Epidemiology of bacteremia in febrile infants in the United States.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fever in infants is a common clinical dilemma. The objective of this  study was to present data from hospital systems across the northeast, southeast, mid-west, and western United States to identify the pathogens causing bacteremia in febrile infants admitted to general care units. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of positive blood culture results in febrile infants aged </=90 days admitted to a general care unit across 6 hospital systems. Data were collected from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2012 from emergency departments and general inpatient units. Cultures from ICUs, central lines, or infants who had complex comorbidities were excluded, as were repeat cultures positive for the same bacteria. Common contaminants were considered pathogens if they were treated as such. RESULTS: We identified 181 cases of bacteremia in 177 infants. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (42%), followed by group B Streptococcus (23%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely in older infants (P = .01). Non-low-risk bacteremic infants were more likely to have E. coli or group B Streptococcus than low-risk bacteremic infants. We identified no cases of Listeria monocytogenes. Variation between sites was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest and most geographically diverse study to date examining the epidemiology of bacteremia in infants. We suggest E. coli is the most common cause of bacteremia in previously healthy febrile infants admitted to a general inpatient unit. We identified no cases of L monocytogenes and question whether empirical therapy remains necessary for this pathogen.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis: an old problem with new insights.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis continues to be a common and significant health care burden, especially in very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBW<1500 g). Though intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of early-onset group B streptococcal infection dramatically, it still remains a major cause of neonatal sepsis. Moreover, some studies among VLBW preterm infants have shown an increase in early-onset sepsis caused by Escherichia coli. As the signs and symptoms of neonatal sepsis are nonspecific, early diagnosis and prompt treatment remains a challenge. There have been a myriad of studies on various diagnostic markers like hematological indices, acute phase reactants, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, cytokines, and cell surface markers among others. Nonetheless, further research is needed to identify a biomarker with high diagnostic accuracy and validity. Some of the newer markers like inter alpha inhibitor proteins have shown promising results thereby potentially aiding in early detection of neonates with sepsis. In order to decrease the widespread, prolonged use of unnecessary antibiotics and improve the outcome of the infants with sepsis, reliable identification of sepsis at an earlier stage is paramount.
TI  - Bacteria detected after instrumentation surgery for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis in a canine model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to identify the presence, type and origin of bacteria adjacent to the metal implant in the infected region in a canine model of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis treated with single-stage anterior autogenous bone grafting and instrumentation. METHODS: Dogs with pyogenic spondylodiscitis underwent one-stage debridement, autogenous bone grafting and titanium plate instrumentation and perioperative antibiotic therapy. The implants and adjacent vertebral bones were removed surgically at various postoperative time points (4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks) for bacteria detection. Bacteria were detected from retrieved spinal implants as well as surrounding bones by culture and/or pyrosequencing methods in 17 (85%) of all 20 animals. The positive rate for bacteria presence was 45% by culture and 80% by pyrosequencing method. RESULTS: Radiological or macroscopic examination showed no signs for infection recurrence in any animal regardless of bacteria presence at the surgical site. However, organism identical with the causative bacterium for spinal infection was found in only two of nine culture-positive animals. CONCLUSION: Within the confines of the study, the use of metallic implants in an infected area did not lead to a clinically relevant infection although bacteria may exist at the surgical site. The use of metallic implants in an infected area of the spine is safe. The metallic implants may not be the "culprit" for the persistence or recurrence of infection.
TI  - Antibiotic use during pregnancy alters the commensal vaginal microbiota.
AB  - Antibiotics may induce alterations in the commensal microbiota of the birth canal in pregnant women. Therefore, we studied the effect of antibiotic administration during pregnancy on commensal vaginal bacterial colonization at gestational week 36. Six hundred and sixty-eight pregnant women from the novel unselected Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010 ) pregnancy cohort participated in this analysis. Detailed information on oral antibiotic prescriptions during pregnancy filled at the pharmacy was obtained and verified prospectively. Vaginal samples were obtained at pregnancy week 36 and cultured for bacteria. Women who received oral antibiotics during any pregnancy trimester had an increased rate of colonization by Staphylococcus species in the vaginal samples as compared with samples obtained from women without any antibiotic treatment during pregnancy (adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.06-2.52, p 0.028). Oral antibiotic administration in the third trimester were also associated with increased colonization by Staphylococcus species (adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04-3.76, p 0.037). These bacteriological changes were associated with urinary tract infection antibiotics. Women treated in the third trimester of pregnancy were more often colonized by Escherichia coli than women without antibiotic treatment in the third trimester (adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04-3.52, p 0.038). This change was associated with respiratory tract infection (RTI) antibiotics. We did not observe any significant changes in vaginal Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptoccocus) or Staphylococcus aureus colonization following antibiotic treatment in pregnancy. Antibiotic administration during pregnancy leads to alterations in the vaginal microbiological ecology prior to birth, with potential morbidity, and long-term effects on the early microbial colonization of the neonate.
TI  - In vitro characterization of PlySK1249, a novel phage lysin, and assessment of its antibacterial activity in a mouse model of Streptococcus agalactiae bacteremia.
AB  - Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus agalactiae is the leading cause of bacteremia and invasive infections. These diseases are treated with beta-lactams or macrolides, but the emergence of less susceptible and even fully resistant strains is a cause for concern. New bacteriophage lysins could be promising alternatives against such organisms. They hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage cycle, in order to release the phage progeny. By using a bioinformatic approach to screen several beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gene coding for a lysin was identified on a prophage carried by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis SK1249. The gene product, named PlySK1249, harbored an original three-domain structure with a central cell wall-binding domain surrounded by an N-terminal amidase and a C-terminal CHAP domain. Purified PlySK1249 was highly lytic and bactericidal for S. dysgalactiae (2-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min). Moreover, it also efficiently killed S. agalactiae (1.5-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min) but not several streptococcal commensal species. We further investigated the activity of PlySK1249 in a mouse model of S. agalactiae bacteremia. Eighty percent of the animals (n = 10) challenged intraperitoneally with 10(6) CFU of S. agalactiae died within 72 h, whereas repeated injections of PlySK1249 (45 mg/kg 3 times within 24 h) significantly protected the mice (P < 0.01). Thus, PlySK1249, which was isolated from S. dysgalactiae, demonstrated high cross-lytic activity against S. agalactiae both in vitro and in vivo. These encouraging results indicated that PlySK1249 might represent a good candidate to be developed as a new enzybiotic for the treatment of systemic S. agalactiae infections.
TI  - New non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  - Hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. World health organization (WHO) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. In this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. The new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (PCA) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (CS) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MR S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant S. epidermidis (MDR S. epidermidis), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and three clinical isolates: MR S. aureus, MDR S. epidermidis, and an E. coli strain. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices were evaluated. Ethanol 70% V/V, isopropanol 60% V/V, and 4% w/V chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. Copper sulphate pentahydrate was very effective against all tested microorganisms: The MIC and MBC for CS ranged from 781 mg/l against S. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against E. coli strains and C. albicans. In addition, PCA exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. The combination of CS and PCA showed a strong synergistic effect and all FIC indices were </=0.500. The combination of CS and PCA were more effective than ethanol 70% V/V and isopropanol 60% V/V. In addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. This work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Improved protease stability of the antimicrobial peptide Pin2 substituted with D-amino acids.
AB  - Cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted a great interest as novel class of antibiotics that might help in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. However, some AMPs with high antimicrobial activities are also highly hemolytic and subject to proteolytic degradation from human and bacterial proteases that limit their pharmaceutical uses. In this work a D-diastereomer of Pandinin 2, D-Pin2, was constructed to observe if it maintained antimicrobial activity in the same range as the parental one, but with the purpose of reducing its hemolytic activity to human erythrocytes and improving its ability to resist proteolytic cleavage. Although, the hydrophobic and secondary structure characteristics of L- and D-Pin2 were to some extent similar, an important reduction in D-Pin2 hemolytic activity (30-40 %) was achieved compared to that of L-Pin2 over human erythrocytes. Furthermore, D-Pin2 had an antimicrobial activity with a MIC value of 12.5 muM towards Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in agar diffusion assays, but it was half less potent than that of L-Pin2. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of D-Pin2 was equally effective as that of L-Pin2 in microdilution assays. Yet, when D- and L-Pin2 were incubated with trypsin, elastase and whole human serum, only D-Pin2 kept its antimicrobial activity towards all bacteria, but in diluted human serum, L- and D-Pin2 maintained similar peptide stability. Finally, when L- and D-Pin2 were incubated with proteases from P. aeruginosa DFU3 culture, a clinical isolated strain, D-Pin2 kept its antibiotic activity while L-Pin2 was not effective.
TI  - Functional characterization of recombinant bromelain of Ananas comosus expressed  in a prokaryotic system.
AB  - Bromelain (BRM) is a defense protein present in the fruit and stem of pineapple (Ananas comosus) and it is grouped as a cysteine protease enzyme with diversified medicinal uses. Based on its therapeutic applications, bromelain has got sufficient attention in pharmaceutical industries. In the present study, the full coding gene of bromelain in pineapple stem (1,093 bp) was amplified by RT-PCR. The PCR product was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The sequence analysis of the gene revealed the single nucleotide polymorphism and its phylogenetic relatedness. The peptide sequence deduced from the gene showed the amino acid variations, physicochemical properties and secondary and tertiary structural features of the protein. The full BRM gene was transformed to prokaryotic vector pET32b and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3pLysS host cells successfully. The identity of the recombinant bromelain (rBRM) protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-BRM-rabbit IgG antibody. The activity of recombinant bromelain compared with purified native bromelain was determined by protease assay. The inhibitory effect of rBRM compared with native BRM in the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains of Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli O111 was evident from the antibacterial sensitivity test. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the bactericidal property of rBRM expressed in a prokaryotic system.
TI  - Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents among bovine mastitis pathogens isolated from North American dairy cattle, 2002-2010.
AB  - Approximately 8,000 isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, isolated by 25 veterinary laboratories across North America between 2002 and 2010, were tested for in vitro susceptibility to beta-lactam, macrolide, and lincosamide drugs. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the beta-lactam drugs remained low against most of the Gram-positive strains tested, and no substantial changes in the MIC distributions were seen over time. Of the beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested, only ceftiofur showed good in vitro activity against E. coli. The MICs of the macrolides and lincosamides also remained low against Gram-positive mastitis pathogens. While the MIC values given by 50% of isolates (MIC50) for erythromycin and pirlimycin and the streptococci were all low (</=0.5 microg/ml), the MIC values given by 90% of isolates (MIC90) were higher and more variable, but with no apparent increase over time. Staphylococcus aureus showed little change in erythromycin susceptibility over time, but there may be a small, numerical increase in pirlimycin MIC50 and MIC90 values. Overall, the results suggest that mastitis pathogens in the United States and Canada have not shown any substantial changes in the in vitro susceptibility to beta-lactam, macrolide, and lincosamide drugs tested over the 9 years of the study.
TI  - [The pharmacodynamic research on fuxiye, a Chinese herbal lotion for external wash].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe antisepsis, anti-swelling, and therapeutic effects of Fuxiye (FXY), a Chinese medical lotion for external wash in treating vaginitis model rats. METHODS: The cervicitis rat model was induced by agar plate diffusion, ear auricle swelling induced by dimethylbenzene, and chemical stimulus. The in vitro antibiotic actions of FXY were observed. Besides, its effects on the swelling and inflammation in model rats were also observed. RESULTS: FXY at 25 mg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, pyogenic Streptococcus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. FXY at 50 mg/mL could completely inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. It obviously restrained dimethylbenzene induced ear auricle swelling. It significantly alleviated cervicitis induced by chemical stiumli. CONCLUSION: FXY showed better effects on antisepsis, anti-inflammation, and treating cervicitis.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Anti-bacterial activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 secreted in the milk of transgenic goats produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer.
AB  - The present study was conducted to determine whether recombinant human beta-defensin-3 (rHBD3) in the milk of transgenic goats has an anti-bacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) that could cause mastitis. A HBD3 mammary-specific expression vector was transfected by electroporation into goat fetal fibroblasts which were used to produce fourteen healthy transgenic goats by somatic cell nuclear transfer. The expression level of rHBD3 in the milk of the six transgenic goats ranged from 98 to 121 microg/ml at 15 days of lactation, and was maintained at 90-111 microg/ml during the following 2 months. Milk samples from transgenic goats showed an obvious inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. aureus and S. agalactiae in vitro. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of rHBD3 in milk against E. coli, S. aureus and S. agalactiae were 9.5-10.5, 21.8-23.0 and 17.3-18.5 microg/mL, respectively, which was similar to those of the HBD3 standard (P>0.05). The in vivo anti-bacterial activities of rHBD3 in milk were examined by intramammary infusion of viable bacterial inoculums. We observed that 9/10 and 8/10 glands of non-transgenic goats infused with S. aureus and E. coli became infected. The mean numbers of viable bacteria went up to 2.9x10(3) and 95.4x10(3) CFU/ml at 48 h after infusion, respectively; the mean somatic cell counts (SCC) in infected glands reached up to 260.4x10(5) and 622.2x10(5) cells/ml, which were significantly higher than the SCC in uninfected goat glands. In contrast, no bacteria was presented in glands of transgenic goats and PBS-infused controls, and the SSC did not significantly change throughout the period. Moreover, the compositions and protein profiles of milk from transgenic and non-transgenic goats were identical. The present study demonstrated that HBD3 were an effective anti-bacterial protein to enhance the mastitis resistance of dairy animals.
TI  - Comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  - The objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the Milk Analysis Laboratory (L.I.G.A.L.) at Galicia, Spain from June 2005 to September 2011. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as Cluster Analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. The decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in IMI caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. The obtained results reflect a greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional classification into contagious or environmental. Staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. Among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, Strep. uberis showed a different behavior to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species and Streptococcus other than Strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. Time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as Cluster Analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. Furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.
TI  - Pathogen profile of clinical mastitis in Irish milk-recording herds reveals a complex aetiology.
AB  - Effective mastitis control requires knowledge of the predominant pathogen challenges on the farm. In order to quantify this challenge, the aetiological agents associated with clinical mastitis in 30 milk-recording dairy herds in Ireland over a complete lactation were investigated. Standard bacteriology was performed on 630 pretreatment quarter milk samples, of which 56 per cent were culture-positive, 42 per cent culture-negative and 2 per cent contaminated. Two micro-organisms were isolated from almost 5 per cent of the culture-positive samples. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (23 per cent), Streptococcus uberis (17 per cent), Escherichia coli (9 per cent), Streptococcus species (6 per cent), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (4 per cent) and other species (1 per cent). A wide variety of bacterial species were associated with clinical mastitis, with S aureus the most prevalent pathogen overall, followed by S uberis. However, the bacterial challenges varied widely from farm to farm. In comparison with previous reports, in the present study, the contagious pathogens S aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae were less commonly associated with clinical mastitis, whereas, the environmental pathogens S uberis and E coli were found more commonly associated with clinical mastitis. While S aureus remains the pathogen most commonly associated with intramammary infection in these herds, environmental pathogens, such as S uberis and E coli also present a considerable challenge.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid of children with suspected acute meningitis in a Nigerian tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the common aetiolog of acute bacterial meningitis in children and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study with a review of cerebrospinal fluid culture reports of paediatric patients aged 0-15 years, suspected of acute meningitis in the Medical Microbiology Department of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria from October 2006 to October 2009 from October 2006 to October 2009. RESULTS: A positive culture bacterial isolation rate of 3.3% (n=50/1500) with prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), Neisseria meningitidis (22%), Escherichia coli (16%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Group B streptococci (8%) and Enterococci (8%) which were susceptible to ceftriaxone (96%), cefotaxime (95%) and ciprofloxacin (93%) across the bacterial isolates. Neonates were 55% (n=6.8/12.4) most at risk. CONCLUSION: Neonates are the most at risk of acute bacterial meningitis. In the absence of antibiotic susceptibility report, ceftriaxone should be considered as a first choice reliable antibiotic for empirical treatment of meningitis in children, in this environment.
TI  - Peripartum bacteremia in the era of group B streptococcus prophylaxis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the microbial epidemiology and clinical risk factors associated with peripartum bacteremia in the era of group B streptococcus prophylaxis. METHODS: We identified all cases of maternal bacteremia occurring during the peripartum time period (defined as from 7 days before delivery until 30 days after delivery) in a large maternity center from 2000 to 2008. Chart review was performed to determine the clinical factors associated with bacteremia. RESULTS: During the study period, blood cultures were obtained from 1,295 febrile peripartum women (1.6% of all parturients); 172 of 1,295 febrile peripartum women (13.3%) had bacteremia (2.2 cases per 1,000 deliveries) with 194 microbial isolates and 1 yeast. The most frequent bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli (35.9%), enterococci (23.6%), and anaerobic species (9.2%); group B streptococcus was isolated in only eight cases (4.1%). Clinical diagnoses among infected women included endometritis (56%), chorioamnionitis (21%), and urosepsis (8%). Among women with endometritis, 77% underwent cesarean delivery (compared with vaginal delivery; relative risk [RR] 10.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.75-17.45) and 39% delivered at less than 37 weeks of gestation (compared with 37 weeks or more; RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.42-4.25). Severe maternal complications of bacteremia were noted; six women required intensive care unit admission, five women had development of ileus, and one death occurred because of urosepsis. CONCLUSION: In the era of group B streptococcus prophylaxis, E coli and enterococci are the most frequent bacteria isolated in peripartum bacteremia. Group B streptococcus accounted for only 4% of cases. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Adaptive response of Group B streptococcus to high glucose conditions: new insights on the CovRS regulation network.
AB  - Although the contribution of carbohydrate catabolism to bacterial colonization and infection is well recognized, the transcriptional changes during these processes are still unknown. In this study, we have performed comparative global gene expression analysis of GBS in sugar-free versus high glucose milieu. The analysis revealed a differential expression of genes involved in metabolism, transport and host-pathogen interaction. Many of them appeared to be among the genes previously reported to be controlled by the CovRS two-component system. Indeed, the transcription profile of a DeltacovRS strain grown in high-glucose conditions was profoundly affected. In particular, of the total genes described to be regulated by glucose, approximately 27% were under CovRS control with a functional role in protein synthesis, transport, energy metabolism and regulation. Among the CovRS dependent genes, we found bibA, a recently characterized adhesin involved in bacterial serum resistance and here reported to be down-regulated by glucose. ChIP analysis revealed that in the presence of glucose, CovR binds bibA promoter in vivo, suggesting that CovR may act as a negative regulator or a repressor. We also demonstrated that, as for other target promoters, chemical phosphorylation of CovR in aspartic acid increases its affinity for the bibA promoter region. The data reported in this study contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms modulating the adaptation of GBS to glucose.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending Saint Camille Medical Centre in Ouagadougou. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. Furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. RESULTS: The results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. Candida albicans (48.76%), followed by Escherichia coli (16.67%), Streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. However, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. Efforts should be made to address these points in the country.
TI  - Development of a chip-based multiplexed immunoassay using liposomal nanovesicles  and its application in the detection of pathogens causing female lower genital tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cervicovaginitis is a highly prevalent disease that is a burden on healthcare globally. Immediate and adequate treatment can eradicate the infection and block subsequent complications. The feasibility of achip-based multiplexed immunoassay using liposomal nanovesicles was tested. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multiplexed immunoassay chip containing five antibodies for five pathogens (Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans) was established and tested. Four patients with spiking of candidiasis were enrolled. The difference between positive and negative readings was evaluated using the paired Student t test. RESULTS: The detection threshold of Candida in this microarray was 100,000 CFU/mL in a vaginal sample, and the time required for the whole procedure was 3 hours. The testing of the four patients showed 100% for both sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: This microarray chip was a rapid, easy, inexpensive and sensitive tool for detecting female lower genital tract Candida infection in a one-time vaginal sampling process, although the data on the four other pathogens were still unavailable. A larger population study is encouraged to test the validity of this multiplexed immunoassay chip.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel pleuromutilin derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thioether moiety has been  synthesized via acylation reaction under mild conditions. Their in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. Among the 17 compounds screened, 14-O-[(4-methoxybenzamide-2- methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 4i, 14-O-[(2-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5a and 14-O-[(4-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5c were resulted as most active antibacterial agents.
TI  - Neonatal infectious diseases: evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis remains a feared cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period. Maternal, neonatal, and environmental factors are associated with risk of infection, and a combination of prevention strategies, judicious neonatal evaluation, and early initiation of therapy are required to prevent adverse outcomes. This article reviews recent trends in epidemiology and provides an update on risk factors, diagnostic methods, and management of neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Characterization of the sialic acid synthase from Aliivibrio salmonicida suggests a novel pathway for bacterial synthesis of 7-O-acetylated sialic acids.
AB  - Resolving the enzymatic pathways leading to sialic acids (Sias) in bacteria are vitally important for understanding their roles in pathogenesis and for subsequent development of tools to combat infections. A detailed characterization of the involved enzymes is also essential due to the highly applicable properties of Sias, i.e., as used in a wide range of medical applications and human nutrition. Bacterial strains that produce Sias display them mainly on their cell surface to mimic animal cells thereby evading the host's immune system. Despite several studies, little is known about the virulence mechanisms of the fish pathogen Aliivibrio salmonicida. The genome of A. salmonicida LFI1238 contains a gene cluster homologous to the Escherichia coli neuraminic acid (Neu) gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of Sias found in the E. coli capsule. This cluster is probably responsible for the biosynthesis of Neu found in A. salmonicida. In this work, we have produced and characterized the sialic acid (Sia) synthase NeuB1, the key enzyme in the pathway. The Sia synthase is an enzyme producing N-acetylneuraminic acid by the condensation of N-acetylmannosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate. Genome content, kinetic data obtained, together with structural considerations, have led us to the prediction that the substrate for NeuB1 from A. salmonicida, E. coli and Streptococcus agalactiae among others, is 4-O-acetyl-N-acetylmannosamine. This means that the product of its enzymatic reaction is 7-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid. We propose a pathway for production of this Sia in A. salmonicida, and present evidence for the presence of diacetylated Neu in the bacterium.
TI  - Comparative microbial analysis of paired amniotic fluid and cord blood from pregnancies complicated by preterm birth and early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: 16S rRNA-based genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases. Many cases which were recognized as "idiopathic" are now known to have an infectious etiology. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study to examine the microbial link between intra-amniotic infection (IAI) and early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS). RESULTS: Using culture independent methods, we analyzed paired amniotic fluid (AF) and cord blood (CB) samples from 36 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (PTB), IAI, and/or EONS. PTB cases were grouped as 1) Group 1- neonatal blood culture-positive EONS (n=6). 2) Group 2- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed EONS with positive IAI (n=16). 3) Group 3- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed EONS with no IAI (n=7); 4) Group 4- no EONS or IAI (n=7). In addition, samples from term healthy deliveries (n=8) served as technical controls. A total of 31 species (15 non-redundant) were identified in AF, of which only 1/3 were cultivated. Significantly fewer microorganisms were detected in CB, with a total of 18 species (7 non-redundant) identified, of which only 2 (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae) were cultivated. Of those, Bergeyella, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Sneathia sanguinegens had not been detected in EONS before. The novel species identified in AF by PCR include Peptoniphilus harei and Lachnospiraceae sp. The majority (72%) of CB species were also detected in the matching AF, with E. coli and F. nucleatum as the most prevalent. The 16S rRNA sequences of paired AF and CB were 99.9-100% identical, while no identical sequences were found between different pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Previously unrecognized, uncultivated or difficult-to-cultivate species are implicated in EONS. Microbial species in paired AF and CB likely share the same infectious origin. Given its prevalence in EONS, F. nucleatum should be placed on the same importance scale as E. coli.
TI  - Donor-derived bacteremia in liver transplant recipients despite antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  - As the disparity between the number of candidates listed for transplant and the number of donors continues to grow, marginal organ donors are increasingly utilized. This includes bacteremic donors which may carry an increased risk of transmission of infection. It is recommended that recipients of organs from bacteremic donors receive antibiotic prophylaxis based on the susceptibilities of the donor isolate to prevent transmission. Here, we present four cases of donor-derived bacteremia, despite appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis, in four liver transplant recipients. Transmitted pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus in two cases, and Escherichia coli and Group B Streptococcus each in one case. Interestingly, none of the nonhepatic organs (n=10) utilized from these bacteremic donors resulted in transmissions. These cases highlight the fact that risk of transmission from bacteremic donors is not eliminated with antimicrobial therapy in the donor and recipient. As no transmissions occurred in recipients of nonhepatic organs from these donors, these cases also suggest that liver recipients may be at higher risk of donor transmitted bacteremia.
TI  - Severe infections in twins.
AB  - We describe 4 sets of twins 5 days to 10 weeks of age with a serious bacterial or viral infection. The issue of the occurrence of a simultaneous infection in twins and the clinical dilemma of the appropriate evaluation and treatment of an asymptomatic co-twin of infants with a serious infection is discussed.
TI  - Comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees C and -20 degrees C on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen (N) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. Bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen. An effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the South African National Milk Recording Scheme (NMRS) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/mL milk. The organisation responsible for sample collection of the NMRS milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. This existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.Ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. An additional sampling was performed at week 30 for samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees C. Freezing and cryopreservation did not impair subsequent isolation of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus (STH) (phage type lytic group III) or Sta. aureus (STA) (phage typed, other than lytic group III). Survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. The survival of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and Escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. Coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.Both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in South African dairy herds.
TI  - Recent developments and current issues in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of bacterial and fungal neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Identifying neonates with sepsis is complicated by variability in clinical presentation. The incidence of early onset sepsis (EOS) resulting from invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) infections has been notably reduced by the widespread delivery of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Rates of EOS attributable to non-GBS etiologies have remained constant, and ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli has become more prevalent. Late-onset sepsis (LOS) attributable to gram-positive organisms including coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among premature infants. Invasive candidiasis is an emerging cause of LOS, especially among infants who receive broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Prophylactic fluconazole administration to very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates during the first 6 weeks of life prevents invasive candidiasis in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) with high rates of fungal infections. Targeted fluconazole prophylaxis may be beneficial in VLBW neonates who receive care in NICUs with lower rates of invasive fungal infections. Assessment of immune function, neutrophil markers, acute phase reactants, and utilization of sepsis screening scores may contribute to the management of sepsis. Maternal decolonization, antimicrobial stewardship, early enteral feeding, and optimal infection control practices are potential practical strategies for reducing the burden of neonatal sepsis.
TI  - No change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the neonatal ICU over two decades.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify trends in early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis neonatal rates and to evaluate the appropriateness of the empirical antibiotic protocols. DESIGN: A 17-yr (1993-2009) analysis of positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. SETTING: The two neonatal ICUs at the Hadassah- Hebrew University Medical Center. RESULTS: During this period, 991 infants had at least one episode of either bacteremia or meningitis. The overall incidence of early-onset sepsis was 0.64 per 1,000 live births with a nonsignificant trend over the study period (p = 0.37). The overall incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the incidence rates (p = 0.021). The incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the prevalence rates (p = 0.021). The prevalence of early-onset group B Streptococcus bacteremia decreased significantly throughout the study period. Among late-onset sepsis, Gram-positive and fungi infection rates were stable over time, while Gram-negative infection rates showed a significant positive trend (p = 0.007). No significant change in the susceptibility rate of the isolated Gram-negative bacteria in late-onset sepsis for the common antibacterial drugs was found. About 85% and 90% of the isolated organisms were susceptible to our early-onset sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin) and late-onset sepsis (vancomycin and cefotaxime) protocols, respectively, and these rates were stable over the study period (p = .1 and .55, respectively). Sepsis-related mortality was higher among Gram- negative sepsis cases resistant to our empiric antibiotic protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Our empiric antibiotic protocols are appropriate despite their continuous use over the last 17 yrs. This may have been achieved by the use of a controlled antibiotic program and infection control efforts.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of black thyme (Thymbra spicata L.) essential oils.
AB  - In order to study antimicrobial effects of essential oils of Wild Thyme (Thymbra  spicata L.) on two Gram positive bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae RJTTC1978 and Staphylococcus aureus RJTTC1885) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli RJTTC2409 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RJTTC1097), the research carried out with five concentrations (0.2, 2, 4, 10 and 20 microl) using disk diffusion and microbroth dilution (to determine MIC and MBC) methods at Ilam University during 2010. Tetracycline and Gentamicin discs were used as control. Chemical composition of the EOs was analyzed by GC-MS. Antioxidant activity of the essential oils (EOs) was measured following DPPH assay. Results showed that Carvacrol (60.36%), gamma-Terpinene (15.09%), beta-Myrcene (2.15%), trans-Caryophyllene (1.78%) and alpha-Thujene (1.54%) were the main components of the oils. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity revealed that the oils were active against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. However, the biggest growth inhibitory zone (33.34 +/- 0.5 mm) was recorded on Streptococcus agalactiae at 20 microl/ml concentration. The lowest MIC (3.12 microl/ml) observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, while minimum MBC (6.25 microl/ml) recorded on Klebsiella pneumoniae. Radical-scavenging ability of the EOs and BHT ranged from 9.93 +/- 2.57 to 77.81 +/- 1.3% and 80.48 +/- 0.56 to 10.66 +/- 1.11%, respectively. The inhibiting effect of Thymbra oils was stronger than the synthetic BHT, particularly at lower concentrations, as IC50 concentration of EOs for the reduction of DPPH radicals was 1.28 microl/ml which was lower than IC50 calculated for BHT (1.31 microl/ml). The total phenolic content, determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, was 1.52 +/- 0.15 mg PyE/ml EOs.
TI  - [Childhood bacterial meningitis trends in Japan from 2009 to 2010].
AB  - We conducted a pediatric survey of bacterial meningitis epidemiology from January 2009 to December 2010 in Japan, and obtained the following results for 314 cases (186 boys, 124 girls, and 4 with gender not reported). Children younger than one year old accounted for the majority of cases (51.2%, 161/314), and the incidence decreased with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae (in children aged 1 month to 5 years old) was the most common cause of infection (53.2%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 month to 12 years, 24.2%), Streptococcus agalactiae (0-4 months, 7.6%), and Escherichia coli (0-3 months, 3.2%). Susceptibility tests showed that 50.1% (78/153) of the H. influenzae isolates and 63.0% (46/73) of the S. pneumoniae isolates were drug-resistant. Combinations of ampicillin and cephem or carbapenem and other beta-lactams were mainly used as the initial antibiotics for patients under 4 months of age (77.8%, 42/54), and a carbapenem and other beta-lactam combination was used for patients aged 4 months and older (76.4%, 198/259). The final antibiotics for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were mainly cefotaxime (CTX) or ceftriaxone (CTRX) and carbapenem, respectively. The overall fatality rate was 2.0% (6/305). Since the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib vaccine) and the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) are not widely used in Japan, only 5 patients in our cohort (all with meningitis not caused by H. influenzae) had been immunized with the Hib vaccine, and none had been immunized with the PCV7 vaccine. No remarkable changes in the characteristics of pediatric meningitis have been observed for several years in Japan.
TI  - [Clinical manifestations and treatment of early-onset neonatal sepsis: a Chinese-French comparison].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To realize the difference between China and France in the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and to provide basis to improve the level of our hospital in diagnosing and treating this disease. METHOD: Data of 146 cases of EONS were retrospectively analyzed. All data were collected from our hospital and a French hospital. Bacterial spectrum, clinical manifestations, use of antibacterial drugs, occurrence of recording and screening of perinatal risk factors were compared between the two hospitals. RESULT: The most common pathogenic bacteria in our hospital were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (69.2%) and Escherichia coli (15.4%) while in the French Hospital, group B streptococcus (33.3%) and Escherichia coli (33.3%). The most common pathogenic bacteria in gastric liquid and peripheral swabs of the French hospital were Escherichia coli (33.3%) and group B streptococcus (21.2%). Total days of antibacterial use 11.4 +/- 7.2 (d), mean sorts of antibacterial drugs for single patient (3.1 +/- 0.9) and proportion of patients who had antibacterial drug changes (70.2%) were greater than the French hospital 6.2 +/- 2.5 (d), 2.2 +/- 0.8(d), (9.9%). Both hospitals were inclined to combine 2 antibacterial drugs for the first dose (second-generation cephalosporins + semi-synthetic penicillin in our hospital vs. amoxicillin + amikacin in the French hospital). The common second and third line antibacterial drugs in our hospital are carbapenems and vancomycin vs. third-generation cephalosporins and vancomycin in the French hospital. The rates of occurrence of recording and screening perinatal risk factors (chorioamnionitis, maternal fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, screening results of vaginal swabs or urinary infection, amniotic fluid contamination, prenatal antibacterial prophylaxis, anamnesis of EONS) in our hospital was all lower than those of the French hospital. There was no significant difference in positive rate of perinatal risk factors between the two hospitals. For newborns hospitalized for immediate abnormalities after birth, the most common symptom was respiratory distress (96.5% vs. 88.2%). For those admitted after a period of time after birth, the proportion of abnormalities was different: in our hospital, the most common reasons were respiratory distress (44.4%) and lethargy (22.2%) while in the French hospital there were rise of C reactive proteins (78.2%) and fever (5.5%). The false negative rate of C reactive proteins in diagnosing EONS was not significantly different between the two hospitals. CONCLUSION: There was significant difference in diagnosing and treating EONS in the two hospitals. Emphasis on screening and recording perinatal risk factors, as well as strengthened surveillance on neonates in obstetric department could improve the accuracy of early diagnosis of EONS of our hospital. Positive attitude to gastric liquid and peripheral swabs culture, with drug susceptibility test may help pediatricians better select antibacterial drugs and reduce unnecessary changes and the total time of antibiotic use.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Effectiveness of treatment with surfactant in premature infants with respiratory  failure and pulmonary infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surfactant inactivation is present in neonatal pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine preterm babies with Birth Weight (BW) < or = 1250 grams were studied and subdivided in two groups: RDS Group, with a diagnosis of "simple" RDS (N 80) and RDS with Pneumonia Group, consisting of babies with a diagnosis of RDS and a positive BALF culture in the first 24-48 h of life (N 59). OUTCOMES: Surfactant administration seems less effective in the latter group, because a significantly higher number of infants needed a second dose of surfactant, compared to the patients suffering from RDS alone. (www.actabiomedica.it).
TI  - Group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli infections in the intensive care nursery in the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli cause serious bacterial infections (SBIs) and are associated with morbidity and mortality in newborn infants. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis reduces early-onset SBIs caused by GBS. The effect of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on late-onset SBIs caused by these organisms is unknown. METHODS: We examined all blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid culture results from infants admitted from 1997 to 2010 to 322 neonatal intensive care units managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group. We identified infants with positive cultures for GBS or E. coli and compared the incidence of early- and late-onset SBI for each organism in the time period before (1997 to 2001) and after (2002 to 2010) universal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations. RESULTS: We identified 716,407 infants with cultures, 2520 (0.4%) with cultures positive for GBS and 2476 (0.3%) with cultures positive for E. coli. The incidence of GBS early-onset SBI decreased between 1997 to 2001 and 2002 to 2010 from 3.5 to 2.6 per 1000 admissions, and the incidence for E. coli early-onset SBI remained stable (1.4/1000 admissions in both time periods). Over the same time period, the incidence of GBS late-onset SBI increased from 0.8 to 1.1 per 1000 admissions, and incidence of E. coli late-onset SBI increased from 2.2 to 2.5 per 1000 admissions. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the incidence of GBS early-onset SBI decreased, whereas the incidence of late-onset SBI for E. coli and GBS increased.
TI  - Immune modulation by group B Streptococcus influences host susceptibility to urinary tract infection by uropathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is most often caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC inoculation into the female urinary tract (UT) can occur through physical activities that expose the UT to an inherently polymicrobial periurethral, vaginal, or gastrointestinal flora. We report that a common urogenital inhabitant and opportunistic pathogen, group B Streptococcus (GBS), when present at the time of UPEC exposure, undergoes rapid UPEC-dependent exclusion from the murine urinary tract, yet it influences acute UPEC-host interactions and alters host susceptibility to persistent outcomes of bladder and kidney infection. GBS presence results in increased UPEC titers in the bladder lumen during acute infection and reduced inflammatory responses of murine macrophages to live UPEC or purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phenotypes that require GBS mimicry of host sialic acid residues. Taken together, these studies suggest that despite low titers, the presence of GBS at the time of polymicrobial UT exposure may be an overlooked risk factor for chronic pyelonephritis and recurrent UTI in susceptible groups, even if it is outcompeted and thus absent by the time of diagnosis.
TI  - Bayesian estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of a multiplex real-time PCR assay and bacteriological culture for 4 common bovine intramammary pathogens.
AB  - Bacteriological culture (BC) is the traditional method for intramammary infection diagnosis but lacks sensitivity and is time consuming. Multiplex real-time PCR (mr-PCR) enables testing the presence of several bacteria and reduces diagnosis time. Our objective was to estimate bacterial species-specific sensitivity (Se) and specificity of both BC and mr-PCR tests for detecting bacteria in milk samples from clinical mastitis cases and from apparently normal quarters, using a Bayesian latent class model. Milk samples from 1,014 clinical mastitis cases and 1,495 samples from apparently normal quarters were analyzed by BC and mr-PCR. Two positive culture definitions were used: >/=1 cfu/0.01 mL and >/=10 cfu/0.01 mL of the specified bacteria. The mr-PCR was designed to simultaneously detect Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The priors used in our Bayesian model were weakly informative, with BC priors using the best available error data. Results were compared with those obtained using uniform priors for mr-PCR to test robustness. Weak and uniform priors gave about the same posterior distributions except for Strep. uberis from normal quarters and Strep. agalactiae. Multiplex real-time PCR Se on milk from clinical mastitis were lower than mr-PCR Se on milk from normal quarters. Multiplex real-time PCR Se was higher than BC on milk from normal quarters. Multiplex real-time PCR Se was generally lower than BC on milk from clinical mastitis and it varied by clinical severity. The estimate specificities of detection for all pathogens were >/=99%, regardless of sample type. The effect of milk sample preservation before testing was evaluated and may have been a factor that affected our observed results. A significant association was observed between sample age and mr-PCR results leading to reduced detection of E. coli and Strep. agalactiae in nonclinical samples. Differences in sample age between conduct of BC and of mr-PCR did not concur with any apparent differences between Se estimates of the 2 tests. Further work should be done to extend these results to other PCR-based tests for detecting bacterial species in milk samples, for which presented results could be used as prior parameter distributions. Limits of sample handling and storage and the potential existence of substances in clinical case samples that may interfere with PCR reactions also are worth further investigation.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Quality of bulk tank milk samples from Danish dairy herds based on real-time polymerase chain reaction identification of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Results of a commercial real-time PCR analysis for 11 mastitis pathogens from bulk tank milk (BTM) samples from all 4,258 Danish dairy herds in November 2009 to January 2010 were compared with somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacteria count (TBC) estimates in BTM. For Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis, a low real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value (corresponding to high bacterial DNA quantity) was correlated with higher SCC and higher TBC. For Staphylococcus aureus, low Ct values were correlated only with higher SCC. For the environmental mastitis pathogens Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli, low Ct values had a correlation with higher TBC. Staphylococcus spp. were found in the BTM from all herds, Strep. uberis in 95%, Staph. aureus in 91%, and Strep. dysgalactiae in 86%, whereas E. coli, Klebsiella, and Strep. agalactiae were found in 61, 13, and 7% of the herds. It is concluded that the real-time PCR used provides results that are related to the milk quality in the herds. Real-time PCR can be used in the same way as culture for monitoring BTM samples, and is especially useful for bacteria with low prevalence (e.g., Strep. agalactiae).
TI  - Investigation of vaginal microbiota in sexually active women using hormonal contraceptives in Pakistan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies report association of contraceptives with moderate increase in urinary tract infection among sexually active premenopausal women. The aim of our study was to find out whether the use of hormonal contraceptives has any effect on microbiota of the vagina in the contraceptives users in Khairpur Sindh Pakistan. METHODS: A prospective study in woman population of Khairpur Sindh Pakistan aged 20-30 years and 31-40 years, using Hormonal contraceptives was carried out. High vaginal swab samples (n = 100) were collected from the test populations as well as control group (n = 100) and investigated for vaginal microbial flora using standard microbiological and biochemical techniques. RESULTS: Vaginal swabs culturing from hormonal contraceptives users in the age group 20-30 years showed statistically insignificant Candida sp (10% samples), and statistically significant (p < 0.05) Staphylococcus saprophyticus. (18% samples), Streptococcus agalactiae (23% samples), Escherichia coli (28% samples) and Lactobacillus fermentum (32% samples). In the age group 31-40 years, statistically significant percentage of samples (p < 0.05) showed Lactobacillus fermentum (28%), Candida sp (24%), and E. coli, (24%) where statistically insignificant samples showed Staphylococcus saprophyticus (13%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (11%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of hormonal contraceptives alters the normal microbiota of vagina in women according to the age. Lactobacillus fermentum appeared as the predominant species followed by E. coli among the age group of 20-30 years and, Lactobacillus fermentum, Candida sp and E. coli as predominant among women of age group 31-40 years when compared to corresponding control groups. An inverse relationship between E. coli and Lactobacillus fermentum was observed in the women aged 20-30 years.
TI  - Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  - Vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.
TI  - Maternal HIV infection and vertical transmission of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-exposed newborns may be at higher risk of sepsis because of immune system aberrations, impaired maternal antibody transfer and altered exposure to pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a study (clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00136370) conducted between April 2004 and October 2007 in South Africa. We used propensity score matching to evaluate the association between maternal HIV infection and (1) vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens; (2) vertical transmission of pathogens to the newborn; and (3) sepsis within 3 days of birth (EOS) or between 4-28 days of life (LOS). RESULTS: Colonization with group B Streptococcus (17% vs 23%, P = .0002), Escherichia coli (47% vs 45%, P = .374), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7% vs 10%, P = .008) differed modestly between HIV-infected and uninfected women, as did vertical transmission rates. Maternal HIV infection was not associated with increased risk of neonatal EOS or LOS, although culture-confirmed EOS was >3 times higher among HIV-exposed infants (P = .05). When compared with HIV-unexposed, neonates, HIV-exposed, uninfected neonates (HEU) had a lower risk of EOS (20.6 vs 33.7 per 1000 births; P = .046) and similar rate of LOS (5.8 vs 4.1; P = .563). HIV-infected newborns had a higher risk than HEU of EOS (134 vs 21.5; P < .0001) and LOS (26.8 vs 5.6; P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HIV infection was not associated with increased risk of maternal bacterial colonization, vertical transmission, EOS, or LOS. HIV-infected neonates, however, were at increased risk of EOS and LOS.
TI  - Genome-wide mapping of cystitis due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli in mice identifies a unique bladder transcriptome that signifies pathogen-specific antimicrobial defense against urinary tract infection.
AB  - The most common causes of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are Gram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli; however, Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus (GBS), also cause UTI. In GBS infection, UTI progresses to cystitis once the bacteria colonize the bladder, but the host responses triggered in the bladder immediately following infection are largely unknown. Here, we used genome-wide expression profiling to map the bladder transcriptome of GBS UTI in mice infected transurethrally with uropathogenic GBS that was cultured from a 35-year-old women with cystitis. RNA from bladders was applied to Affymetrix Gene-1.0ST microarrays; quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze selected gene responses identified in array data sets. A surprisingly small significant-gene list of 172 genes was identified at 24 h; this compared to 2,507 genes identified in a side-by-side comparison with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). No genes exhibited significantly altered expression at 2 h in GBS-infected mice according to arrays despite high bladder bacterial loads at this early time point. The absence of a marked early host response to GBS juxtaposed with broad-based bladder responses activated by UPEC at 2 h. Bioinformatics analyses, including integrative system-level network mapping, revealed multiple activated biological pathways in the GBS bladder transcriptome that regulate leukocyte activation, inflammation, apoptosis, and cytokine-chemokine biosynthesis. These findings define a novel, minimalistic type of bladder host response triggered by GBS UTI, which comprises collective antimicrobial pathways that differ dramatically from those activated by UPEC. Overall, this study emphasizes the unique nature of bladder immune activation mechanisms triggered by distinct uropathogens.
TI  - The impact of group B streptococcus prophylaxis on late-onset neonatal infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in late-onset neonatal infections and risk factors for ampicillin/penicillin-resistant microorganisms. STUDY DESIGN: Data on 584 infants with positive blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid cultures for bacteria or fungi at 8-30 days of age from 1990 to 2007 were examined and divided into three epochs, based on intrapartum antibiotic prophylactic (IAP) practices. Pathogens and antibiotic resistance were compared among epochs. RESULT: The number of candidal infections increased over time for the entire population (P=0.006). There was an increased incidence of Gram-negative (P=0.009) and candidal infections (P=0.014) among very low-birthweight infants. Only Escherichia coli infections showed increasing ampicillin resistance over epochs (P=0.006). In regression analysis, ampicillin/penicillin resistance increased with IAP use (odds ratio 2.05). CONCLUSION: Changing microorganisms and increasing antibiotic resistance in late-onset neonatal infections are likely multifactorial but are increased with IAP use, which may identify an at-risk population. Increasing Candida infections require further investigation.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - Sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  - We investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. Using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it is now a clinical problem in Japan. Six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). Major causative bacteria detected were Escherichia coli (65.0 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), Streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). From 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were E. coli (61.5 %), E. faecalis (13.7 %), K. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and S. agalactiae (4.0 %). The sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and cephems of E. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. In regard to infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [LVFX] >/=4 mug/mL), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of FQ administration within 1 month. Although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. The major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli were a history of FQ administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. It was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of FQ administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.
TI  - Factors for poor prognosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a medical center in Northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis has long been a severe infectious disease in neonates, as well as a leading cause of adverse outcomes. We designed this study to know the factors for poor prognosis in neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: We enrolled children aged less than 1 month who were admitted to Mackay Memorial Hospital from 1984 to 2008 and had culture-proven bacterial meningitis. The laboratory data and children's clinical features were recorded. The patients' outcomes were divided into four groups: death, having sequelae, complete recovery, and loss to follow-up. Patients with the outcomes of death and having sequelae were regarded as having a poor prognosis. Those who were lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis of outcome. Multivariate analyses were performed to find the risk factors for poor prognosis. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six neonates fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among these, 96 were boys (61.5%) and 102 (65.4%) had concomitant bacteremia. Group B streptococci (39.1%) and Escherichia coli (20.1%) were the two leading pathogens. Excluding those who were lost to follow-up (4.5%), 22 of 149 patients (14.8%) died, 36 (24.2%) had sequelae, and 91 (61.1%) recovered completely. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein more than 500 mg/dL at admission {odds ratio (OR): 171.18 [95% confidence interval (CI): 25.6-1000]}, predisposition to congenital heart disease [OR: 48.96 (95% CI: 6.06-395.64)], hearing impairment found during hospitalization [OR: 23.40 (95% CI: 3.62-151.25)], and seizure at admission or during hospitalization [OR: 10.10 (95% CI: 2.11-48.32)] were the factors predicting poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: In this 25-year study of newborns with bacterial meningitis, approximately one-seventh of the patients died, while two-fifths had sequelae. Nearly two-thirds of these had concomitant bacteremia. Group B streptococci and E. coli remained the two leading pathogens throughout the study period. Several factors for poor prognosis in newborns with culture-proven bacterial meningitis were found: high CSF protein concentration, congenital heart disease, hearing impairment, and seizure.
TI  - Relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. The balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the Lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe for humans. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of Lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on Lactobacilli isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to Babylon Hospital of Maternity and Paediatrics in Babylon province, Iraq. The study involved the role of intrauterine device among married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. This study also involved studying probiotic role of Lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. RESULTS: Results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. Intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. The most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All Lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (S. aureus, E. coli). Lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. Results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between Lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. This may be attributed to the production of defense factors by Lactobacilli. CONCLUSION: The types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (Lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.
TI  - The effect of multiplex-PCR-assessed major pathogens causing subclinical mastitis on somatic cell profiles.
AB  - The major pathogens causing mastitis were evaluated by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) with self-designed primers in four quarters of the first, third, and fifth parities in industrial, semi-industrial, and traditional dairy cattle farms in Iran. With the incidence of infection in the quarters by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae, the mean log somatic cell count (log SCC) increased from 5.06 to 5.77. The smallest changes occurred with Escherichia coli. Contagious pathogens, when compared with environmental pathogens, were more prevalent and common and created more profound quantitative and qualitative changes in SCC profiles. The second part of the study surveyed the diversity of contaminating pathogens and their effect on quantitative and qualitative profiles of somatic cells. M-PCR was used to determine the absence (M-PCR(-)) and presence of one (M-PCR(+1)), two (M-PCR(+2)), and three (M-PCR(+3)) major pathogens in raw milk samples. Quarter log SCC increased from 5.06 (for M-PCR(-1)) to 5.5 (for M-PCR(+1)), 5.7 (for M-PCR(+2)), and 6 (for M-PCR(+3)). Percent changes in polymorphonuclears (PMNs) were not significant between different quarters and parities but were significant between different farms in terms of pathogen diversity (P < 0.05). Therefore, by increasing the number of types of major pathogens involved in subclinical mastitis, SCC of udder quarters and the proportion of PMNs significantly increased, whereas the proportion of lymphocytes significantly decreased. This subject is very important in increasing the shelf life of dairy products, because PMNs are introduced to the enzymatic pools.
TI  - [Analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy Chinese women by using DNA-fingerprinting].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to Chinese females. METHODS: Women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in Peking University First Hospital from October 2009 to January 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. Vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the V3 region of 16S rDNA gene. PCR products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Featured bands on DGGE were recovered, cloned and sequenced. Alignment with known sequence was made by using Blast on GenBank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in different physiological states. RESULTS: (1) Vaginal flora in healthy Chinese women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, Lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. While L. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) Vaginal bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Veillonella sp., Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella sp., Anaerococcus lactolyticus and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSION: Based on the DGGE analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in Chinese healthy women at reproductive age are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,Bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing Veillonella sp. and Anaerococcus lactolyticus. Meanwhile Lactobacillus iners was firstly found by DGGE to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
TI  - Characteristics of early-onset neonatal sepsis caused by Escherichia coli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to document the perinatal risk factors associated with early-onset neonatal Escherichia coli sepsis and adverse neonatal outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study of early-onset E coli sepsis compared with that of non-E coli sepsis was conducted by a retrospective data review of all infants with a diagnosis of sepsis during the first 7 days of life from the pediatric unit of Mackay Memorial Hospital from January 2004 to October 2008. After adjustment for gestational age, each patient with E coli early-onset sepsis was further compared with two gestational age-matched uninfected controls. RESULTS: Compared with infants with non-E coli sepsis (n = 27), infants with E coli sepsis (n = 19) were more likely to have preterm birth, especially at less than 30 weeks of gestation (47% vs. 4%, p < 0.01), very low birth weights (<1500 g; 47% vs. 4%, p < 0.01), intrapartum fever (26% vs. 4%, p = 0.036), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM; 74% vs. 11%, p < 0.01), prolonged rupture of membranes (>24 hours; 47% vs. 0%, p < 0.01), antibiotic use (63% vs. 15%, p < 0.01), and sepsis onset on the first day of life (63% vs. 15%, p < 0.01). After adjusting for gestational age, intrapartum fever (26% vs. 5%, p = 0.035) and PPROM (74% vs. 39%, p = 0.015) were more common in infants with E coli sepsis. Fifteen of the 19 E coli isolates (79%) were ampicillin-resistant, and three (16%) were gentamicin-resistant. Antepartum and intrapartum antibiotic exposure was associated with ampicillin-resistant E coli sepsis (100% vs. 43%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Early-onset E coli sepsis is more common in premature and very low birth weight infants and is more likely associated with intrapartum fever, PPROM, and sepsis onset on the first day of life than non-E coli sepsis. Broad-spectrum, multiple antibiotics or longer duration of antibiotic exposure may be associated with antibiotic-resistant pathogen infection.
TI  - Acute toxicity evaluation, antibacterial, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects of Melastoma malabathricum.
AB  - Melastoma malabathricum (MM) is a well-known plant in Malaysian traditional medicine, locally known as senduduk. Its ethanol and aqueous extracts have been used in the present investigation to study the immunomodulatory role on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), and the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP free radical scavenging activities were also measured. Total flavonoids and total phenolic contents were assayed and the antibacterial effect was tested against four species of bacteria; two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae) and two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsilla pneumonia). The tests were carried out using the disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. Moreover, the acute toxicity was evaluated in vivo on the ethanol extract of MM to establish its safety when administered orally. In our results, both extracts of MM showed abilities to scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals, IC(50) values: (11.599 +/- 0.84, 10.573 +/- 0.58 micromol/L) and (62.657 +/- 0.78, 63.939 +/- 0.48 micromol/L) for ethanol and aqueous extracts respectively. Indeed the ethanol extract evidenced high phenolic content (384.33 +/- 0.005 mg/g), flavonoids contents (85.8 +/- 0.009 mg/g) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (33,590 +/- 0.038 mmol/g), with high activity against S. aureus and S. agalactiae (11 +/- 0.3 and 12 +/- 0.6 mm inhibition zones). Likewise, the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) viability was increased in response to MM, IC(50) values (1.781 +/- 1.2 and 6.545 +/- 0.93 microg/mL) for ethanol and aqueous extracts, respectively. In addition, our results showed that the MM extract is safe even at a high dose of 5,000 mg/kg and has no oral toxicity. These findings suggest the excellent medicinal bioactivity of MM and explain the popularity of this plant in the folk medicine as a remedy for different illnesses.
TI  - Escherichia coli Isolated from Urinary Tract Infections of Lebanese Patients between 2000 and 2009: Epidemiology and Profiles of Resistance.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the bacterial etiology of urinary tract infections in one of the busiest hospitals of Lebanon and to examine the epidemiologic and microbiologic properties of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections of Lebanese patients over a 10-year period. Methods. This retrospective study analyzed the data generated between 2000 and 2009 (10,013 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). Bacterial identification was based on standard culture and biochemical characteristics of isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method, and ESBL production was detected by synergy with third-generation cephalosporins and amoxiclav. Results. E. coli was the most frequent isolate throughout the ten years (60.64% of the total isolates). It was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae. E. coli occurred more frequently in women (69.8%) than in men (61.4%). The lowest percentage of susceptibility of E. coli was manifested against piperacillin and ampicillin. An increase in the production of ESBL was observed (2.3% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2009). Conclusions. The etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility profiles are important to be evaluated in countries like Lebanon where a severe misuse of antibiotics at all levels is observed.
TI  - An experimental mixed bacterial infection induced differential secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNFalpha) and proMMP-9 in human fetal membranes.
AB  - Overall, 1-4% of all births in the US are complicated by choriamnionitis. Choriamnionitis is a polymicrobial infection most often due to ascending genital microbes which, in over 65% of positive amniotic fluid cultures, involves two or more organisms. In this study, we determine the cytokines expression (IL-1beta, TNFalpha) and prometalloproteinase activation (proMMP-2 and proMMP-9) after double o single infection an in vitro model of human fetal membranes. Fetal membranes at term were mounted in the Transwell culture system and after 24 h of infection, choriodecidual, and amnion media was collected. IL-1beta and TNFalpha were evaluated by ELISA, whereas proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were determined by substrate gel zymography. The choriodecidual and amnion compartments actively respond to the infectious process, which induced the secretion of IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and proMMP-9 after either mixed or single infection. The proMMP-2 secretion profile was the same after all experimental conditions. There was no synergy between Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli for inducing the secretion of inflammatory factors or degradative metalloproteinase. In conclusion, these two bacteria could initiate different pathways to induce chorioamnioitis.
TI  - Group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli colonization in pregnant women and neonates in Lithuania.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of maternal and neonatal colonization with  group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli, and examine GBS serotypes and susceptibility to antibiotics. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in Lithuania between October 2006 and June 2007. Lower vaginal/rectal swabs were obtained from pregnant women (n=998) and ear canal/throat swabs were obtained from their newborns (n=827) for culture. RESULTS: Overall, maternal and neonatal GBS colonization rates were 15.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Serotypes III (34.5%) and Ia (29.7%) were most common. All GBS isolates were susceptible to penicillin and 4.1% were resistant to erythromycin. Overall, maternal and neonatal E. coli colonization rates were 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. In total, 71.4% of newborns with E. coli colonization were born to E. coli-negative mothers. E. coli was resistant to ampicillin and piperacillin in 25.9% and 16.6% of cases, respectively. The majority of E. coli-colonized newborns were contaminated with maternal fecal, but not vaginal, E. coli strains. CONCLUSION: Maternal and neonatal GBS colonization rates, serotypes, and susceptibility to antibiotics were comparable to those reported in previous studies. Population-based data regarding early-onset neonatal infection rates will enable the formulation of a prevention program for early-onset GBS disease in Lithuania.
TI  - Major causes of mastitis and associated risk factors in smallholder dairy farms in and around Hawassa, Southern Ethiopia.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was carried out from October 2008 to May 2009 in smallholder dairy farms in and around Hawassa to estimate the prevalence of mastitis, to isolate and characterize major bacterial pathogens, and to identify possible associated factors. The study involved a total of 201 milking cows randomly drawn from smallholder farms. The prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis was determined through clinical examination of the udder and using mastitis indicator paper (Bovivet indicator paper, Kruuse, Denmark). The prevalence of mastitis at cow and quarter level was 30.3 (61/201) and 10.3 (79/766), respectively. Subclinical mastitis was 25.4% and 5.0% was clinical. Stage of lactation significantly affected (P < 0.05) the prevalence of mastitis, with the highest prevalence observed in the late stage of lactation (41.3%) as compared to early (25.0%) and mid (22.1%) stages of lactation. Floor type and bedding had association (P < 0.05) with mastitis prevalence. Cows housed in concrete-floored houses had lower prevalence (19.0%) of mastitis compared to cows kept in soil-floored houses (47.6%). Mastitis prevalence was low in farms which do not use bedding (23.5%) as compared to farms using hay/straw bedding (37.4%). However, age, parity, and history of mastitis had no association (P > 0.05) on the prevalence of mastitis. The pathogens isolated from mastitic cows were Staphylococcus aureus (48.6%), other staphylococci species (15.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (11.4%), other streptococci (17.1%), Bacillus species (2.9%), and coliforms (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species) (4.3%). Strict hygienic measure of housing and bedding should be considered, in reducing the prevalence of mastitis.
TI  - Utilization of umbilical cord blood for the evaluation of group B streptococcal sepsis screening.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate reliability of umbilical cord blood (UCB) for complete blood count (CBC) and blood cultures compared with the infant's blood from peripheral site for group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis screening. METHODS: A total of 200 neonates, at risk for GBS infection, were studied prospectively. After birth, UCB sample was obtained for CBC and blood cultures from umbilical vein. Peripheral arterial/venous blood was obtained from the neonate. RESULTS: In 200 neonates, CBC counts were similar for clinical significance except for leukopenia (6% in UCB vs 1.2% in peripheral blood, P = .02). One UCB sample grew GBS and another grew microaerophilic streptococcus, a contaminant. A neonatal sample grew Escherichia coli, a pathogen and another neonatal sample grew Staphylococcus auricularis, a contaminant. CONCLUSION: CBC results were similar from UCB and the infant for the purpose of GBS screening. Contamination of UCB sample for culture is uncommon. Hence, UCB may be used for GBS sepsis screen.
TI  - A proposal of interpretive criteria for cefoperazone applicable to bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The correct assessment of mastitis pathogens for their susceptibility/resistance  to cefoperazone is currently hampered by the lack of harmonized test conditions and interpretive criteria. The aim of this study was to provide a proposal for clinical breakpoints of cefoperazone which are applicable to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis from cases of bovine mastitis and better reflect the situation in the bovine udder than breakpoints adopted from human medicine. For this, pharmacological data and clinical efficacy data of the documents submitted for approval of cefoperazone have been revisited. In addition, 1086 bacterial pathogens of the aforementioned six species/groups collected in Germany and in the USA during recent years were tested in parallel for their cefoperazone MICs and the zone diameters using a 75 mug disk. Subsequently, MICs were plotted against zone diameters. Based on the pharmacological data, the clinical efficacy and the microbiological data, a proposal was made for veterinary-specific breakpoints which classify members of the aforementioned species/groups as (a) susceptible to cefoperazone when their MIC is </= 2 mug/ml and their zone diameters are >/= 27 mm (staphylococci or E. coli) or >/= 21 mm (streptococci), (b) intermediate when their MIC is 4 mug/ml and their zone diameters are 22-26 mm (staphylococci or E. coli) or 16-20mm (streptococci), and (c) resistant when their MIC is >/= 8 mug/ml and their zone diameters are </= 21 mm (staphylococci or E. coli) or </= 15 mm (streptococci).
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - An in silico model for identification of small RNAs in whole bacterial genomes: characterization of antisense RNAs in pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae strains.
AB  - Characterization of small non-coding ribonucleic acids (sRNA) among the large volume of data generated by high-throughput RNA-seq or tiling microarray analyses remains a challenge. Thus, there is still a need for accurate in silico prediction methods to identify sRNAs within a given bacterial species. After years of effort, dedicated software were developed based on comparative genomic analyses or mathematical/statistical models. Although these genomic analyses enabled sRNAs in intergenic regions to be efficiently identified, they all failed to predict antisense sRNA genes (asRNA), i.e. RNA genes located on the DNA strand complementary to that which encodes the protein. The statistical models enabled any genomic region to be analyzed theorically but not efficiently. We present a new model for in silico identification of sRNA and asRNA candidates within an entire bacterial genome. This model was successfully used to analyze the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Streptococcus agalactiae. In both bacteria, numerous asRNAs are transcribed from the complementary strand of genes located in pathogenicity islands, strongly suggesting that these asRNAs are regulators of the virulence expression. In particular, we characterized an asRNA that acted as an enhancer-like regulator of the type 1 fimbriae production involved in the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli.
TI  - Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of the human keratin 4-binding domain of serine-rich repeat protein 1 from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Serine-rich repeat protein 1 (Srr-1) is a surface protein from Streptococcus agalactiae. A 17 kDa region of this protein has been identified to bind to human keratin 4 (K4) and is termed the Srr-1 K4-binding domain (Srr-1-K4BD). Recombinant Srr-1-K4BD was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Native and selenomethionine-substituted proteins were prepared using Luria-Bertani (LB) and M9 minimal media, respectively. A two-step purification protocol was carried out to obtain a final homogenous sample of Srr-1-K4BD. Crystals of native Srr-1-K4BD were obtained using PEG 3350 as a precipitant. The crystals diffracted to 3.8 A resolution using synchrotron radiation and belonged to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 47.56, b = 59.48, c = 94.71 A, beta = 93.95 degrees .
TI  - Late-onset neonatal infections: incidences and pathogens in the era of antenatal  antibiotics.
AB  - Widespread use of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis has significantly reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal infection (EONI); however, little is known about the effects of increased maternal exposure to antibiotics on late-onset neonatal infection (LONI). This study aims to evaluate LONI epidemiology in our region after the application of French recommendations and to determine whether LONI-causing organisms and their antibiotic susceptibility are influenced by peripartum antibiotic exposure. We performed a prospective epidemiologic study of 139 confirmed and possible cases of bacterial LONI in patients treated with antibiotics for at least 5 days of the 22,458 infants born in our region in the year 2007. The overall incidence of LONI caused by all pathogens, Group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were 6.19, 0.36 and 2.72, respectively, per 1,000 live births. Our findings revealed three major types of LONI: E. coli-induced urinary tract infection (UTI) among term infants, coagulase negative Staphylococcus septicemia affecting preterm infants, and GBS infections with severe clinical presentation. Univariable analysis revealed that maternal antibiotic exposure was significantly associated with the risk of amoxicillin-resistant E. coli infection (p = 0.01). Postnatal antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased risk of E. coli LONI (p = 0.048). This link persisted upon multivariable analysis; however, no additional risk factors were identified for LONI caused by antibiotic-resistant E. coli. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that despite the benefits of antenatal antibiotics, this treatment can increase the risk of antibiotic-resistant cases of LONI. National and international surveillance of LONI epidemiology is essential to assess benefits and potential negative consequences of perinatal antibiotic exposure.
TI  - Microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  - PURPOSE: Collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. In order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. METHODS: In a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from January 2009 to October 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. All the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. Cultures for common bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. RESULTS: The most frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. In particular, streptococci were found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. U. urealyticum was detected in 10% and Mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). No cases of N. gonorrhoeae were found. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical culture has a low concordance with endometrial culture. In fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. These results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.
TI  - Multiplex PCR and a chromogenic DNA macroarray for the detection of Listeria monocytogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens in milk and meat samples.
AB  - Food products, such as milk and meat products including cheese, milk powder, fermented milk, sausage, etc. are susceptible to the contamination by pathogenic and deteriorative bacteria. These bacteria include Listeria monocytogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas fluorescens, etc. Traditional methods for the detection of these microorganisms are laborious and time consuming. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed. In this study, we designed the DNA probes and PCR primers for the detection of aforementioned microorganisms. By using two sets of multiplex PCR, followed by a chromogenic macroarray system, these organisms in milk or other food products could be simultaneously detected. When the system was used for the inspection of milk or meat homogenate containing 10(0) target cells per milliliter or gram of the sample, all these bacterial species could be identified after an 8h pre-enrichment step. The system consisting of a multiplex PCR step followed by macroarray allowed us to detect multiple target bacterial species simultaneously without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared to the commonly used multiplex PCR method, this approach has the additional advantage of detecting more bacterial strains because some bacterial strains generate PCR products with the same molecular sizes which can be differentiated by macroarray but not by electrophoresis.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for species identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop and evaluate a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneous detection of 10 bacterial species causing bovine mastitis namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli in milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A two-tube mPCR assay was developed. The accuracy of the mPCR was evaluated using 56 standard reference strains and 705 strains comprising of E. coli (n = 99), staphylococci (n = 522) and streptococci (n = 84). The threshold of detection of the mPCR assay was 10 fg of genomic DNA and <10(3) CFU ml(-1). A comparative evaluation of mPCR with culture method using 115 milk samples from subclinical mastitis showed mPCR to be more efficacious. Subsequently, the mPCR showed successful detection of target bacteria, when applied directly for the assessment of 36 bulk milk samples. CONCLUSION: The developed mPCR assay was found to be simple, rapid, reliable and specific in species identification of 10 bacteria at a time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay will be useful for the detection of mastitis, testing bacteriological safety of milk and for species level differentiation. The assay will be of value in the dairy sector for diagnosis and research. The early and accurate identification of pathogens will enable timely interventions for the treatment and control of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  - Mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. Many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or Staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. A wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies level. These include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. The strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. Molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and disease causation. In this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Cellular compatibility of biomineralized ZnO nanoparticles based on prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.
AB  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with the size of approximately 100 nm were prepared via a facile biomineralization process in the template of silk fibroin (SF) peptide at room temperature. These ZnO NPs have shown the remarkable behavior of low toxicity to gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), and eukaryotic cells (mouse L929 fibroblasts). Bacteriological testing indicated that ZnO NPs presented a 50% inhibitory effect on Streptococcus agalactiae at the concentrations of >100 mM, whereas at the same concentrations, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were hardly inhibited. On the other hand, a remarkable proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli was observed at the concentrations of ZnO NPs <50 mM. Moreover, the cytotoxicity test demonstrated that ZnO NPs mineralized with SF peptide possessed a low toxicity to mouse L929 fibroblasts. The SF peptide coated on the surface of ZnO NPs permitted greater adhesion and consequently greater proliferation of mouse L929 fibroblasts. Besides, from TEM micrographs of the cell ultrastructure, endocytosis of NPs into the cytoplasm can be detected and the ultrastructure of the cell underwent few changes. The cell membrane retained integrity, euchromatin dispersed homogenously inside the cytoplasm, the mitochondrial architecture remained intact, and no intracellular vacuoles were observed. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and selected area electron diffraction patterns of ultrathin cell sections indicated that the crystal structure of NPs was not damaged by the organelle or cytoplasm. All these observations indicated that ZnO NPs mineralized with the SF peptide possess good cytocompatibility.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Risk factors associated with short-term post-treatment outcomes of clinical mastitis.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to characterize 60-d outcomes after treatment of mild (abnormal milk) and moderate (abnormal milk and abnormal udder) cases of clinical mastitis (CM) occurring in a single quarter of cows on Wisconsin farms (n=4) and to determine risk factors associated with those outcomes. Duplicate milk samples were collected from the affected quarter of each cow for microbiological analysis at the onset of CM (PRE) and 21 d later (POST). Cows were treated only in the affected quarter using an intramammary product containing 125 mg of ceftiofur. Bacteriological cure was defined as absence of pathogens in the POST sample obtained from the enrolled quarter. Recurrence was defined for the cow when CM occurred after the milk-withholding period for the enrolled case of CM. Retention in the herd was defined when a cow was retained within the herd for the 60-d follow-up period. Somatic cell count reduction (SCCR) was defined at the cow level as somatic cell count (SCC) below 200,000 cells/mL at the Dairy Herd Improvement Association test day occurring between 21 to 55 d post-treatment. The effects of farm, days in milk, parity, severity, microbiological diagnosis at PRE, previous milk yield, previous SCC, previous occurrence of CM and treatment duration on selected post-treatment outcomes were assessed using Chi-squared analysis and logistic regression. Microbiological results at PRE were distributed as: Escherichia coli (n=14), Klebsiella spp. (n=11), Enterobacter spp. (n=8), Serratia spp. (n=7), other gram-negative species (n=3), Streptococcus spp. (n=25), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=4); Staphylococcus aureus (n=1); Streptococcus agalactiae (n=1), other gram-positive species (n=9), and culture negative (n=60). Treated quarters were more likely to experience bacteriological cure when the cow experienced CM for the first time in the lactation and when no pathogen was recovered from PRE milk samples obtained from the enrolled quarter. Parity and bacteriological cure were associated with the probability of recurrence. Greater milk yield at previous Dairy Herd Improvement test was the most important predictor for retention within the herd. When SCC before CM was >200,000 cells/mL the probability of having SCCR after treatment was decreased. When the case experienced bacteriological cure, the cow was less likely to experience recurrent cases and was more likely to have SCCR below 200,000 cells/mL. Post-treatment outcomes, such as recurrence and SCCR, are strongly associated with bacteriological cure and, when monitored, can be used to help determine if a treatment has been successful. Information about the etiology of CM, history of clinical and subclinical mastitis, and parity are useful to review when making strategic treatment decisions.
TI  - The burden of invasive early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States, 2005-2008.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis in the first 3 days of life is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants. Group B Streptococcus (GBS), historically the primary cause of early-onset sepsis (EOS), has declined through widespread use of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. We estimated the national burden of invasive EOS cases and deaths in the era of GBS prevention. METHODS: Population-based surveillance for invasive EOS was conducted in 4 of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Active Bacterial Core surveillance sites from 2005 to 2008. We calculated incidence using state and national live birth files. Estimates of the national number of cases and deaths were calculated, standardizing by race and gestational age. RESULTS: Active Bacterial Core surveillance identified 658 cases of EOS; 72 (10.9%) were fatal. Overall incidence remained stable during the 3 years (2005: 0.77 cases/1000 live births; 2008: 0.76 cases/1000 live births). GBS ( approximately 38%) was the most commonly reported pathogen followed by Escherichia coli ( approximately 24%). Black preterm infants had the highest incidence (5.14 cases/1000 live births) and case fatality (24.4%). Nonblack term infants had the lowest incidence (0.40 cases/1000 live births) and case fatality (1.6%). The estimated national annual burden of EOS was approximately 3320 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3060-3580), including 390 deaths (95% CI: 300-490). Among preterm infants, 1570 cases (95% CI: 1400-1770; 47.3% of the overall) and 360 deaths (95% CI: 280-460; 92.3% of the overall) occurred annually. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of invasive EOS remains substantial in the era of GBS prevention and disproportionately affects preterm and black infants. Identification of strategies to prevent preterm births is needed to reduce the neonatal sepsis burden.
TI  - The changing face of early-onset neonatal sepsis after the implementation of a maternal group B Streptococcus screening and intrapartum prophylaxis policy--a study in one medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-onset sepsis (EOS) is the major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) were implemented in our hospital in 2004. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and changes in pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility. METHODS: The medical charts of mothers and infants with EOS between January 2001 and November 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. EOS was defined as sepsis occurring within 72 hours of birth. Data were pooled and compared for January 2001 through September 2004 (Period 1, without GBS screening) and October 2004 through November 2008 (Period 2, with GBS screening and IAP). RESULTS: The GBS screening rate increased from 10.11% in 2004 to 65% in 2008 and the IAP rate increased from 40% in 2004 to 90% in 2008. The most common EOS pathogen in Period 1 was GBS (45.4%), which decreased to 20% in Period 2 (p=0.081; trend p=0.009). The percentage of EOS because of Escherichia coli in Period 1 was 40.9% but increased to 70% in Period 2 (p=0.059). E coli EOS increased in extremely low birth weight premature babies weighing 500-1000g from Period 1 to Period 2 (p=0.031). The incidence of ampicillin-resistant E coli EOS was relatively high, but no significant change (88.9% vs. 92.9%) after implementation of GBS screening and IAP was noted. CONCLUSION: GBS screening plus IAP is effective in decreasing the incidence of GBS EOS; however, an increase in EOS caused by E coli was noted. Monitoring of pathogens causing EOS is important for effective treatment.
TI  - Assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  - Despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. One key component of better control of this disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. Mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. Development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial DNA extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples to complement traditional microbiological identification. Extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. The following species were identified: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Klebsiella spp. (including Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The detection procedure includes specific genomic DNA amplification by multiplex PCR for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. The specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. The extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. The analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/mL for milk samples spiked with Staph. aureus, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli, with a tendency for K. pneumoniae. The detection limit was 500 cfu/mL for Strep. uberis and Strep. agalactiae. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. When the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, DNA purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. Of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive Staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16S sequencing. The proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated PCR detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.
TI  - Early onset neonatal sepsis: the burden of group B Streptococcal and E. coli disease continues.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines for prevention of group B streptococcal (GBS) infection have successfully reduced early onset (EO) GBS disease. Study results suggest that Escherichia coli is an important EO pathogen. OBJECTIVE: To determine EO infection rates, pathogens, morbidity, and mortality in a national network of neonatal centers. METHODS: Infants with EO infection were identified by prospective surveillance at Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Network centers. Infection was defined by positive culture results for blood and cerebrospinal fluid obtained from infants aged </=72 hours plus treatment with antibiotic therapy for >/=5 days. Mother and infant characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were studied. Numbers of cases and total live births (LBs) were used to calculate incidence. RESULTS: Among 396 586 LBs (2006-2009), 389 infants developed EO infection (0.98 cases per 1000 LBs). Infection rates increased with decreasing birth weight. GBS (43%, 0.41 per 1000 LBs) and E coli (29%, 0.28 per 1000 LBs) were most frequently isolated. Most infants with GBS were term (73%); 81% with E coli were preterm. Mothers of 67% of infected term and 58% of infected preterm infants were screened for GBS, and results were positive for 25% of those mothers. Only 76% of mothers with GBS colonization received intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. Although 77% of infected infants required intensive care, 20% of term infants were treated in the normal newborn nursery. Sixteen percent of infected infants died, most commonly with E coli infection (33%). CONCLUSION: In the era of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis to reduce GBS, rates of EO infection have declined but reflect a continued burden of disease. GBS remains the most frequent pathogen in term infants, and E coli the most significant pathogen in preterm infants. Missed opportunities for GBS prevention continue. Prevention of E coli sepsis, especially among preterm infants, remains a challenge.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of oral topical agents on microorganisms associated with radiated head and neck cancer patients: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A variety of oral topical agents have been used for prevention and management of radiotherapy-induced adverse effects. The antimicrobial nature of some of the commonly used agents is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial efficacies of various oral topical agents on common microorganisms associated with radiated head and neck cancer patients. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Seven commonly used topical oral agents-0.12% chlorhexidine with alcohol, 0.12% chlorhexidine without alcohol, baking soda-salt rinse, 0.4% stannous fluoride gel, 0.63% stannous fluoride rinse, calcium phosphate mouthrinse, and acemannan hydrogel (aloe vera) rinse-were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial efficacies against four common microorganisms. A combination of baking soda-salt rinse and 0.4% stannous fluoride gel was evaluated as the eighth agent. The microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. An ELISA reader was used to measure the turbidity of microbial culture wells and optical density (OD) values for each of the 960 wells recorded. Mean OD values were rank ordered based on their turbidity. One-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc analysis was used to study differences in OD values (P < .05). RESULTS: Mean OD values classified for topical agents from lowest to highest were chlorhexidine with alcohol, chlorhexidine without alcohol, baking soda- salt, calcium phosphate rinse, and the combination of baking soda-salt and stannous fluoride gel. Mean OD values classified for microorganisms from lowest to highest were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, group B Streptococcus, and Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: A significant difference among the antimicrobial efficacies of topical agents was evident for each of four microorganisms (P < .05). There was also a significant difference among the antimicrobial efficacies of the same topical agent on the four microorganisms tested (P < .05).
TI  - Influence of storage and preservation on microbiological quality of silo ovine milk.
AB  - This study was designed to analyze the effects of the storage and preservation conditions on counts of mesophilic, thermoduric, psychotrophic, coliform, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus organisms in silo ovine milk. A total of 910 analytical determinations were conducted from aliquots of 10 silo ovine milks. The conditions tested were unpreserved and azidiol-preserved milk stored at 4 degrees C, and unpreserved milk stored at -20 degrees C. Milk aged 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-collection for refrigerated aliquots, and 7, 15, and 30 d post-collection for frozen aliquots. The factors silo and storage conditions significantly contributed to variation of all microbiological variables, although milk age effect within storage was only significant for mesophilic, psychrotrophic, and coliform bacteria counts. In refrigerated raw milk, mesophile, psychrotroph, and coliform counts significantly increased over 96 h post-collection, whereas the other groups and bacteria species tested maintained their initial concentration. In all cases, azidiol preservation maintained the initial bacterial concentration in raw sheep milk under refrigeration throughout 96 h. Thus, azidiol was a suitable preservative for microbiological studies in sheep milk. Smallest counts were registered for frozen samples, particularly for coliforms, E. coli, Strep. agalactiae and Staph. aureus. Estimates of mesophilic, thermoduric and psychrotrophic organisms showed similar values on both azidiol-preserved and frozen milk samples. Coliforms and E. coli counts significantly decrease over time after freezing. Consequently, freezing at -20 degrees C could also be appropriate for analysis of mesophilic, thermoduric, and psychrotrophic bacterial groups, but not for coliforms or mammary pathogens.
TI  - Severe vulvovaginitis as a presenting problem of type 2 diabetes in adolescent girls: a case series.
AB  - This article describes the presentation of 4 adolescent girls who sought medical  attention for severe vulvovaginitis and were subsequently found to have type 2 diabetes. Symptomatic vulvovaginitis is rare in adolescent girls, and its presence should alert health care providers to test for underlying hyperglycemia. These 4 girls represent 8.5% of the females with new-onset type 2 diabetes during a 3-year period (2007-2009). The 4 cases fulfilled the current Canadian Diabetes Association screening criteria for type 2 diabetes in youth, yet none of these girls had been screened. These cases highlight the need for better awareness of screening criteria for type 2 diabetes in adolescents. Consideration should be given in clinical practice guidelines to including the presence of unusual or severe infections as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes in youth.
TI  - The effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on Staphylococcus aureus DMST 4745.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (LG) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on S. aureus biofilm formation. Attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological changes of S. aureus DMST 4745 were also made. The results demonstrate that S. agalactiae and B. cereus are more susceptible to LG, citral and geraniol than S. aureus and E. coli. Moreover, they also inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. The LG appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.
TI  - Human papillomaviruses prevalence and genital co-infections in HIV-seropositive women in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso).
AB  - The vaginal swabs among HIV-positive women in Africa often revealed opportunistic infections such as human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Mycoplasma that induce respectively cervix cancer and diseases such as vaginosis, abortions, infertility in through salpingitis. The purposes of this study were to: (1) seek for, the prevalence of pathogens such as HPV and Mycoplasma; (2) characterize the strains of HPV and estimate their prevalence; (3) identify among these women, those who were co-infected by these pathogens in order to cure them. From February 2009 to January 2010, 156 HIV-positive women attending our medical centers and aged from 19-45 years (mean age 33.65 +/- 5.75 years) had voluntarily accepted vaginal specimen's tests. PCR, ELISA and molecular hybridization were used for the identification and characterization of these pathogens. The results revealed the presence of Mycoplasma and HPV in 25.64 and 58.33% cases, respectively. The following HPV genotypes and the following prevalence were recorded: HPV-50'S (24.11%), HPV-18 (21.28%), HPV-30'S (18.44%) and HPV-16 (5.67%). The study also enable the identification of co-infections such as HPV-18 strains with HPV-30'S (5.67%) and HPV-30'S with HPV-50'S (3.55%). Other germs infecting the female genital tract including Candida albicans (20.51%), Escherichia coli (12.18%), Treponema pallidum (3.85%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3.21%) and Staphylococcus aureus (1.92%) were isolated. This preliminary research work showed the incidence of several genital pathogens, this could be a springboard for nationwide epidemiological study on HPV strains circulating in Burkina Faso.
TI  - Udder pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in Estonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to estimate the distribution of udder pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in Estonia during the years 2007-2009. METHODS: The bacteriological findings reported in this study originate from quarter milk samples collected from cows on Estonian dairy farms that had clinical or subclinical mastitis. The samples were submitted by local veterinarians to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Laboratory during 2007-2009. Milk samples were examined by conventional bacteriology. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the disc diffusion test. Logistic regression with a random herd effect to control for clustering was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 3058 clinical mastitis samples from 190 farms and 5146 subclinical mastitis samples from 274 farms were investigated. Positive results were found in 57% of the samples (4680 out of 8204), and the proportion did not differ according to year (p > 0.05). The proportion of bacteriologically negative samples was 22.3% and that of mixed growth was 20.6%. Streptococcus uberis (Str. uberis) was the bacterium isolated most frequently (18.4%) from cases of clinical mastitis, followed by Escherichia coli (E. coli) (15.9%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (Str. agalactiae) (11.9%). The bacteria that caused subclinical mastitis were mainly Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (20%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (15.4%). The probability of isolating S. aureus from milk samples was significantly higher on farms that had fewer than 30 cows, when compared with farms that had more than 100 cows (p < 0.005). A significantly higher risk of Str. agalactiae infection was found on farms with more than 600 cows (p = 0.034) compared with smaller farms. The proportion of S. aureus and CNS isolates that were resistant to penicillin was 61.4% and 38.5%, respectively. Among the E. coli isolates, ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline resistance were observed in 24.3%, 15.6% and 13.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the main pathogens associated with clinical mastitis were Str. uberis and E. coli. Subclinical mastitis was caused mainly by S. aureus and CNS. The number of S. aureus and Str. agalactiae isolates depended on herd size. Antimicrobial resistance was highly prevalent, especially penicillin resistance in S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Development of a rapid PCR assay for screening of maternal colonization by group  B streptococcus and neonatal invasive Escherichia coli during labor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichiacoli(E. coli) are the leading causes of early-onset neonatal disease (EOD). Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of GBS-colonized women decreases vertical transmission and EOD due to GBS. Nevertheless, no intervention has been developed to reduce the risk of EOD related to E. coli. Timely and accurate identification of colonized mothers is necessary to implement preventive strategies against neonatal sepsis. To screen for colonization during labor, we developed a real-time PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of GBS and neonatal invasive strains of E. coli. STUDY DESIGN: Specific DNA targets for GBS are publicly available. For neonatal invasive E. coli, we analyzed candidate DNA targets by DNA hybridization on microarrays of invasive strains isolated from neonatal E. coli sepsis or meningitis (K1 and not K1 'invasive' serotypes). Specificity of DNA probes was tested against a panel of bacteria and by simulating clinical conditions (spiking vaginal samples from pregnant women). Then, the characteristics of the selected probes were evaluated in a pilot study including 200 women in labor. RESULTS: Prevalence of rectovaginal GBS and of vaginal and cervical E. coliserotype K1 colonization were 16.0, 3.5 and 3.5% by culture and 27, 10 and 8.5% by PCR, respectively. The prevalence of other invasive E. coli in the vagina and in the cervix, detected by PCR, was around 10%. Compared to the culture, considered as the gold standard, the sensitivities of the PCRs for the GBS and E. coli K1 were 97 and 71%, respectively. Specificities were 86 and 92%, respectively. Specificity is difficult to interpret, as a false-positive PCR result may in fact be a false-negative result of the culture. The turnaround time needed for PCR analysis was 2.5 h, compared to a minimum of 48 h for the culture. CONCLUSION: Our rapid PCR is reliable in detecting GBS in women in labor. Optimization of the PCR for invasive E. coli is needed before its implementation in clinical practice. More efforts to fight against main causes of neonatal sepsis need to be undertaken to prevent this terrible medical complication.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Kill rate of mastitis pathogens by a combination of cefalexin and kanamycin.
AB  - AIM: To assess the bacterial killing rate produced by a combination of cefalexin  and kanamycin at two different concentration ratios. METHODS AND RESULTS: Time-kill kinetics of cefalexin and kanamycin, individually and in combination, were determined against one strain each of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. The combination was tested using two fixed ratios (cefalexin : kanamycin ratios of 1.25 : 1 and 1 : 2.3) and two concentrations of each ratio. Time-kill curves produced with either ratio were quite similar. Against most bacterial species, higher concentrations produced faster kill. In all cases, the combination of cefalexin and kanamycin showed faster and greater kill at lower antibiotic concentrations than those observed with either drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cefalexin and kanamycin results in a fast initial killing of major mastitis pathogens at both concentration ratios. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The combination of cefalexin and kanamycin achieved rapid bacterial kill at concentrations and ratios that can be achieved in vivo following intramammary infusion of a mastitis treatment.
TI  - Etiology and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of community- and hospital-acquired urinary tract infections in a general hospital in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the bacterial profile and prevalence of antibiotic resistance patterns of uropathogens, as well as evaluate the problem with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing isolates, causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Al-Amiri Hospital, Kuwait, over a 3-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolates (56,505) from symptomatic UTI cases from January 2005 to December 2007 were identified by conventional methods and the VITEK identification card system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method for Gram-positive organisms and an automated VITEK 2 machine for Gram-negative organisms. ESBL production by the Enterobacteriaceae was detected by the double-disk diffusion method and VITEK-2 system. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was detected in 15,064 (26.6%) of the 56,505 urine samples. Escherichia coli accounted for 4,876 (54.9%) from community-acquired UTI (CA-UTI) and 2,253 (36.4%) from hospital-acquired UTI (HA-UTI), followed by Streptococcus agalactiae (1,129, 12.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (962, 10.8%) from CA-UTI cases. Candida spp. (973, 15.7%) and K. pneumoniae (747, 12.1%) were the second and third most prevalent isolates, respectively, in HA-UTI. High resistance rates were observed among the Enterobacteriaceae against ampicillin, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. About 855 (12%) and 291 (17%) of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively, were resistant to >/=4 antibiotics. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in CA-UTI was 12 and 17% and in HA-UTI 26 and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of the uropathogens causing UTI in the Al-Amiri Hospital setting was highly resistant to the first- and second-line antibiotics for the therapy of UTI. ESBL-producing bacteria are highly prevalent in our hospital.
TI  - [Prevention of early-onset group B Streptococcus infections. 2. Efficiency of the ANAES guidelines].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficiency on early-onset neonatal infections of the ANAES guidelines for early-onset infections prophylaxis, based on a systematic prenatal vaginal swab aiming Group B Streptococcus and/or infection risk factors during delivery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of early-onset infections during a period of 28 months (6125 deliveries) compared to an earlier period (6141 deliveries). RESULTS: The number of newborns admitted for suspected infection and the rate of sepsis have been unchanged. But the total number of infections has decreased (1.50 vs 2.02 %, p=0,024), without increase of the number of infections due to other germs such as Escherichia coli. Furthermore, a strategy based only on risk factors would not have allowed the early screening and treatment of 23 Streptococcus B infected newborns. CONCLUSION: We have proved the efficiency of the protocol in terms of prevention of early-onset infections. However, it has led to a dramatic increase in the consumption of antibiotics, which is worrying concerning maternal and neonatal bacterial ecology.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against Stx1B subunit of Escherichia coli O157:H7 distinguish the bacterium from other bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The Shiga-like toxins (Stx) are critical virulence factors of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Stx1B subunit plays important roles in EHEC infection. This work aims to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the Stx1B and to investigate their utility in discrimination ELISA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two newly identified mAbs (designated 2H8 and 1B10, respectively) against the Stx1B protein were prepared via hybridoma techniques. The immunoreactivity of both mAbs to the Stx1B protein was confirmed in ELISA and Western blot. Moreover, they differentiate EHEC from Salmonella enteritis, non-Stx1-producing E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-STx1B mAbs are valuable diagnostic reagents for distinguishing EHEC from other bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report regarding the usage of anti-STx1B mAbs in discrimination ELISA. The established ELISA may have potential in clinical surveillance of EHEC infection.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Vaccination with peptide mimotopes produces antibodies recognizing bacterial capsular polysaccharides.
AB  - A phage display peptide library was screened using a panel of antibodies to the capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus agalactiae and Neisseria meningitidis. Mimotopes NPDHPRVPTFMA (2-8), LIPFHKHPHHRG (3-2) and EQEIFTNITDRV (G3) showing the highest binding capacity and strongest ELISA reaction were selected for immunization experiments. These mimotopes were either synthesised as oligodeoxynucleotides for DNA immunization or MAP (multiple antigen peptide) for peptide immunization. Mimotope-DNA vaccination, particularly for G3, induced antibodies recognizing a number of target bacteria. This response was seen after the second boost injection and was significantly enhanced by the 3rd boost injection with a Th1-associated profile, which was dominated by IgG2a, followed by IgG1. Mimotope-MAP immunization also produced strong humoral immune responses to the bacteria. Antibodies from G3 DNA immunization reacted with the surface molecules of S. agalactiae, N. meningitidis and Escherichia coli K5 shown by indirect immunofluorescence staining, indicating a possible localization to the bacterial capsule. Antibodies produced both from DNA/MAP immunization reacted with purified bacterial capsular polysaccharides by ELISA and were of high avidity. We have further characterized peptide G3 by a 'tiling path' study to examine the effect of changing individual residues in the peptide in raising antibodies, which showed that the EIFTN motif in G3 was important in generating antibodies to several capsulated bacteria. We conclude that mimotope immunization with DNA or MAP potentially induces strong antibody responses against encapsulated bacteria. It is suggested that the antibody targets are polysaccharides, and these antibodies may cross react at least among closely related species of bacteria.
TI  - Linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of L. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. METHOD: In vitro antimicrobial activity of L. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and MIC determination. The in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the California mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. In the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the California mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. The microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. The effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (Mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible therapeutic potential of L. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
TI  - The treatment and outcome of postmeningitic subdural empyema in infants.
AB  - OBJECT: The management of subdural empyema (SDE) has been debated in the literature for decades. Craniotomy and bur hole drainage have been shown to achieve a favorable outcome. However, there is a lack of comparative data for these modes of management of SDE subsequent to meningitis in infants. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 33 infants identified with SDE due to meningitis at the Department of Neurosurgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 2000 and 2006. Preoperative clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, radiological investigations, CSF data, and postoperative outcome were analyzed and compared between these 2 surgical groups. RESULTS: At diagnosis, there were no differences between the groups in age, weight, degree of consciousness, CSF analysis, or duration of fever. The outcome data showed no difference in the number of days until afebrile, number of days of postsurgical antibiotic treatment, neurological outcome, recurrence rate, or complication rate. There was only 1 death in the series. CONCLUSIONS: Subdural empyema due to meningitis in infants is unique with respect to the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of SDE. Early detection and removal of SDE provide a favorable outcome in both surgical intervention groups. Bur hole drainage is less invasive, and it is possible to expect a clinical outcome as good as with craniotomy in postmeningitic SDE.
TI  - Inter-alpha inhibitor protein administration improves survival from neonatal sepsis in mice.
AB  - Inter-alpha inhibitor proteins (IaIp) are serine proteases inhibitors that modulate endogenous protease activity and have been shown to improve survival in adult models of sepsis. We evaluated the effect of IaIp on survival and systemic responses to sepsis in neonatal mice. Sepsis was induced in 2-d-old mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Escherichia coli, and group B Streptococci. Sepsis was associated with 75% mortality. IaIp, given by i.p. administration at doses between 15 and 45 mg/kg from 1 to 6 h after the onset of sepsis, improved survival to approximately 90% (p = 0.0159) in both LPS-induced sepsis and with live bacterial infections. The greatest effect was on reversal of hemorrhagic pneumonitis. The effects were dose and time dependent. Systemic cytokine profile and tissue histology were examined. Survival was compared in IL-10 knock out animals. Systemic cytokine levels including TNF-[alpha] and IL-10 were increased after induction of sepsis and modulated significantly after IaIp administration. Because the effect of IaIp was still demonstrable in IL-10 deficient mice, we conclude the beneficial effects of IaIp is because of suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-[alpha] rather than augmentation of IL-10. IaIp may offer significant benefits as a therapeutic
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (BM). BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. Despite its high mortality rate, BM has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. STUDY: BM patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and 2008, were studied. BM was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in CSF. RESULTS: We identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had BM. The mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. Abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. The sensitivity of CSF culture was 75% (Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; Staphylococcus aureus, 2; Listeria monocytogenes, 1; Group B Streptococcus, 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, 1; Streptococcus bovis, 1; and Escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. Five patients died. On admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dL. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL was associated with increased mortality (P=0.028). The model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dL, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of CSF were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BM in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. The clinical and microbiologic features of BM in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.
TI  - Microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (Provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling Provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of these voice prostheses. Over a 5-year period, implantation of a Provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. In total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. Out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. The most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was C. albicans, followed by C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The most frequently isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. The mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. Dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. The longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. There is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the device life time.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Comparison of Copan eSwab with the Copan Venturi Transystem for the quantitative  survival of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans.
AB  - Swab transport systems should preserve the viability and stability of micro-organisms in clinical specimens throughout transport and storage. eSwab, a nylon-tipped swab in liquid medium, designed for better specimen collection and less micro-organism entrapment, was evaluated for the maintenance of viability and quantitative survival of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans. The quantitative elution method was used to evaluate eSwab in vitro. In vitro, the recovery of the three micro-organisms was higher in eSwab (97-100%) as compared to the Copan Venturi Transystem (CVT) (86-96%) at room temperature (RT) for time point 0 h and remained similar after 6 h. E. coli and C. albicans proliferated in both transport systems when preserved beyond 6 h. At 4 degrees C, the recovery of eSwab was higher (>94%) compared to CVT (77-94%) for the micro-organisms tested. eSwab did not only meet the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for microbiological transport devices, but as its recovery rate in vitro was higher than that of CVT, it might also enhance the sensitivity of bacterial culture in the future.
TI  - Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity-independent bactericidal activity of an IgG against Pseudomonas aeruginosa O6ad.
AB  - In addition to Ag recognition, some Abs are capable of killing target organisms in the absence of phagocytes and complement. In this study, we report that an anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa O6ad LPS IgG(1), tobacco-expressed human S20 IgG(1) (te-hS20), as well as its recombinant Fab and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fragments have cellular- and complement-independent bactericidal activity. te-hS20 and its Fab and scFv significantly reduced viability of P. aeruginosa O6ad in dose- and time-dependent manners in vitro and also showed lower levels of bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa PAO1, but had no activity against P. aeruginosa O10, Escherichia coli TG1, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The H chain and its Fd fragment both had significant Ag-binding and bactericidal activities against P. aeruginosa O6ad. Bactericidal activity was completely inhibited with specific LPS Ag, suggesting that Ag binding is involved in the bactericidal mechanism. Live/dead cell staining and electron microscopic observations indicate that the bactericidal effect was due to disruption of the cell wall and suggest inhibition of cell division. In addition to te-hS20, the Fab and scFv were also protective in vivo, as leukopenic mice had prolonged and improved survival after administration of these Ab fragments followed by challenge with P. aeruginosa O6ad cells at 80-90% lethal dose, supporting a bactericidal mechanism independent of phagocytes and complement. Understanding of the bactericidal mechanism will allow assessment of the potential for therapeutic application of these Abs.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20 against several micro-organisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities were determined using the microdilution method in 96-well culture plates. The biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against all the micro-organisms assayed, and for twelve of the eighteen micro-organisms (including the pathogenic Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were achieved for biosurfactant concentrations between 25 and 50 mg ml(-1). Furthermore, the biosurfactant showed antiadhesive activity against most of the micro-organisms evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities of biosurfactants obtained from lactobacilli against such a broad group of micro-organisms. Although the antiadhesive activity of biosurfactants isolated from lactic acid bacteria has been widely reported, their antimicrobial activity is quite unusual and has been described only in a few strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results obtained in this study regarding the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of this biosurfactant opens future prospects for its use against micro-organisms responsible for diseases and infections in the urinary, vaginal and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as in the skin, making it a suitable alternative to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - Epidemiology of pediatric community-acquired bloodstream infections in a children hospital in Paris, France, 2001 to 2008.
AB  - In 2001 to 2008, we documented 483 cases of pediatric community-acquired bacteremia mostly because of Streptococcus agalactiae (< 4 days), Escherichia coli (4 days to 3 months), pneumococci (3 months to 5 years), and Staphylococcus aureus (> 5 years). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination affected the serotype distribution of pneumococcal bacteremia but not its frequency. Serotype 19A represented 12% and 22% of pneumococci in the prevaccine and vaccine periods, respectively.
TI  - Evaluation, management, and outcome of focal bacterial infections (FBIs) in nontoxic infants under two months of age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Well-appearing young infants with focal bacterial infections present  to the emergency department (ED) and are often admitted for a sepsis evaluation of blood, urine, and spinal fluid. However, the risk of concomitant systemic infections (CSI) in this population is not well reported, specifically comparing febrile to afebrile infants. We hypothesized that afebrile, well-appearing infants under two months of age with a defined focal bacterial infection on exam have a very low risk of CSI. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at an urban, academic, tertiary care pediatric hospital ED on patients seen from January 2000-December 2005. Eligible infants were less than 60 days of age, well-appearing on exam, and with normal-for-age vital signs who presented with a focal bacterial infection on exam. Exclusion criteria included immunodeficiency, indwelling catheter, previous admission for bacterial infection, or current use of systemic antibiotics. Main study outcome was risk of CSI in febrile and afebrile groups. RESULTS: One hundred ninety seven patients were included in the study population. Of these, 39 were febrile and 158 were afebrile. Four patients had a documented CSI: one case of S. pneumoniae bacteremia and three cases of E. coli urinary tract infection. Of these 4 infants, 3 were febrile (7.7% CSI risk) and 1 was afebrile (0.6%). Febrile infants had a significantly higher risk of CSI (OR 13.1, 95% CI 1.3, 129.5). CONCLUSIONS: CSI is very uncommon in afebrile, well-appearing infants under 60 days of age with a focal bacterial infection.
TI  - Mechanisms of meningeal invasion by a bacterial extracellular pathogen, the example of Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. A few bacterial pathogens are able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans, a rare but dreadful disease. Surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae). The particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-CSF barrier. In vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. agalactiae to reach the CSF. N. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. Adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type IV pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. Recent work has shown that N. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex Par3/Par6/aPKC that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.
TI  - Cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with a history of preterm birth.
AB  - Preterm birth is associated with elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha at the maternal-fetal interface. Previous studies have suggested that women with a history of preterm birth produce aberrantly strong inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However many intrauterine infections in women are associated with pathogens including Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) that contain pro-inflammatory factors other than LPS. We evaluated whether peripheral blood leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth produce elevated amounts of TNFalpha upon stimulation with pathogens associated with preterm birth and if pre-treatment with aspirin, an anti-inflammatory medication, decreases the ex vivo production of this cytokine. Heat-killed bacteria elicited increased TNFalpha production from leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but no differences in TNFalpha production between leukocytes from women with preterm birth and control women with term birth were detected. In women who consumed aspirin each day for one week, TNFalpha production was increased in leukocytes from control women stimulated with Escherichia coli and U. urealyticum, but was reduced or unchanged in leukocytes from women with preterm birth. Similar trends were observed for a subset of samples stimulated with U. urealyticum and assayed for IL-6, IL-10, IL-1beta and TNFalpha by bead array. We conclude that leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth do not have elevated pro-inflammatory responses to pathogens, and that reproductive history is associated with different effects of aspirin on pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
TI  - Isolation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by Lactobacillus paracasei.
AB  - In this study, the crude biosurfactant produced by a Lactobacillus paracasei strain isolated in a Portuguese dairy industry was characterized. The minimum surface tension (41.8mN/m) and the critical micelle concentration (2.5mg/ml) obtained were found to be similar to the values previously reported for biosurfactants isolated from other lactobacilli. The biosurfactant was found to be stable to pH changes over a range from 6 to 10, being more effective at pH 7, and showed no loss of surface activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 120h. Although the biosurfactant chemical composition has not been determined yet, a fraction was isolated through acidic precipitation, which exhibited higher surface activity as compared with the crude biosurfactant. Furthermore, this isolated biosurfactant showed antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities against several pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, L. paracasei exhibited a strong autoaggregating phenotype, which was maintained after washing and resuspending the cells in PBS, meaning that this attribute must be related to cell surface components and not to excreted factors. The autoaggregation ability exhibited by this strain, together with the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties observed for this biosurfactant opens the possibility for its use as an effective probiotic strain.
TI  - Structure of laminin-binding adhesin (Lmb) from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Adhesion/invasion of pathogenic bacteria is a critical step in infection and is mediated by surface-exposed proteins termed adhesins. The crystal structure of recombinant Lmb, a laminin-binding adhesin from Streptococcus agalactiae, has been determined at 2.5 A resolution. Based on sequence and structural homology, Lmb was placed into the cluster 9 family of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transport system. The structural organization of Lmb closely resembles that of ABC-type solute-binding proteins (SBPs), in which two structurally related globular domains interact with each other to form a metal-binding cavity at the interface. The bound zinc in Lmb is tetrahedrally coordinated by three histidines and a glutamate from both domains. A comparison of Lmb with other metal transporters revealed an interesting feature of the dimerization of molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit in all zinc-binding transporters. A closer comparison of Lmb with the zinc-binding ZnuA from Escherichia coli and Synechocystis 6803 suggested that Lmb might undergo a unique structural rearrangement upon metal binding and release. The crystal structure of Lmb provides an impetus for further investigations into the molecular basis of laminin binding by human pathogens. Being ubiquitous in all serotypes of group B streptococcus (GBS), the structure of Lmb may direct the development of an efficient vaccine.
TI  - Early and late onset sepsis in late preterm infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is increasing worldwide, and late preterm births, which comprise more than 70% of all preterm births, account for much of the increase. Early and late onset sepsis results in significant mortality in extremely preterm infants, but little is known about sepsis outcomes in late preterm infants. METHODS: This is an observational cohort study of infants <121 days of age (119,130 infants less than or equal to 3 days of life and 106,142 infants between 4 and 120 days of life) with estimated gestational age at birth between 34 and 36 weeks, admitted to 248 neonatal intensive care units in the United States between 1996 and 2007. RESULTS: During the study period, the cumulative incidence of early and late onset sepsis was 4.42 and 6.30 episodes per 1000 admissions, respectively. Gram-positive organisms caused the majority of early and late onset sepsis episodes. Infants with early onset sepsis caused by Gram-negative rods and infants with late onset sepsis were more likely to die than their peers with sterile blood cultures (odds ratio [OR]: 4.39, 95% CI: 1.71-11.23, P = 0.002; and OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 2.35-4.84, P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Late preterm infants demonstrate specific infection rates, pathogen distribution, and mortality associated with early and late onset sepsis. The results of this study are generalizable to late preterm infants admitted to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Diversity in cytokine response to bacteria associated with preterm birth by fetal membranes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared cytokine and prostaglandin (PG) responses by fetal membranes stimulated with 4 different bacterial species associated with preterm birth (PTB). STUDY DESIGN: Fetal membranes (n = 13 from normal term cesarean sections [not in labor]) in an organ explant system were stimulated with heat-killed Ureaplasma parvum, Gardanerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus (GBS), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, and interferon-gamma) and PG (PGF(2alpha) and PGE(2)) concentrations were quantitated and compared. RESULTS: LPS and E coli increased all cytokine and PG productions compared with controls. Cytokine profiles were similar after G vaginalis and GBS stimulation. G vaginalis increased PGE(2), whereas GBS increased PGF(2alpha). U parvum demonstrated the mildest response with only IL-10 and TNF-alpha concentrations being higher with no detectible effect on PGs. CONCLUSION: Fetal membrane cytokine signatures of 4 different bacteria associated with PTB are distinct, suggesting that infection as a potential cause of PTB is not homogeneous in its presentation.
TI  - Clinical significance of cerebrospinal fluid inhibitory titers of antibiotics, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inhibitory titer (CSF-IT) of an antibiotic, which can be used to estimate the duration of time above the agent's MIC in the CSF, was introduced as one of the indices to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic selection in treating bacterial meningitis. The CSF-IT was determined via a microdilution method. A suspension of the causative organism was added to a tube containing twofold diluted CSF and double-concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth with supplement. The CSF-IT was determined by the maximum point without turbidity of medium after overnight incubation at 37 degrees C. Concerning the strain of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR), the killing rates of both meropenem and piperacillin were compared in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) model, in which human pharmacokinetics in CSF were simulated. Organisms recovered from the CSF in 37 treated clinical cases of bacterial meningitis were H. influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria meningitidis; in these cases, the CSF-IT ranged from 1: 8 to as high as 1: 4 096. In the in vitro PK model, the concentrations of both drugs were higher than the MICs over a period of 24 h; however, the killing rate of piperacillin was higher than that of meropenem, and bacterial regrowth was observed after the administration of meropenem. A CSF-IT value higher than 1: 32 indicates that the antibiotic concentration in the CSF exceeds the MIC for 24 h. The effect of piperacillin on BLNAR depends not only on the time above MIC of 24 h but also on the maximum concentration in the CSF.
TI  - Research of urinary tract infections in family medicine physicians' offices--empiric antimicrobial therapy of urinary tract infections--Croatian experience.
AB  - In the period between October 1st and November 30th, 2006, we investigated a total of 3188 episodes of UTI (802 among males; 2386 among females) recorded in 108 family medicine offices in 20 cities in Croatia. The most common UTIs in women were acute uncomplicated cystitis (62%), complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (14%), urethritis (9%), acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (6%), recurrent cystitis (5%), asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%) and recurrent pyelonephritis. The most common UTIs in men were complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (48%), urethritis (25%), prostatitis (24%) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%). Etiological diagnosis was made in 999 (31%) UTI episodes before antimicrobial therapy was given. The most frequently isolated causative pathogens were Escherichia coli (77%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), Klebsiella spp (3%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3%) and Enterobacter (1%). Antimicrobial drug was administered in 2939 (92.19%) UTI episodes, in 1940 (66.01%) as empirical therapy, and in 999 (34%) as targeted antimicrobial therapy. The most commonly administered drug in empirical therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent cystitis and urethritis in women was cephalexin, for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs in women co-amoxiclav, and for UTIs in males ciprofloxacin. The results of this research of 3188 UTI episodes in family medicine physicians' offices provide a confirmatory answer to question whether empirical antimicrobial therapy of UTI prescribed by Croatian family practitioners is in accordance with the national guidelines.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of intravenous ceftiofur sodium and concentration in body fluids of foals.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine pharmacokinetics of intravenous (i.v.) ceftiofur in foals, to compare ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and microbiologic assay for the measurement of ceftiofur concentrations, and to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftiofur against common equine bacterial pathogens. In a cross-over design, ceftiofur sodium was administered i.v. to six foals (1-2 days-of-age and 4-5 weeks-of-age) at dosages of 5 and 10 mg/kg. Subsequently, five doses of ceftiofur were administered i.v. to six additional foals between 1 and 5 days of age at a dose of 5 mg/kg q 12 h. Concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA), the acetamide derivative of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur-related metabolites were measured in plasma, synovial fluid, urine, and CSF by use of UPLC-MS/MS. A microbiologic assay was used to measure ceftiofur activity for a subset of plasma samples. Following i.v. administration of ceftiofur at a dose of 5 mg/kg to 1-2 day-old foals, DCA had a t(1/2) of 7.8 +/- 0.1 h, a body clearance of 74.4 +/- 8.4 mL/h/kg, and an apparent volume of distribution of 0.83 +/- 0.09 L/kg. After multiple i.v. doses at 5 mg/kg, DCA concentrations in CSF were significantly lower than concurrent plasma concentrations. Ceftiofur activity using a microbiologic assay significantly underestimated plasma concentrations of DCA. The MIC of ceftiofur required to inhibit growth of 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella spp, Klebsiella spp, and beta-hemolytic streptococci was <0.5 microg/mL. Intravenous administration of ceftiofur sodium at the rate of 5 mg/kg every 12 h would provide sufficient coverage for the treatment of susceptible bacterial isolates.
TI  - Acquisition of factor H by a novel surface protein on group B Streptococcus promotes complement degradation.
AB  - Binding of the host complement regulator, factor H (FH), by some pathogenic microbes constitutes an important virulence mechanism, whereby complement is broken down to help microbes survive in the host. Although it has been hypothesized for the past two decades that GBS type III binds FH via sialic acid present on its capsule, neither the binding of FH to GBS has been demonstrated nor the mechanism of interaction identified. We observed that FH bound to both wild-type and capsule or sialic acid-deficient GBS that were used as negative controls. Wild-type and acapsular GBS were incubated with serum or pure FH degraded almost 90% of C3b, suggesting that the GBS-bound FH maintained cofactor activity. In addition, dot-blot analysis showed approximately 5-10% of C5 and C9 formation, as compared to an Escherichia coli control, suggesting breakdown at the C3b level. Protease treatment of the bacteria completely abolished binding of FH. Using overlay assays and mass spectroscopic analysis, we identified the FH receptor as the streptococcal histidine triad (SHT) surface protein. The ability of binding FH to SHT was further confirmed by using recombinant SHT. This report describes the identification of the SHT as an FH-binding protein on the surface of GBS type III, revealing a novel mechanism by which the bacterium acquires FH to evade complement opsonization.
TI  - Pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  - This paper describes a new DNA chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. Probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli and related species. These groups were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene. For microarray validation, 22 strains from the American Type Culture Collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested. The results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. Moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. The universal array described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.
TI  - [Neonatal group B Streptococcus infection: an integrated approach (of clinical pathologists, gynecologists, midwives, pediatricians-neonatologists) of the functional area of Cuneo (Italy)].
AB  - The frequency of early-onset neonatal sepsis without prophylaxis is 1-5/1.000 live births. Since year '70 the most frequent causative microorganism is the group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae, GBS), followed by Escherichia coli. The mortality rate is now reduced to 4% due to the improvement of neonatal intensive care. In the USA, the incidence of GBS early-onset neonatal sepsis has been markedly reduced by the application of the guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This strategy, however, is not effective on occurrence of late-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease. In Italy, the application of CDC guidelines is not customary, and different, often complex, protocols of obstetrical-neonatological integrated approach are applied. The frequency of infectious risk has made the GBS a paramount problem for the neonatologist, even for the legal responsibility issues resulting from the multiplicity of possible options. To reach the best level of protection of the newborn against early-onset GBS infection, the working group of providers of prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care of the functional area of Cuneo issued an integrated protocol, in order to perform the GBS screening with the optimal culture method suggested by CDC guidelines in the highest possible number of pregnant women, and to standardize the obstetrical and neonatal management.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  - Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. Here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal UGLs and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. The putative genes for UGL and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. The UGLs of these three streptococci were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. Streptococcal UGLs degraded unsaturated hyaluronate and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. Distinct from Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL, streptococcal UGLs preferred sulfated substrates. DNA microarray and Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in S. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) was determined at 1.75 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. SagUGL adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to Bacillus UGL, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. SagUGL Arg-236 was found to be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal UGLs.
TI  - Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of laminin-binding protein (Lmb) from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Laminin-binding protein (Lmb), a surface-exposed lipoprotein from Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus), mediates attachment to human laminin and plays a crucial role in the adhesion/invasion of eukaryotic host cells. However, the structural basis of laminin binding still remains unclear. In the context of detailed structural analysis, the lmb gene has been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.5 A and belonged to the monoclinic space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 56.63, b = 70.60, c = 75.37 A, beta = 96.77 degrees .
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time PCR.
AB  - We aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000). In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.
TI  - Characterization and bacterial response of zinc oxide particles prepared by a biomineralization process.
AB  - In this paper, olive-like ZnO particles were successfully synthesized via a facile biomineralization process in the template of silk fibroin (SF) peptide at room temperature. The coat of SF peptide on the surface of ZnO particles had a substantial influence on their morphology during the biomineralization. Room-temperature photoluminescence behavior of ZnO particles indicated that the visible blue emission peak centered at 410 nm was enhanced with the mineralization time. Bacteriological tests revealed that the mineralized ZnO particles with SF peptide were not toxic for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae, presenting good cytocompatibility due to the surface coat of peptide. Their potential applications in bio-optical detectors could be envisioned.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials on major bacterial mastitis  pathogens in vitro.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials including trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC), eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol on major bacterial mastitis pathogens in milk. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the aforementioned compounds on Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli were determined. In addition, the bactericidal kinetics of TC on the aforementioned pathogens and the persistence of the antimicrobial activity of TC in milk over a period of 2 wk were investigated. All 4 plant-derived molecules exhibited antimicrobial activity against the 5 mastitis pathogens tested, but TC was most effective in killing the bacteria. The MIC and MBC of TC on Staph. aureus, E. coli, and Strep. uberis were 0.1 and 0.45%, respectively, whereas that on Strep. agalactiae and Strep. dysgalactiae were 0.05 and 0.4%, respectively. The MIC and MBC of the other 3 molecules ranged from 0.4 to 0.8% and 0.8 to 1.5%, respectively. In time-kill assays, TC at the MBC reduced the bacterial pathogens in milk by 4.0 to 5.0 log(10) cfu/mL and to undetectable levels within 12 and 24 h, respectively. The antimicrobial effect of TC persisted for the duration of the experiment (14 d) without any loss of activity. Results of this study suggest that TC has the potential to be evaluated as an alternative or adjunct to antibiotics as intramammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.
TI  - In silico prioritisation of candidate genes for prokaryotic gene function discovery: an application of phylogenetic profiles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In silico candidate gene prioritisation (CGP) aids the discovery of gene functions by ranking genes according to an objective relevance score. While several CGP methods have been described for identifying human disease genes, corresponding methods for prokaryotic gene function discovery are lacking. Here we present two prokaryotic CGP methods, based on phylogenetic profiles, to assist with this task. RESULTS: Using gene occurrence patterns in sample genomes, we developed two CGP methods (statistical and inductive CGP) to assist with the discovery of bacterial gene functions. Statistical CGP exploits the differences in gene frequency against phenotypic groups, while inductive CGP applies supervised machine learning to identify gene occurrence pattern across genomes. Three rediscovery experiments were designed to evaluate the CGP frameworks. The first experiment attempted to rediscover peptidoglycan genes with 417 published genome sequences. Both CGP methods achieved best areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.911 in Escherichia coli K-12 (EC-K12) and 0.978 Streptococcus agalactiae 2603 (SA-2603) genomes, with an average improvement in precision of >3.2-fold and a maximum of >27-fold using statistical CGP. A median AUC of >0.95 could still be achieved with as few as 10 genome examples in each group of genome examples in the rediscovery of the peptidoglycan metabolism genes. In the second experiment, a maximum of 109-fold improvement in precision was achieved in the rediscovery of anaerobic fermentation genes in EC-K12. The last experiment attempted to rediscover genes from 31 metabolic pathways in SA-2603, where 14 pathways achieved AUC >0.9 and 28 pathways achieved AUC >0.8 with the best inductive CGP algorithms. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the two CGP methods can assist with the study of functionally uncategorised genomic regions and discovery of bacterial gene-function relationships. Our rediscovery experiments also provide a set of standard tasks against which future methods may be compared.
TI  - Phagocytosis and postphagocytic reaction of cord blood and adult blood monocyte after infection with green fluorescent protein-labeled Escherichia coli and group B Streptococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response induced by immune cells (monocytes). We investigated the initial stage of monocyte-pathogen interaction, i.e. bacterial ingestion and degradation at the single-cell level, by comparing a new flow cytometric procedure with culture methods. We also examined the hypothesis that, in terms of phagocytosis-induced cell death (PICD), phenotype, or cytokine production, cord blood monocytes (CBMO) differ from monocytes derived from adults (peripheral blood monocytes, PBMO). METHODS: Phagocytosis and intracellular degradation were assessed by means of flow cytometry and bacterial cultures of green fluorescent protein-labeled group B Streptococci (GBS) and Escherichia coli. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured through luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Apoptosis, phenotype, and cytokine production were assessed through flow cytometry. RESULTS: Flow cytometry and bacterial cultures showed no difference between phagocytosis and degradation of GBS and E. coli by PBMO and CBMO. A high correlation between both methods was observed. No difference in ROS production was evident. In comparison with PBMO, CBMO apoptosis was lower after exposure to GBS and E. coli. Similarities were found between nonapoptotic monocytes and pro-inflammatory monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: PICD is lower in CBMO during the early stages of monocyte-pathogen interaction. Our results emphasize that monocyte apoptosis has a potential role in tailoring the immune response in neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Early and late markers for the detection of early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this study we tested how a combination of early and late paraclinic markers could predict early onset neonatal sepsis (EONS). METHODOLOGY: The first 24 hours after the suspicion of EONS, we measured interleukine (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (INF-gamma), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 8-hour intervals on 123 neonates clinically suspected for EONS. The neonates were divided into two groups. The sepsis group: 1A with blood culture verified bacteraemia and 1B strongly suspected sepsis (29 patients). The no sepsis group: 2A treated with antibiotics (37 patients) and 2B not treated with antibiotics (57 patients). RESULTS: Combined evaluation of each of the early markers with PCT > 25 ng/ml for prediction of EONS at time 0, gave the following sensitivities and specificities: IL-6 > 250 pg/ml: 71% and 88%; IL-8 > 900 pg/ml: 50% and 88%; IL-10 > 40 pg/ml: 43% and 87%; and immature/total (I/T) ratio > 0.35: 59% and 88%. The results of IL-18, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma did not predict EONS. CONCLUSION: IL-6 combined with PCT values is a fair way to evaluate EONS at the time of suspicion of infection. The "old" early marker, I/T ratio, is almost as efficient as IL-6. By combining an early and a late marker it may be possible to reduce the diagnostic "non-conclusive" period of paraclinic values.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Eight-plex PCR and liquid-array detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected meningitis.
AB  - We here report on the development of a novel multiplex PCR with product detection in a Luminex 100 suspension array system. The assay covers the nine most important bacterial and viral pathogens found in Danish meningitis patients. The microorganisms include Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and varicella-zoster virus. The study was based on 1,187 samples, of which 55 were found to be positive by PCR. The assay was found to have an excellent sensitivity and an excellent specificity compared to the results of a "gold standard," defined by routine laboratory tests, for the two most important pathogens, S. pneumoniae (95 and 99.1%, respectively) and N. meningitidis (100 and 99.7%, respectively). The method provides a valuable supplement to the traditional microscopy and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in a routine diagnostic setting, and results can be available within 1 workday. The method is suitable for use for the initial screening and identification of nine important microorganisms in CSF samples from patients with suspected meningitis. Compared to microscopy and culture of CSF, this rapid and sensitive method will support physicians with the selection of the appropriate antimicrobial agents and the initiation of timely treatment in the absence of live microorganisms in the CSF.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Changing trends in mastitis.
AB  - The global dairy industry, the predominant pathogens causing mastitis, our understanding of mastitis pathogens and the host response to intramammary infection are changing rapidly. This paper aims to discuss changes in each of these aspects. Globalisation, energy demands, human population growth and climate change all affect the dairy industry. In many western countries, control programs for contagious mastitis have been in place for decades, resulting in a decrease in occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis and an increase in the relative impact of Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli mastitis. In some countries, Klebsiella spp. or Streptococcus dysgalactiae are appearing as important causes of mastitis. Differences between countries in legislation, veterinary and laboratory services and farmers' management practices affect the distribution and impact of mastitis pathogens. For pathogens that have traditionally been categorised as contagious, strain adaptation to human and bovine hosts has been recognised. For pathogens that are often categorised as environmental, strains causing transient and chronic infections are distinguished. The genetic basis underlying host adaptation and mechanisms of infection is being unravelled. Genomic information on pathogens and their hosts and improved knowledge of the host's innate and acquired immune responses to intramammary infections provide opportunities to expand our understanding of bovine mastitis. These developments will undoubtedly contribute to novel approaches to mastitis diagnostics and control.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of udder pathogens from cases of acute clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  - To investigate occurrence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in udder pathogens MICs in Staphylococcus aureus (n=211), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n=56), Streptococcus uberis (n=113), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (n=152), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=6), Escherichia coli (n=163), and Klebsiella spp. (n=42) were determined using microdilution. Isolates were from a nation wide survey employing strict inclusion criteria. Presence of acquired resistance was evaluated by species-specific epidemiological cut-off values issued by EUCAST. Penicillin or methicillin resistance in staphylococci were however evaluated by beta-lactamase production or presence of the mecA gene, respectively. Staphylococci were mostly susceptible to antimicrobials tested but 7.1% of S. aureus and 12.5% of CNS were resistant to penicillin by beta-lactamase production. Methicillin resistance was not found in S. aureus. All Streptococcus dysgalactiae and S. agalactiae were susceptible to penicillin. Bimodal MIC distributions for tetracycline in S dysgalactiae and S. uberis indicate acquired resistance in some isolates. Among E. coli 12.3% of isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Resistance to streptomycin (11.0%), sulphametoxazole (8.6%), ampicillin (7.4%), or tetracycline (4.9%) were the most common traits. Klebsiella spp. were resistant to ampicillin and some isolates also to tetracycline (7.1%) or sulphonamide (9.5%). The study shows that in Sweden bacteria associated with acute clinical mastitis for the most part are susceptible to antimicrobials used in therapy but resistance to penicillin in S. aureus is not uncommon. Penicillin is recommended for treatment of mastitis caused by gram-positive pathogens and regular monitoring of beta-lactamase production in S. aureus is therefore recommended in herds with udder health problems.
TI  - Lactic acid is a potential virulence factor for group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes sepsis and meningitis in neonates and infants. Although several GBS-associated virulence factors have been described, the mechanisms of GBS invasive disease are not well understood. To characterize additional virulence factors, a novel in vitro infection assay was developed using rat fetal lung explants. However, application of GBS to the system induced rapid lung tissue destruction associated with increased media acidity. Since lactic acid produced by other streptococci is an important virulence factor, we hypothesized that lactic acid contributed to the virulence of GBS. Spent growth media and neutralized-spent media were applied to explants and results indicated that neutralization of the media completely protected the tissue from degradation. These results were verified using multiple viability assays and with transformed cell lines. Furthermore, comparable spent media from Escherichia coli did not induce tissue cytotoxicity, suggesting that GBS produces organic acids in excess of other potential bacterial pathogens. Analysis of the spent media indicated that l-lactate levels reached approximately 70 mM, indicating that lactic acid is a major constituent of the metabolic acid produced by GBS. Treatment of explants with lactic acid alone produced dose-dependent tissue degradation, indicating that lactic acid is independently sufficient to induce target-tissue cytotoxicity. Finally, both spent media and 23.6 mM lactic acid produced dramatic tissue autofluorescence; the basis for this is currently unknown. These studies demonstrate that GBS-produced lactic acid is a potential virulence factor and may contribute to GBS invasive disease.
TI  - Udder shape and teat-end lesions as potential risk factors for high somatic cell  counts and intra-mammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  - The association of common bacterial pathogens in milk samples during calving with udder shape or the presence of 'teat-end' lesions was investigated in 240 dairy cows from two herds. Sixty-three of 120 cows (53%) in one herd (herd A) and 54/120 animals (45%) in a second herd (herd B) had normal-shaped udders. The remaining animals had udder shapes defined as follows: large pendulous (18% herd A, 26% herd B); large between hindquarter (10% herd A, 17% herd B); overall small (8% herd A, 5% herd B); or small but pendulous (11% herd A, 7% herd B). At calving teat-end lesions were present in 63% and 76% of the quarters of herd A and B animals, respectively. There was no herd effect on udder shape or teat-end lesions. Analysis of variance revealed that udder shape and teat-end lesions did not have a significant association with quarter somatic cell count. However there was some association between mammary infection and udder shape and teat-end lesions. Compared to other udder shapes, cows with large between hindquarter shape had significantly less Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus uberis infection (P<0.001). There was a similar albeit less significant negative association with Escherichia coli infection (P<0.01). Infection with Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae was more frequent in cows with large pendulous and overall small udder conformations. The results also suggest an association between intra-mammary infection at calving and the presence of hyperkeratotic teat-end lesions, given that S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. uberis, S. agalactiae and E. coli were cultured from significantly more quarters with such lesions than from quarters without lesions or with other types of lesion (P<0.001).
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus gordonii prophage PH15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii OMZ1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, PH15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. Phage PH15 belongs to the Siphoviridae. The complete genome sequence of PH15 was determined. The genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 ORFs. The genome of PH15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages MM1 and phiNIH1.1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. In strain OMZ1039, PH15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-tRNA gene. A plasmid, harbouring the attP site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. The phage endolysin was purified after expression in Escherichia coli and found to inhibit growth of all S. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Deaths of early-onset, invasive sepsis in full-term infants in Miyazaki: nine cases from a regional population-based analysis from 1998-2006.
AB  - In a population-based study we investigated the early-onset, invasive sepsis caused by group B streptococcus (GBS) and non-GBS in the era of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis. From 1998 to 2006, we had 387 perinatal deaths in 98,495 deliveries, and 9 full-term infants met the criteria of early-onset, invasive sepsis, in which microorganisms were proven from blood sampling. Of these cases, 4 involved GBS, 2 ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, 2 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was unidentified. All 4 cases of GBS related death underwent improper procedures contrary to the prophylaxis recommendation. Eighty percent of non-GBS related deaths had septicemia of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. We found in our population-based study that early-onset, fatal sepsis in full-term infants is associated with insufficient adherence to the prophylaxis strategy for GBS and with the emergence of antimicrobial resistant non-GBS bacteria.
TI  - Surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and contraceptive agents in recent years. In the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (MDCK) cells, human sperm cells, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. The inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of MDCK cells was also tested. A homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromides (C(n)TAB), with varying alkyl chains were shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (CMC), all of them at concentrations significantly below the CMC. In general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than C. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than MDCK cells. This suggests that the C(n)TAB may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. None of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection of MDCK cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to MDCK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.
TI  - Neonatal meningoencephalitis caused by Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The classic organisms associated with central nervous system infection in the neonate are herpes simplex, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae; we describe an unusual case of neonatal meningoencephalitis caused by Bacillus cereus.
TI  - The response of HEK293 cells transfected with bovine TLR2 to established pathogen-associated molecular patterns and to bacteria causing mastitis in cattle.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Their role in immunity is difficult to examine in species of veterinary interest, due to restricted access to the knockout technology and TLR-specific antibodies. An alternative approach is to generate cell lines transfected with various TLRs and to examine the recognition of PAMPs or relevant bacteria. In this report, we examined whether recognition of various PAMPs and mastitis-causing bacteria is achieved by transfection of recombinant bovine TLR2 (boTLR2). Therefore, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected by whole boTLR2. A clonal analysis of stably transfected cells disclosed variable recognition of several putative TLR2 agonists although expressing similar amounts of the transgene and endogenous TLR6. One clone (clone 25) reacted by copious interleukin-8 (IL-8) production to several stimulants of TLR2 such as di-palmitoylated cysteyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lysine (Pam2), a biochemical preparation of lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus, a commercial preparation of peptidoglycan from S. aureus, and heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM). TLR2-dependent induction of IL-8 release was stronger in medium containing human serum albumin than in medium containing fetal calf serum. Clone 25 cells responded to high concentrations of S. aureus and to Escherichia coli causing mastitis, but not to Streptococcus uberis and to Streptococcus agalactiae which also cause mastitis. Stimulation by S. aureus was relatively weak when compared (i) with stimulation of the same cells by HKLM and PAMPs derived from S. aureus, (ii) with a clone stably transfected with TLR4 and MD-2 and stimulated by E. coli causing mastitis, and (iii) with interferon-gamma-costimulated bovine macrophages stimulated by S. aureus and S. agalactiae. Thus, clone 25 is suitable for studying the interaction of putative TLR2 agonists with bovine TLR2-transfected cells, provides a cell to search for TLR2-specific antibodies, and is a tool for studying the interaction of TLR2 with bacteria causing disease, e.g. mastitis, in cattle.
TI  - Frequency, risk factors, and responsible pathogenic microorganisms of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is a serious problem in diabetic patients, and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in these patients is a risk factor for pyelonephritis and renal dysfunction. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between age, body mass index, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, glucosuria, glomerular filtration rate and microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with ASB. One hundred and twenty-three patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to ASB; Group I consisted of 22 patients with ASB, and Group II of 101 patients without ASB. There were no significant differences between the groups in regard to age, body mass index, creatinine clearance or microalbuminuria, while there were significant differences in HbA1c, duration of diabetes mellitus, glucosuria and pyuria (P < 0.05). The most commonly isolated microorganism was Escherichia coli. The present study identified the duration of diabetes, high HbA1c, glucosuria and pyuria as risk factors for ASB in type 2 diabetic patients.
TI  - Chronic endometritis in an Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).
AB  - A 48-yr-old female Asian elephant with a history of pododermatitis developed recurrent hematuria beginning in 2002. Transrectal ultrasonography and endoscopic examination in 2004 identified the uterus as the source of hematuria and excluded hemorrhagic cystitis. Treatment with Desloreline implants, antibiotics, and homeopathic drugs led to an improved general condition of the elephant. In July 2005, the elephant was suddenly found dead. During necropsy, the severely enlarged uterus contained about 250 L of purulent fluid, and histopathology revealed ulcerative suppurative endometritis with high numbers of Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus and Escherichia coli identified on aerobic culture. Additional findings at necropsy included: multifocal severe pododermatitis, uterine leiomyoma, and numerous large calcified areas of abdominal fat necrosis. Microbiologic culture of the pododermatitis lesion revealed the presence of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus, Staphylococcus sp., Corynebacterium sp., and Entercoccus sp.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - A retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private Greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. Through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. This study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in Greece. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "Lito" Private Obstetric/Gynecological Hospital, Athens, Greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During this period, 1632 women were examined. The mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. Three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. Of the isolates, in which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were Gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) Candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) Trichomonas vaginalis. Less usual isolates were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in Greece. Ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic Greek women included Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.
TI  - Integrin beta 1 regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through Rac expression.
AB  - Phagocytosis and subsequent phagosome maturation by professional phagocytes are essential in the clearance of infectious microbial pathogens. The molecular regulation of phagosome maturation is largely unknown. We show that integrin beta(1) plays critical roles in the phagocytosis of microbial pathogens and phagosome maturation. Macrophages lacking integrin beta(1) expression exhibit reduced phagocytosis of bacteria, including group B streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, phagosomes from macrophages lacking integrin beta(1) show lowered maturation rate, defective acquisition of lysosome membrane markers, and reduced F-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. Integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages exhibit impaired bactericidal activity. We found that the expression of the Rho family GTPases Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 was reduced in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages. Ectopic expression of Rac1, but not Cdc42, in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages restored defective phagosome maturation and F-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. Importantly, macrophages lacking Rac1/2 also exhibit defective maturation of phagosomes derived from opsonized Escherichia coli or IgG beads. Taken together, these results suggest that integrin beta(1) regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through Rac expression.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (Ply700) from Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. A prophage was isolated from a strain of Streptococcus uberis (ATCC 700407) following exposure to mitomycin C. Partial sequencing of the phage DNA revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. The putative lysin (Ply700) was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. Addition of the purified Ply700 to bacterial suspensions of S. uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, or E. coli. Killing of S. uberis in milk by Ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. Activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (P<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (P<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. In contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. Functional characterization of the C-terminal domain, as a component of a GFP fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to S. uberis. The C-terminal domain may have utility in targeting S. uberis while it remains to be determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of S. uberis mastitis.
TI  - Inactivation of bacterial pathogens in human milk by high-pressure processing.
AB  - Low-temperature, long-time (LTLT) pasteurization assures the safety of banked human milk; however, heat can destroy important nutritional biomolecules. High-pressure processing (HPP) shows promise as an alternative for pasteurization of breast milk. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of HPP for inactivation of selected bacterial pathogens in human milk. Human milk was inoculated with one of five pathogens (10(8) to 10(9) CFU/ml), while 0.1% peptone solution solutions with the same levels of each organism were used as controls. The samples were subjected to 400 MPa at 21 to 31 degrees C for 0 to 50 min or to 62.5 degrees C for 0 to 30 min (capillary tube method) to simulate LTLT pasteurization. Tryptic soy agar and selective media were used for enumeration. Traditional thermal pasteurization resulted in inactivation (> 7 log) of all pathogens within 10 min. In human milk and in peptone solution, a 6-log reduction was achieved after 30 min of HPP for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. After 30 min, S. aureus ATCC 25923 was reduced by 8 log and 6 log in human milk and peptone solution, respectively. Treatments of 4 and 7 min resulted in an 8-log inactivation of Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 12927 in human milk and peptone solution, respectively, while Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 required 2 min for an 8-log inactivation in human milk. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was inactivated by 8 log after 10 min in peptone solution and by 6 log after 30 min in human milk. These data suggest that HPP may be a promising alternative for pasteurization of human milk. Further research should evaluate the efficacy of HPP in the inactivation of relevant viral pathogens.
TI  - Reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  - The evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. Extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. In many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. It has recently been suggested that serum procalcitonin (PCT) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. This study was designed to determine the reliability of PCT concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values. The current study included 69 newborn babies. After full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: Group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. They had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. The second group: Group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified into twosubgroups: group 2A; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2B included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood culture. Blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and blood chemistry, additionally, CRP, serum IL-6 and PCT were measured. The microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2A; Escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group B streptococci (GBS) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was GBS positive mother. The comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (WBCs) and CRP levels were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. While in group 2B the WBCs not differed from group 1 but CRP differed from group 1. IL-6 and PCT values were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. Furthermore in group 2B both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. For the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, PCT give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.7%. At a cutoff >140 ng/ml, IL-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, speCificity of 70.4%, PPV of 64%, NPV of 63.3%. However, at a cutoff >12 mg/L, CRP gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, PPV of 77.1%, NPV of 70%. We conclude that the serum PCT concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.
TI  - Lincomycin resistance gene lnu(D) in Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis UCN 42, isolated from a case of bovine mastitis, was intermediately resistant to lincomycin (MIC = 2 microg/ml) while remaining susceptible to clindamycin (MIC = 0.06 microg/ml) and erythromycin. A 1.1-kb SacI fragment was cloned from S. uberis UCN 42 total DNA on plasmid pUC 18 and introduced into Escherichia coli AG100A, where it conferred resistance to both clindamycin and lincomycin. The sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of a new gene, named lnu(D), that encoded a 164-amino-acid protein with 53% identity with Lnu(C) previously reported to occur in Streptococcus agalactiae. Crude lysates of E. coli AG100A containing the cloned lnu(D) gene inactivated lincomycin and clindamycin in the presence of ATP and MgCl(2). Mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that the lnu(D) enzyme catalyzed adenylylation of clindamycin. A domain conserved in deduced sequences of lincosamide O-nucleotidyltransferases Lnu(A), Lnu(C), LinA(N2), and Lin(D) and in the aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase ANT(2'') was identified.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Tigecycline in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected in Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study (part of the global TEST program), the in vitro activity of tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the glycylcyclines, against clinical isolates collected in Italy was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 200 clinical isolates were collected and identified in our institution during 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method recommended by the CLSI in 2005. RESULTS: Globally, 135 Gram-negative and 65 Gram-positive pathogens were evaluated. Tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC(90) <or=1 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity (comparable to or greater than most commonly employed antimicrobials) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens. These data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective empiric therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Effects of complement regulators bound to Escherichia coli K1 and Group B Streptococcus on the interaction with host cells.
AB  - Escherichia coli K1 and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are the most common bacteria  that cause meningitis during the neonatal period. Complement, the first line of defence in the host, acts on these bacteria to opsonize with various components of complement for subsequent presentation to phagocytes. To counteract these opsonization effects, E. coli and GBS bind to the complement regulators C4 binding protein and Factor H, respectively. Nonetheless, the deposition of complement components on these two bacteria from neonatal serum and their effect on the host cell interaction is unclear. Here we demonstrated that the deposition of complement proteins from adult serum prevented the invasion of E. coli into human brain microvascular endothelial cells, whereas the invasion of GBS was enhanced. In contrast, treatment with cord serum had no effect on the invasion of both these bacteria. We also examined the effect of the deposited complement proteins on phagocytosis using THP-1 cells and THP-1 cells differentiated into macrophages. Escherichia coli treated with adult serum neither attached nor entered these cells, whereas GBS was phagocytosed and survived efficiently. We further demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of complement proteins is the result of the bound complement inhibitors C4b-binding protein, in the case of E. coli, and Factor H, in the case of GBS. Taken together, these results suggest that E. coli and GBS utilize contrasting mechanisms of complement-mediated interactions with their target cells for successful establishment of disease.
TI  - [Neonatal infections of the bones and joints].
AB  - Neonatal osteoarticular infections remain rare, with an estimated incidence of 1  to 3 cases per 1000 admissions to Neonatal Intensive Care Units. It usually results from bacteraemia and may thus be induced by IV catheters. More rarely it is due to direct inoculation secondary to cutaneous damage, or extension of soft tissue infection. The particularity of bone vascularization in the newborn explains the frequency of abscess formation in the periosteum or in soft tissues. The main pathogen involved is S. aureus (3/4 of cases), followed by group B streptococci and enterobacteriacae. Infection consists mainly of localised and slowly progressing abscesses. However, multifocal and severe infection is possible, in particular when caused by an IV catheter. Ultrasonography is the best initial investigation, possibly leading to surgical care. Medical treatment must include 2 synergistic antistaphyloccocal antibiotics, possibly associated with cefotaxime. The outcome is generally favorable, but orthopaedic consequences may emerge if the growth plate is involved. Rare specific causes, such as syphilis or tuberculosis, should also be evoked, but the clinical context is generally helpful for the diagnosis.
TI  - LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 prophage lysins of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Putative N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase genes from LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 prophages of Streptococcus agalactiae were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes lysed the cell walls of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptidoglycan digestion products in the cell wall lysates were not consistent with amidase activity. Instead, the structure of the muropeptide digestion fragments indicated that both the LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 lysins exhibited gamma-d-glutaminyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity. The endopeptidase cleavage specificity of the lysins was confirmed using a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to a portion of the stem peptide and cross bridge of Streptococcus agalactiae peptidoglycan. The LambdaSa2 lysin also displayed beta-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity.
TI  - Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from cord blood in-vitro are pathogen dependent and increased in comparison to adult controls.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a role in increased morbidity and mortality from neonatal sepsis. Objective of this study was to compare secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the cord blood cells of healthy term neonates to the venous blood cells of healthy adults in vitro after stimulation with common neonatal pathogens. METHOD: Blood samples were cultured in the presence of heat-killed group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi). Concentrations of secreted cytokines (interleukine-6, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha, interleukine-1 beta, IL-1beta and interleukine-8, IL-8) were measured after 0, 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation using chemiluminescent immunometric automated assay. RESULTS: Blood samples from 22 neonates and 16 adults were compared. After stimulation by GBS and E. coli, cord blood cells secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8 than blood cells of healthy adults. In cord blood, E. coli induced secretion of higher concentration of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-8 than S. epi, and more IL-6 than GBS; GBS induced more IL-1beta than S.epi. CONCLUSIONS: Response of cord blood to microbial activators is different from that of adult controls. Each isolate of heat-killed bacteria induced different amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. This may represent a useful in vitro virulence test.
TI  - NeuA sialic acid O-acetylesterase activity modulates O-acetylation of capsular polysaccharide in group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis.  A major GBS virulence determinant is its sialic acid (Sia)-capped capsular polysaccharide. Recently, we discovered the presence and genetic basis of capsular Sia O-acetylation in GBS. We now characterize a GBS Sia O-acetylesterase that modulates the degree of GBS surface O-acetylation. The GBS Sia O-acetylesterase operates cooperatively with the GBS CMP-Sia synthetase, both part of a single polypeptide encoded by the neuA gene. NeuA de-O-acetylation of free 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac(2)) was enhanced by CTP and Mg(2+), the substrate and co-factor, respectively, of the N-terminal GBS CMP-Sia synthetase domain. In contrast, the homologous bifunctional NeuA esterase from Escherichia coli K1 did not display cofactor dependence. Further analyses showed that in vitro, GBS NeuA can operate via two alternate enzymatic pathways: de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac(2) followed by CMP activation of Neu5Ac or activation of Neu5,9Ac(2) followed by de-O-acetylation of CMP-Neu5,9Ac(2). Consistent with in vitro esterase assays, genetic deletion of GBS neuA led to accumulation of intracellular O-acetylated Sias, and overexpression of GBS NeuA reduced O-acetylation of Sias on the bacterial surface. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved asparagine residue 301 abolished esterase activity but preserved CMP-Sia synthetase activity, as evidenced by hyper-O-acetylation of capsular polysaccharide Sias on GBS expressing only the N301A NeuA allele. These studies demonstrate a novel mechanism regulating the extent of capsular Sia O-acetylation in intact bacteria and provide a genetic strategy for manipulating GBS O-acetylation in order to explore the role of this modification in GBS pathogenesis and immunogenicity.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - Development of specific and rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in dairy products by PCR.
AB  - A simple and specific method for direct detection of bovine mastitis pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) in milk products, bacterial samples from milk and isolated bacterial DNA was developed. The method is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using sequence-specific primers only for GBS and species-specific primers derived from 16S and 23S rRNA for all chosen species. The presence of the gene of surface immunogenic protein (Sip) in bovine GBS isolates, described previously only in human GBS isolates was confirmed. The GBS detection was performed with the sequence coding for surface immunogenic protein from GBS human isolates designated as Sip specific sequence (SSS); this sequence was selected for specific primer design. The sequence is unique for GBS and was designed from a consensus of all known sip genes. The specific identification was shown on a collection of 75 GBS bovine isolates from different localities in Slovakia. All isolates were positive to SSS, 16S and 23S rRNA sequence. The 16S and 23S rRNA PCR detection was also performed with S. aureus and E. coli isolates and specific PCR products were also detected. The detection limit of this assay for milk products was 6 CFU/microL (i.e. 6000 CFU/mL) for GBS and E. coli, and 16 CFU/microL for S. aureus. This rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic method can be performed within hours and represents an innovative diagnostic tool for the detection of milk pathogens in dairy products.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - The effect of season on somatic cell count and the incidence of clinical mastitis.
AB  - Bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC), individual cow somatic cell count (ICSCC),  and incidence rate of clinical mastitis (IRCM) are all udder health parameters. So far, no studies have been reported on the effect of season on BMSCC, IRCM, and ICSCC in the same herds and period over multiple years. The objectives of this study were to determine the seasonal pattern over a 4-yr period of 1) BMSCC, 2) elevated ICSCC, 3) IRCM, and 4) pathogen-specific IRCM. Bulk milk somatic cell count, ICSCC, and pathogen-specific clinical mastitis data were recorded in 300 Dutch dairy farms. For the analyses of BMSCC, ICSCC, and IRCM, a mixed, a transitional, and a discrete time survival analysis model were used, respectively. Sine and cosine were included in the models to investigate seasonal patterns in the data. For all parameters, a seasonal effect was present. Bulk milk somatic cell count peaked in August to September in all 4 years. The probability of cows getting or maintaining a high ICSCC was highest in August and May, respectively. Older and late-lactation cows were more likely to develop or maintain a high ICSCC. Incidence rate of clinical mastitis was highest in December to January, except for Streptococcus uberis IRCM, which was highest in August. Totally confined herds had a higher Escherichia coli IRCM in summer than in winter. Compared with the major mastitis pathogens, the seasonal differences in IRCM were smaller for the minor pathogens. Distinguishing between Strep. uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and other streptococci is essential when identifying Streptococcus spp. because each of them has a unique epidemiology. Streptococcus uberis IRCM seemed to be associated with being on pasture, whereas E. coli IRCM was more housing-related.
TI  - Serum amyloid A: an early and accurate marker of neonatal early-onset sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute phase protein in the detection of neonatal early-onset sepsis, by means of a fast automated SAA kit. STUDY DESIGN: Full-term infants <72 h of age, who had risk factors and/or were suspected of having sepsis, were eligible for study. The levels of SAA were taken at 0, 24 and 48 h post sepsis evaluation. Thirty matched infants served as a control group for comparing SAA concentrations. RESULTS: Of 104 infants eligible for entry to the study, 23 had sepsis and 81 had not sepsis. The SAA levels of the septic group were significantly higher than those of the nonseptic group at 0, 24 and 48 h (P<0.01 for all time points). In comparison with C-reactive protein (CRP), SAA levels rose earlier and in a sharper manner, had higher levels and returned faster to normal values in infants with early onset sepsis. At 0 h post-sepsis evaluation, serum SAA had an overall better diagnostic accuracy for predicting early onset sepsis than CRP (sensitivity (96 vs 30%), specificity (95 vs 98%), positive predictive value (85 vs 78%), negative predictive value (99 vs 83%), positive likelihood ratio (19 vs 12), and negative likelihood ratio (0.05 vs 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: SSA is advocated as an inflammatory marker of neonatal early-onset sepsis.
TI  - Consequences of prophylaxis for group B streptococcal infections of the neonate.
AB  - In the 1970s, group B streptococci emerged as the leading cause of neonatal infections. The incidence ranged between 1.5 and 2 cases per 1000 in the U.S. in the 1980s up to the early 1990s. In the 1980s, selective treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics of mothers in labor turned out to be the most successful mode of prevention. In 1996, the CDC, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the use of one of two prevention strategies: the culture-based strategy or a risk-based strategy for mothers who did not have prenatal cultures. In 2002, the guidelines were updated to recommend as preferable the culture-based method, which was found to result in superior prevention compared with the risk-based method. Subsequent to the 1996 recommendations, early-onset GBS infection has been reduced by greater than 70% and racial inequalities have been narrowed. Whether exposure of millions of mothers to penicillin or ampicillin will have an undesirable effect of causing more Escherichia coli infections in neonates or will result in more ampicillin-resistant organisms being responsible for early-onset neonatal infections remains unclear.
TI  - Stochastic modeling to determine the economic effects of blanket, selective, and  no dry cow therapy.
AB  - In many countries, blanket dry cow therapy (DCT) is the standard way to dry off cows. Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance, selective DCT is proposed as an alternative. The economic consequences of different types of DCT were studied previously, but variation between input traits and different types of pathogens were not taken into account. The goal of this study was to create a stochastic Monte Carlo model to simulate the dynamics of intramammary infections (IMI) around the dry period to predict the economic consequences of DCT for different types of pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli). The traits used in the model can be varied. The probabilities within the basic situation were collected from the literature and, because not all information needed was available in the literature, by interviewing experts (n = 10). The expert opinions were translated into minimum, most expected, and maximum values for each of the different probabilities. For Dutch farmers, the costs associated with mastitis and mastitis control around the dry period varied between 10.61 euros and 26.61 euros (average 15.60 euros) for blanket DCT, between 4.86 euros and 29.41 euros (average 13.72 euros) for selective DCT, and between 4.08 euros and 42.60 euros (average 18.02 euros) for no DCT. Although there were small differences between the treatment groups, the variation within the treatment groups was much larger. The major portion of the costs for selective treatment (59% of the total costs) and no DCT (82%) was derived from the costs of clinical mastitis after calving, and for blanket DCT, the costs of treatment (65%) exceeded the costs of clinical mastitis (27%). The cost of mastitis around the dry period was most sensitive to a change in the risk of new IMI during the dry period, spontaneous cure, and costs associated with the antibiotic treatment. The optimal decision to dry off cows depends on the attitude of the farmer toward risk and other farm-specific traits and probabilities such as the new IMI rate during the dry period. Therefore, it is necessary to make farm-specific calculations so that farmers are able to factor this information into their decisions when choosing the best DCT for their situations.
TI  - [Community-acquired urinary tract infections in 15 to 65 years old female patients in France. Susceptibility of E. coli according to history: AFORCOPI-BIO network 2003].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A multicenter study was implemented in order to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of strains isolated from 15 to 65 year old female patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October to December 2003, 11 French private laboratories consecutively collected 420 clinical strains with medical data. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on E. coli were determined using the agar dilution method in a coordinating center and interpretation followed the recommendations of the Comite de l'antibiogramme de la Societe francaise de microbiologie. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (80%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (4%), Klebsiella spp (2%), other Enterobacteriaceae (4%), Enterococcus spp (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2%), and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). The susceptibility of E. coli strains was 61% for amoxicillin (AMX), 93% for nalidixic acid (NAL), 97% for norfloxacin (NOR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), 77% for cotrimoxazole (SXT), 99% for fosfomycin, gentamicin and cefotaxime. The susceptibility of E. coli was lower in case of previous treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics for AMX (84 vs 95% p=0.02) and SXT (62 vs 81% p=0.02). In the same way, previous treatment with quinolones was associated with decreased susceptibility for NAL (84 vs 95% p=0.02) and SXT (62 vs 81% p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In 2003, fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin kept a good activity on E. coli collected from community-acquired urinary tract infections in 15 to 65 years old female patients in France.
TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae GAPDH is a virulence-associated immunomodulatory protein.
AB  - Certain extracellular proteins produced by several pathogenic microorganisms interfere with the host immune system facilitating microbial colonization and were thus designated virulence-associated immunomodulatory proteins. In this study, a protein with B lymphocyte stimulatory activity was isolated from culture supernatants of Streptococcus agalactiae strain NEM316. This protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa, was identified as GAPDH by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The gapC gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli for the production of a recombinant histidyl-tagged protein. The recombinant GAPDH (rGAPDH), purified in an enzymatically active form, induced in vitro an up-regulation of CD69 expression on B cells from normal and BCR transgenic mice. In addition, rGAPDH induced an increase in the numbers of total, but not of rGAPDH-specific, splenic Ig-secreting cells in C57BL/6 mice treated i.p. with this protein. These in vitro- and in vivo-elicited B cell responses suggest that the B cell stimulatory effect of rGAPDH is independent of BCR specificity. A S. agalactiae strain overexpressing GAPDH showed increased virulence as compared with the wild-type strain in C57BL/6 mice. This virulence was markedly reduced in IL-10-deficient and anti-rGAPDH antiserum-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production, which was detected at higher concentrations in the serum of rGAPDH-treated mice, is important in determining the successfulness of the host colonization by S. agalactiae and they highlight the direct role of GAPDH in this process. Taken together, our data demonstrate that S. agalactiae GAPDH is a virulence-associated immunomodulatory protein.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Novel substrate specificity of glutathione synthesis enzymes from Streptococcus agalactiae and Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is synthesized by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS) in living organisms. Recently, bifunctional fusion protein, termed gamma-GCS-GS catalyzing both gamma-GCS and GS reactions from gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae, has been reported. We revealed that in the gamma-GCS activity, S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS had different substrate specificities from those of Escherichia coli gamma-GCS. Furthermore, S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-Glu-X(aa)-Gly, from free three amino acids. In Clostridium acetobutylicum, the genes encoding gamma-GCS and putative GS were found to be immediately adjacent by BLAST search, and had amino acid sequence homology with S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS, respectively. We confirmed that the proteins expressed from each gene showed gamma-GCS and GS activity, respectively. C. acetobutylicum GS had broad substrate specificities and synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-Glu-Cys-X(aa). Whereas the substrate specificities of gamma-GCS domain protein and GS domain protein of S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS were the same as those of S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS.
TI  - Multiple interactions of FbsA, a surface protein from Streptococcus agalactiae, with fibrinogen: affinity, stoichiometry, and structural characterization.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is an etiological agent of several infective diseases in humans. We previously demonstrated that FbsA, a fibrinogen-binding protein expressed by this bacterium, elicits a fibrinogen-dependent aggregation of platelets. In the present communication, we show that the binding of FbsA to fibrinogen is specific and saturable, and that the FbsA-binding site resides in the D region of fibrinogen. In accordance with the repetitive nature of the protein, we found that FbsA contains multiple binding sites for fibrinogen. By using several biophysical methods, we provide evidence that the addition of FbsA induces extensive fibrinogen aggregation and has noticeable effects on thrombin-catalyzed fibrin clot formation. Fibrinogen aggregation was also found to depend on FbsA concentration and on the number of FbsA repeat units. Scanning electron microscopy evidentiated that, while fibrin clot is made of a fine fibrillar network, FbsA-induced Fbg aggregates consist of thicker fibers organized in a cage-like structure. The structural difference of the two structures was further indicated by the diverse immunological reactivity and capability to bind tissue-type plasminogen activator or plasminogen. The mechanisms of FbsA-induced fibrinogen aggregation and fibrin polymerization followed distinct pathways since Fbg assembly was not inhibited by GPRP, a specific inhibitor of fibrin polymerization. This finding was supported by the different sensitivity of the aggregates to the disruptive effects of urea and guanidine hydrochloride. We suggest that FbsA and fibrinogen play complementary roles in contributing to thrombogenesis associated with S. agalactiae infection.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Identification and sequence of a tet(M) tetracycline resistance determinant homologue in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The presence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(M) in human clinical  isolates of Escherichia coli is described for the first time in this report. The homologue was >99% identical to the tet(M) genes reported to occur in Lactobacillus plantarum, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae, and 3% of the residues in its deduced amino acid sequence diverge from tet(M) of Staphylococcus aureus. Sequence analysis of the regions immediately flanking the gene revealed that sequences upstream of tet(M) in E. coli have homology to Tn916; however, a complete IS26 insertion element was present immediately upstream of the promoter element. Downstream from the termination codon is an insertion sequence that was homologous to the ISVs1 element reported to occur in a plasmid from Vibrio salmonicida that has been associated with another tetracycline resistance determinant, tet(E). Results of mating experiments demonstrated that the E. coli tet(M) gene was on a mobile element so that resistance to tetracycline and minocycline could be transferred to a susceptible strain by conjugation. Expression of the cloned tet(M) gene, under the control of its own promoter, provided tetracycline and minocycline resistance to the E. coli host.
TI  - Serum concentrations of interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in neonatal sepsis and meningitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether serum levels of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP) are useful in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis and meningitis and differentiate them. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 35 full term neonates with suspected infection who admitted to the Neonatology Unit, Pediatric Department, King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia during January 2002 - June 2003. On the basis of laboratory and bacteriological results, newborns were classified into: sepsis (n = 28), meningitis (n = 7), and healthy controls (n = 16). Sepsis groups were further subdivided according to culture results into: group 1 = proven sepsis (n = 6), group 2 = clinical sepsis (n = 14), and group 3 = possible-infected (n = 8). Serum levels of IL-1alpha, IL-6, TNF-alpha were measured using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay while CRP by nephelometer. RESULTS: In sepsis and meningitis patients, serum levels of CRP (p < 0.01, p < 0.05,) and IL-1alpha (p < 0.001, p < 0.05) were elevated than controls. C-reactive protein levels elevated in proven sepsis (p < 0.001) and IL-1alpha elevated in all subgroups of sepsis (groups 1, 2, 3) compared with (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p < 0.01) controls. Interleukin-6, TNF-alpha showed no significant differences between studied groups. In sepsis and meningitis, IL-1alpha had a highest sensitivity (89%, 86%), and negative predictive values (89% and 93%). CONCLUSION: Interleukin-1alpha and CRP increased in neonatal sepsis and meningitis, but cannot differentiate between them. Interleukin-1alpha had a highest sensitivity in prediction of neonatal infection and its assessment may improve accuracy of diagnosis.
TI  - Early-onset neonatal sepsis in the era of widespread intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - C-terminal WxL domain mediates cell wall binding in Enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Analysis of the genome sequence of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate V583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. Twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved C-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated WxL. Proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the WxL region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. This hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the C-terminal regions of two WxL proteins in E. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. We demonstrated that the C-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the reporter fusions in E. faecalis. This localization was eliminated by introducing specific deletions into the domains. Interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. We also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for WxL domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. Based on our findings, we propose that the WxL region is a novel cell wall binding domain in E. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - DNA methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  - Recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (Tn1207.3 and Phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]). The dissemination of elements belonging to the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of GAS, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae recovered in Portugal was surveyed. In total, 149 GAS, 18 S. pneumoniae, 4 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 S. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the M phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 by PCR targeting open reading frames (ORFs) specific for these related elements. All the GAS isolates tested and one of the S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried Tn1207.3. However, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. It was also noted that the DNAs of the isolates carrying Tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease SmaI. Cloning and expression of ORF12 of Tn1207.3 in Escherichia coli showed that it encoded a methyltransferase that rendered DNA refractory to cleavage by SmaI (M.Spy10394I). Using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible GAS isolates presenting the M phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.
TI  - Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  - In most organisms, glutathione (GSH) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and GSH synthetase (GS). In Streptococcus agalactiae, GSH synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-GCS-GS). The N-terminal sequence of gamma-GCS-GS is similar to Escherichia coli gamma-GCS, but the C-terminal sequence is an ATP-grasp domain more similar to d-Ala, d-Ala ligase than to any known GS. In the present studies, C-terminally and N-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-GCS and GS domains, respectively. Although WT gamma-GCS-GS is nearly uninhibited by GSH (K(i) approximately 140 mM), shorter gamma-GCS domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (K(i) approximately 15 mM), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-GCS enzymes. Because studies with E. coli gamma-GCS implicate a flexible loop region in GSH binding, chimeras of S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS were made containing gamma-GCS domain flexible loop sequences from Enterococcus faecalis and Pasteurella multocida gamma-GCS-GS, isoforms that are inhibited by GSH. Inhibition remained S. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). C-Terminal constructs of gamma-GCS-GS have GS activity (0.01-0.04% of WT), but proper folding and significant GS activity required a covalently linked gamma-GCS domain. In addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-GCS-GS sequence established that GS activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-GCS domain. Our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-GCS-GS and suggest gamma-GCS-GS evolved from a monomeric gamma-GCS that became C-terminally fused to a multimeric ATP-grasp protein.
TI  - Transport of multidrug resistance substrates by the Streptococcus agalactiae hemolysin transporter.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]) causes neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, as well as infections of the bovine udder. The S. agalactiae hemolysin is regarded as an important virulence factor, and hemolysin expression is dependent on the cyl gene cluster. cylA and cylB encode the ATP binding and transmembrane domains of a typical ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The deduced proteins contain the signature sequence of a multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter, and mutation of the genes results in a nonhemolytic and nonpigmented phenotype. To further elucidate the function of the putative transporter, nonpolar deletion mutants of cylA were constructed. These mutants are nonhemolytic and can be complemented by the transporter genes. Wild-type strain and nonhemolytic cylA and cylK deletion mutants were exposed to known substrates of MDR transporters. Mutation of cylA significantly impaired growth in the presence of daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and rhodamine 6G and resulted in a decreased export of doxorubicin from the cells. The mutation of cylK, a gene of unknown function located downstream from cylA, caused a loss of hemolysis but had no effect on the transport of MDR substrates. Furthermore, the hemolytic activity of the wild-type strain was inhibited by reserpine in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that CylAB closely resembles an ABC-type MDR transporter and propose that the GBS hemolysin molecule represents a natural substrate of the transporter.
TI  - Potential pathogens carried by Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern Spain.
AB  - The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern Spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. We sampled 321 ibex (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with Sarcoptes scabiei. A total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 Mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with S. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. Infections with Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. With Escherichia coli, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida biotype A, and Staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher isolation rates were associated with adults. The isolation frequency for E. coli was higher in females, whereas Moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated with males. The presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and M. haemolytica. The geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of Branhamella ovis, M. agalactiae, and all Pasteurella sp. Isolations of M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, E. coli, and B. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging rather than captive animals. Of the gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. arginini were the predominant Mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. The most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria included E. coli, M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, and B. ovis. Isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. In nasal samples, M. haemolytica and P. multocida biotype A were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, B. ovis and E. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.
TI  - Influence of probiotic vaginal lactobacilli on in vitro adhesion of urogenital pathogens to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli, the predominant micro-organisms of the vaginal microbiota, play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract by preventing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of four vaginal Lactobacillus strains, previously selected for their probiotic features, to block in vitro the adherence of three human urogenital pathogens to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Three types of assays were performed in order to determine the inhibitory effect of lactobacilli on adhesion of urogenital pathogens to VEC: blockage by exclusion (lactobacilli and VEC followed by pathogens), competition (lactobacilli, VEC and pathogens together) and displacement (pathogens and VEC followed by the addition of lactobacilli). Bacterial adhesion to VEC was quantified by microscopy (x1000) after Gram's stain. All the strains were able to inhibit by exclusion and competition the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to VEC but none was able to decrease the attachment of Escherichia coli by neither of the mechanisms assayed. Only Lactobacillus acidophillus CRL 1259 and Lactobacillus paracasei CRL 1289 inhibited the attachment of Group B streptococci (GBS) to VEC by exclusion and competition respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus of vaginal origin were able to inhibit the attachment of genitouropathogenic Staph. aureus and GBS to the vaginal epithelium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results support the probiotic potential of these Lactobacillus strains as anti-infective agents in the vagina and encourage further studies about their capacity to prevent and manage urogenital tract infections in females.
TI  - [Epidemiology and etiology of urinary tract infections in the community. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the main pathogens and clinical significance of resistance].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a frequent problem in primary care. They occur mainly in women without underlying diseases and with no functional or structural anomalies of the urinary tract; consequently most cases are considered uncomplicated UTI. Etiology is influenced by factors such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, urinary catheterization, and other factors. Escherichia coli causes 80-85% of acute episodes of uncomplicated cystitis. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella spp. are responsible for most of the remaining episodes. The spectrum of bacteria that causes complicated UTI is much broader. Rates of resistance have undergone considerable variations, and consequently the empirical treatment of UTI requires constant updating of the antibiotic sensitivity of the main uropathogens of the area, country or institution. To correctly interpret the global data on sensitivity, the type of UTI (uncomplicated versus complicated), sex, age and previous antibiotic therapy in each patient must be taken into account. Resistance in uncomplicated UTI has clinical significance (although less than in systemic infections such as bacteremia), which depends on whether the infection is cystitis or pyelonephritis.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with UV detection.
AB  - We suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the pH gradient 3-10. The method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol), PEG 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. In order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. For the tracing of the pH gradients the low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column UV detection at 280 nm.
TI  - Functional expression of streptococcal galactosyltransferase in baculovirus/insect cell expression system.
AB  - The cpsIaJ gene of Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia codes for beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase. In this study, the functional expression of His-tagged CpsIaJ in a baculovirus expression system was performed, because the efficient functional expression of this enzyme in Escherichia coli had been unsuccessful. Using a partially purified enzyme preparation, we found that the enzyme had a restricted substrate specificity and that the entire structure of the substrate GlcNAc beta1-3Gal beta1-4Glc was required for the activity. Furthermore, mutations in a conserved DXD motif caused the loss of the enzyme's activity.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - [Trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan (2003-2004)].
AB  - We surveyed the epidemiology of pediatric bacterial meningitis between January 2003 and December 2004 in Japan, with the following results: Bacterial meningitis cases numbered 233 (132 boys, 98 girls, and 3 unidentified), equivalent to 1.13-1.6 children of 1000 hospitalized in pediatrics per year. The age distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age, decreasing with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. The relationship between causactive pathogens and age distribution was as follows: group B. streptococcus and E. coli were major pathogens below 4 months of age and H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were major pathogens above 4 months of age. Susceptibility tests at each facility demonstrated that 65.0% of H. influenzae isolates and 83.0% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 2004 were drug-resistant. Ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are currently effective against GBS, E. coli and Listeria so a combination of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics is used first line at many facilities for patients below 4 months of age. A combination of carbapenem which showed effective against PRSP and cephem which showed effective against H. influenzae is the first choice in childhood bacterial meningitis for patients above 4 months of age.
TI  - A retrospective study of the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania.
AB  - A 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania over the period November 1971-December 2002. Laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. Eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and Escherichia coli (14.1%). Other isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and Streptococcus uberis (4.2%). Contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were Candida species. The results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical Candida albicans mastitis. The prevalence of Candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in November 2002. Conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae remain above 10%. The possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.
TI  - The TraA relaxase autoregulates the putative type IV secretion-like system encoded by the broad-host-range Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pIP501.
AB  - The conjugative multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid pIP501 can be transferred  and stably maintained in a variety of Gram-positive genera, including multicellular Streptomyces lividans, as well as in Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The 15 putative pIP501 transfer (tra) genes are organized in an operon-like structure terminating in a strong transcriptional terminator. This paper reports co-transcription of the pIP501 tra genes in exponentially growing Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 cells, as shown by RT-PCR. The tra genes are expressed throughout the life cycle of Ent. faecalis, and the expression level is independent of the growth phase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the TraA relaxase, the first gene of the tra operon, binds to the tra promoter P(tra), which partially overlaps with the origin of transfer (oriT). DNase I footprinting experiments further delimited the TraA binding region and defined the nucleotides bound by TraA. Beta-Galactosidase assays with P(tra)-lacZ fusions proved P(tra) promoter activity, which was strongly repressed when TraA was supplied in trans. Thus, it is concluded that the pIP501 tra operon is negatively autoregulated at the transcriptional level by the conjugative DNA relaxase TraA.
TI  - Evaluation of a new chromogenic medium for isolation and identification of common urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - In the study presented here, a new chromogenic medium (CPS ID 3; bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was compared to routine media for the isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria recovered from urine specimens, and a cost analysis was performed. Escherichia coli, Proteeae tribe, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus agalactiae grew on the chromogenic medium as typical differentiated colonies and were accurately identified even in mixed cultures. Although the similarity of colors produced by isolates belonging to the Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter (KESC) group prevents differentiation among them, members of KESC were easily identified as coliforms. No substantial difference was observed when comparing the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on colonies selected from reference media versus CPS ID 3. Use of the new medium was associated with a savings of 75% over the conventional methods and the API system. Furthermore, this medium facilitated a remarkable reduction in the laboratory workload and consequently resulted in additional time and cost savings.
TI  - The group B streptococcal sialic acid O-acetyltransferase is encoded by neuD, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  - Nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (Sia), and several Sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. Some pathogens are also known to O-acetylate their Sias, although the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. We report that neuD, a gene located within the Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a Sia O-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (CPS) sialylation. Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified Lys-123 as a critical residue for Sia O-acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neuD can determine whether GBS displays a "high" or "low" Sia O-acetylation phenotype. Complementation analysis revealed that Escherichia coli K1 NeuD also functions as a Sia O-acetyltransferase in GBS. In fact, NeuD homologs are commonly found within Sia biosynthetic gene clusters. A bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a Sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neuD. Included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio parahemeolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for Sia expression. Phylogenetic analysis shows that NeuD homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-Sia O-acetyltransferase of E. coli K1. These studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of GBS Sia O-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.
TI  - Characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (GshF) of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ECL) and glutathione synthetase (GS) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ECL is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas GS enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain ATP-grasp fold. This generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the Pasteurellaceae member Haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain Gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed GshF), as has been reported recently for the Gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. Here, we show that yet another member of the Pasteurellaceae family, Pasteurella multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and GshF-driven biosynthesis. Domain architecture analysis shows that this P. multocida GshF bifunctional ligase contains an N-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ECL-like domain followed by a typical ATP-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known GS ligases. Recombinant P. multocida GshF overexpresses as an approximately 85-kDa protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. The gamma-ECL activity of GshF is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (K(i) = 13.6 mM). Furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of GshF proteins.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1999 and 2003].
AB  - We evaluated 83 children with bacterial meningitis in 67 of 81 insitutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1999 and 2003 by questionnaire. The incidence of bacterial meningitis in children aged < 5 years and 5 < or =, < 10 years was 6.3 and 0.7 cases per 100, 000 children/year. The incidences of meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae in children aged < 5 years were 3.7, 1.4 and 0.8. Median age was 13 months ranging from 0 day to 9 years. Seventy-four (89.1%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 39 (47.0%) less than 1 year old. Major causative organisms were H. influenzae in 51 patients, S. pneumoniae in 18, S. agalactiae in 9 and E. coli in 3. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case mortality rate of 4.8%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 25.3%, predominantly epilepsy, hearing loss, and developmental delay of varying severity. The frequency of poor prognosis was 55.6% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae compared with 21.6% for H. influenzae and 22.2% for S. agalactiae.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - [Resistance of mastitis pathogens in northern Germany].
AB  - The data of 1692 susceptibility tests acquired from April 2003 through March 2004 in the mastitis laboratory of the Institute for Food Quality and Safety were summarized in order to help veterinarians confronted with acute mastitis in choosing the appropriate antibiotic. Two thirds of the milk samples were infected with gram-positive cocci. One third of these were identified as Streptococcus (S.) uberis, one fourth as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. All isolates (100%) of S. uberis, S. dysgalactiae, S. agalactiae and Arcanobacterium pyogenes were susceptible to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Concering S. aureus, nearly 100% of the isolates were susceptible to Oxacillin, Cephalothin, Cefacetril, Cefquinom and Neomycin, but only 88% of the isolates were sensitive to Penicillin, Ampicillin and Cefoperazon. The gram-negative rods (Escherichia (E.) coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) displayed an irregular resistance pattern. More than 93% of all examined isolates including Pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to Colistin. The sensitivity of E. coli and Klebsiella spp.to Marbofloxacin, Enrofloxacin and Cefquinom exceeded 96%. Thus, the susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens to common antibiotics is favourable. Because the highly effective Colistin is no longer approved for local therapy, the situation for gram-negative bacteria is more difficult.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of caprylic acid and monocaprylin on major bacterial mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is the most significant economic drain on the worldwide dairy industry. Concerns regarding poor cure rates, emergence of bacterial resistance, and residues in milk necessitate development of alternative therapeutic approaches to antibiotics for treatment of mastitis. A variety of free fatty acids and their monoglycerides have been reported to exert antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. The objective of our study was to examine the efficacy of caprylic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, and its monoglyceride, monocaprylin, to inactivate common mastitis pathogens, including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Milk samples containing 50 mM or 100 mM caprylic acid, and 25 mM or 50 mM monocaprylin were inoculated separately with a 3-isolate mixture of each of the 5 pathogens, and incubated at 39 degrees C. Populations of surviving bacteria were determined at 0 min, 1 min, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of incubation. Both caprylic acid and monocaprylin reduced all 5 pathogens by >5.0 log cfu/mL after 6 h of incubation. Among the bacterial species tested, Strep. agalactiae, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. uberis were most sensitive, and E. coli was most tolerant to caprylic acid and monocaprylin. Results of this study indicate that caprylic acid and monocaprylin should be evaluated as alternatives or adjuncts to antibiotics as intra-mammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.
TI  - [Bacterial flora and mycosis of the vagina in women with symptoms of vaginal inflammation].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the microbiological profile of vaginal flora in 30 women  with gynecologic problems and 20 pregnant women complaining about pathological symptoms {pruritus, burning, vaginal discharge}. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The discharge from posterior vaginal vault was examined microbiologically on the Columbia Agar with sheep blood, MacConkey and Sabourand cultures incubated of 48 hours in the temperature of 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bacterial infections were detected in 33 cases (66%), 12 of these women (24%) lived in urban, 21 (42%) in rural environment. From bacteria isolated from the vagina, most often because at 14 women stepped out Streptococcus agalactiae, at 11 Enterococcus faecalis at 8 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases bacterial inflammation was caused by two kinds of bacterium. At two women stepped out both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. In single cases it was Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. In all cases of inflammation mycosis was called out by from Candida albicans. One ascertained it at 14 among all given an examination women. Mixed inflammations called out both by mycosis and bacterial stepped out in 3 cases in age of 21-30. At two women it was Candida albicans and Streptococcus agalactiae, at one inflammation mycosis accompanied Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The common reason of vaginitis are bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, E coli. Both, place of living and women' s age influence the type of etiological factor.
TI  - Trends in the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of group B streptococcal prevention.
AB  - AIM: To assess trends in the epidemiology of culture-proven and clinical neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. METHODS: Since 1995, the neonatal services of 28 acute-care teaching hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo") have been involved in the prospective surveillance of neonatal infection of vertical transmission. We here report the comparison of the incidence for the periods 1996-1997 and 2000-2001, and look separately at two groups of hospitals according to the time at which the official hospital policy to provide intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B Streptococcus (GBS) prevention was adopted. In 16 hospitals the policy was adopted in 1999 and in 10 before 1998 (nine hospitals in 1996, one in 1997). RESULTS: The incidence of proven sepsis decreased significantly by 22% and 54% in the hospitals that started prophylaxis in 1999 and before 1998, respectively. The incidence of GBS sepsis also declined significantly by 36.4% and 65.4% in both groups of hospitals, respectively. Significant variations in the incidence of clinical vertical sepsis as well as in the incidence of sepsis caused by Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella were not found. Sepsis caused by Escherichia coli increased in the hospitals with prophylaxis from 1999 and decreased in those that began prophylaxis before 1998, in which the mortality rate of proven and clinical sepsis also decreased significantly by 58.6%. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial decline in the incidence of proven vertical sepsis, with a significant reduction of GBS sepsis, although decreases were more marked when antibiotic prophylaxis was started before 1998. In this group of hospitals, there was also a decrease in the mortality rate. Fluctuations in the incidence of E. coli infection suggest the need for continuing epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Characterization of Weissella kimchii PL9023 as a potential probiotic for women.
AB  - From more than 100 lactic acid bacteria, Weissella kimchii PL9023 was selected as producing the most hydrogen peroxide and was characterized as a probiotic for women. W. kimchii PL9023 inhibited the growth and adherence of vaginal isolates of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The surface components involved in adherence of W. kimchii PL9023 to vaginal epithelial cells appeared to be glycoproteins, as determined by susceptibility to proteinase K, heat, or periodate. W. kimchii PL9023 did not produce harmful metabolites or enzymes. The results of this study suggest that W. kimchii PL9023 is a potential probiotic for vaginal health.
TI  - Concentration of ascorbic acid in the blood of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - The aim of the investigations was evaluation of ascorbic acia concentration in the blood or cows in the subclinical form of mastitis. The research was conducted on 56 cows. The cows were divided into 4 groups: A, B, and C with subclinical form of mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia col, and D control. The ascorbic acid concentration in the serum of cows was measured by the hydrazine method. We observed a marked decrease in ascorbic acid concentration in the serum of cows from experimental groups A, B and C, respectively: 34.2, 35.9, and 39.4 micromol/dm3 when we compared them with control group D--69.8 micromol/dm3. In cows with subclinical form of inflammation of the mammary gland, a decreased potential of antioxidant protection in the blood was noticed, which manifested itself as a lower ascorbic acid concentration.
TI  - New lnu(C) gene conferring resistance to lincomycin by nucleotidylation in Streptococcus agalactiae UCN36.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae UCN36 was resistant to lincomycin (MIC = 16 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (MIC = 0.12 microg/ml) and erythromycin (MIC = 0.06 microg/ml). A 4-kb HindIII fragment was cloned from S. agalactiae UCN36 total DNA on plasmid pUC18 and introduced into Escherichia coli AG100A, where it conferred resistance to lincomycin. The sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of a 1,724-bp element delineated by imperfect inverted repeats (22 of 25 bp) and inserted in the operon for capsular synthesis of S. agalactiae UCN36. This element carried two open reading frames (ORF). The deduced amino acid sequence of the upstream ORF displayed similarity with transposases from anaerobes and IS1. The downstream ORF, lnu(C), encoded a 164-amino-acid protein with 26% to 27% identity with the LnuA(N2), LnuA, and LnuA' lincosamide nucleotidyltransferases reported for Bacteroides and Staphylococcus, respectively. Crude lysates of E. coli AG100A containing the cloned lnu(C) gene inactivated lincomycin and clindamycin in the presence of ATP and MgCl2. Mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that the LnuC enzyme catalyzed adenylylation of lincomycin.
TI  - Comparison of early-onset neonatal sepsis caused by Escherichia coli and group B  Streptococcus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare maternal characteristics and  neonatal morbidity and mortality rates that are associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis that is caused by group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of newborn infants with a positive blood culture (and/or cerebrospinal fluid) that was positive for either E coli or group B Streptococcus during the first week of life. Data were abstracted from maternal and neonatal medical records. RESULTS: Among 28,659 deliveries during the study period, 102 episodes of early-onset neonatal sepsis were identified, 61 of which were caused by group B Streptococcus and 41 of which were caused by E coli. E coli sepsis cases had a lower birth weight, a higher percentage with 5-minute Apgar score <7, and a longer stay in the hospital neonatal intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation more frequently. Death after early-onset neonatal sepsis with E coli was also more frequent. CONCLUSION: Early-onset sepsis with E coli is associated with more morbidity and a higher mortality rate compared with early-onset group B Streptococcus.
TI  - Early onset neonatal meningitis in Australia and New Zealand, 1992-2002.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the epidemiology of early onset neonatal bacterial meningitis (EONBM) in Australasia. DESIGN: Prospective surveillance study, 1992-2002, in 20 neonatal units in Australia and New Zealand. EONBM was defined as meningitis occurring within 48 hours of delivery. RESULTS: There were 852 babies with early onset sepsis, of whom 78 (9.2%) had EONBM. The incidence of early onset group B streptococcal meningitis fell significantly from a peak of 0.24/1000 live births in 1993 to 0.03/1000 in 2002 (p trend = 0.002). There was no significant change over time in the incidence of Escherichia coli meningitis. The rate of EONBM in very low birthweight babies was 1.09/1000 compared with the rate in all infants of 0.11/1000. The overall rate of EONBM was 0.41/1000 in 1992 and 0.06 in 2001, but this trend was not significant (p trend = 0.07). Case-fatality rates for EONBM did not change significantly with time. Birth weight <1500 g (odds ratio (OR) 7.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8 to 10.9)) and Gram negative bacillary meningitis (OR 3.3 (95% CI 2.2 to 4.9)) were significant risk factors for mortality. Sixty two percent of the 129 babies who died from early onset sepsis or suspected sepsis did not have a lumbar puncture performed. CONCLUSION: The incidence of early onset group B streptococcal meningitis has fallen, probably because of maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, without a corresponding change in E. coli meningitis. Gram negative bacillary meningitis still carries a worse prognosis than meningitis with a Gram positive organism.
TI  - Bacterial infections--the cause of preterm delivery.
AB  - Within diagnostic procedures protocols in preterm delivery, the objective of the  study was to examine bacterial causes of preterm deliveries in relation to term deliveries. The study included 106 patients delivered before term (24 to 37 weeks of gestation) and 126 patients with term delivery after 37 to 42 weeks of gestation. Bacterial analysis included hospital material: cervix smear in patients before the delivery and protective and functional fetal elements.
TI  - Rapid detection of group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli in amniotic fluid using real-time fluorescent PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish reliability and validity of real-time fluorescent PCR for early detection of bacterial invasion of the amniotic cavity. METHODS: Amniotic fluid samples from 40 patients undergoing mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees C and were cultured on media specific for group B streptococcus (GBS) and E. coli. Concurrently, samples were analyzed with real-time fluorescent PCR (Roche LightCycler) using DNA primers and probes designed to detect the CAMP factor encoding cfb gene and uidA gene of GBS and E. coli, respectively. For positive control and to simulate amniotic fluid colonization, 104 cfu/ml of GBS and E. coli were inoculated on sterile amniotic fluid and incubated for 6 h. Bacterial genomic DNA for the two organisms was extracted and purified via the two-step precipitation method using a commercial kit. The real-time PCR assays were also tested against 25 non-GBS and non-E. coli bacterial species. The lower limit of detection for each pathogen was established using serial dilution of bacterial genomic DNA. RESULTS: All patient samples were negative for evidence of GBS and E. coli with both culture and real-time PCR methods. Amniotic fluid samples inoculated with GBS and E. coli were positive with real-time PCR whereas the 25 bacterial species other than GBS or E. coli tested negative with the assay. Average total sample processing time including the pre-enrichment step was 7 h 40 min. The average cost for DNA extraction and PCR testing was 8.50 dollars per test. CONCLUSION: Real-time fluorescent PCR is a valid and reliable method for detection of specific pathogens in amniotic fluid. This technique is sensitive for low inoculation levels. Real-time fluorescent PCR has potential to impact clinical management as a rapid, reliable detection method for GBS and E. coli in chorioamnionitis.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis and non-group B streptococcal neonatal sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of increased use of intravenous penicillin for group B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS) antibiotic prophylaxis on non-GBS neonatal sepsis and antibiotic resistance. METHODS: We undertook a nonconcurrent cohort study. Microbiology cultures originating from infants with early-onset neonatal sepsis in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from 1992 to 1999 were reviewed. Prevalence of non-GBS neonatal sepsis in the control period (January 1, 1992, through June 30, 1995) was compared with that in the study period (October 1, 1995, through August 31, 1999), when the protocol changed. Chi-squared or Fisher exact tests were used to determine statistical significance. Resistance patterns were compared in similar fashion. RESULTS: The prevalence of non-GBS neonatal sepsis was 1.2 per 1,000 (36 of 31,133) live births before and 1.1 per 1,000 (32 of 28,733) live births after institution of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention culture-based protocol (P = .97). Our power analysis assumed a doubling in the rate of non-GBS sepsis and required 21,220 live births per arm. Gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis prevalences were not significantly different. Escherichia coli and GBS resistance patterns did not change. CONCLUSION: Institution of a protocol for GBS antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreased the rate of GBS neonatal sepsis but did not increase the rate of non-GBS neonatal sepsis. Antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms were not affected.
TI  - Structural characterization of sialic acid synthase by electrospray mass spectrometry--a tetrameric enzyme composed of dimeric dimers.
AB  - Sialic acid synthase (NeuB) encoded by the neuB gene catalyzes the condensation of N-acetylmannosamine and phospho(enol)pyruvate to form N-acetylneuraminic acid. The enzyme is essential for the biosynthesis of polysialic acid, a capsular sugar polymer functioning as a virulent factor and antiphagocytic barrier. This report demonstrates the first characterization on the quaternary structure of NeuB from Escherichia coli (EcNeuB) and Streptococcus agalactiae (SaNeuB) by nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Under non-denaturing conditions, Tris buffer was observed to induce a higher ratio of tetramer/dimer of NeuB in the ESI mass spectra, providing supportive evidence for the existence of a "structurally-specific" tetramer. The instrument parameters were found to significantly affect the ratio of detected tetramer/dimer in ESI mass spectra. The harshest conditions, including high desolvation voltages and pressure in the collision cell, led to enhanced detection of the 160 kDa tetramer. The prevalence of dimeric form is likely the cause in loss of tetramer stability in gas-phase arising from insufficient collisional cooling, which implies an asymmetric assembly, possibly composed of dimeric dimers. Most interestingly, the hypothesis was further supported by chemical cross-linking of SaNeuB, in which the reaction of shorter linker yielded mainly the dimer whereas that of longer linker produced both dimer and tetramer. Furthermore, the ESI-MS analysis can reflect dramatic change of pH-dependent quaternary structure in association with enzyme activity, suggesting the tetrameric form may be the primary species responsible for the enzyme catalysis.

TI  - Use of glnQ as a counterselectable marker for creation of allelic exchange mutations in group B streptococci.
AB  - Efficient allelic exchange mutagenesis in group B streptococci (GBS) has been hampered by the lack of a counterselectable marker system. Growth inhibition of GBS by the glutamine analog gamma-glutamyl hydrazide requires glnQ. We have used this phenomenon to create a counterselectable marker system for efficient selection of allelic exchange mutants in GBS.
TI  - Influence of modified natural and synthetic surfactant preparations on bacterial  killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
AB  - In addition to its biophysical functions, surfactant plays an important role in pulmonary host defense. In this investigation we studied the influence of various commercially available surfactants on the phagocytosis of bacteria that are common pathogens in the neonatal period. Group B streptococci (GBS), Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured with isolated human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) and non-specific serum in the presence or absence of different modified natural (Curosurf, Alveofact, Survanta) or totally synthetic, protein-free surfactant preparations (Exosurf, Pumactant). Prior to and after 30 and 60 min of incubation with PMN at different surfactant concentrations (1, 10 or 20 mg/ml), the number of viable bacteria was determined by colony counting. Killing of S. aureus by PMN was not influenced by any of the surfactants. Alveofact and Curosurf had no significant negative impact on phagocytosis. At 20 mg/ml, Curosurf even reduced the number of viable E. coli. Survanta at 10 and 20 mg/ml and Exosurf at all concentrations impaired the killing of non-encapsulated GBS and E. coli. Pumactant at 1-20 mg/ml interfered with the phagocytosis of E. coli. In further experiments we demonstrated that Curosurf did not interfere with the phagocytosis of an encapsulated GBS-strain opsonised by a specific antiserum either. In additional experiments we analysed the influence of the different surfactants on the release of reactive oxygen metabolite by PMN and found that the changes in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction did not necessarily correlate with the findings of the studies on killing. In conclusion, we found that killing by PMN was influenced by the bacterial species and the composition and concentration of the different surfactant preparations. The strongest impairment in phagocytic function of PMN was observed with the protein-free synthetic surfactant Exosurf, a phospholipid preparation that contains the alcohols hexadecanol and tyloxapol as spreading agents.
TI  - Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are the leading cause of neonatal meningitis and sepsis worldwide. The current treatment strategy is limited to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in pregnant women to prevent early-onset neonatal diseases, but considering the potential for antibiotic resistance, the risk of losing control over the disease is high. To approach this problem, we have developed a bacteriophage (phage) lytic enzyme to remove colonizing GBS. Bacteriophage muralytic enzymes, termed lysins, are highly evolved molecules designed to degrade the cell wall of host bacteria to release phage particles from the bacterial cytoplasm. Several different lysins have been developed to specifically kill bacterial pathogens both on mucosal surfaces and in blood and represent a novel approach to control infection. A lysin cloned from a phage infecting GBS was found to contain two putative catalytic domains and one putative binding domain, which is similar to the domain organization of some staphylococcal phage lysins. The lysin (named PlyGBS) was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified PlyGBS efficiently killed all tested GBS serotypes in vitro. In a mouse model, a single dose of PlyGBS significantly reduced bacterial colonization in both the vagina and oropharynx. As an alternative strategy for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, this approach may be used to reduce vaginal GBS colonization in pregnant women before delivery or to decontaminate newborns, thus reducing the incidence of GBS-associated neonatal meningitis and sepsis.

TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial activity evaluation of some new 1-benzoyl-isothiosemicarbazides.
AB  - The synthesis of some aroylisothiosemicarbazides was accomplished and their biological activity against bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria was investigated. Different synthetic pathways were followed according to the kind of substituents that were introduced on both the aroyl ring and the sulfur atom. Anti-bacterial activity was measured against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi, while antifungal activity was evaluated against C. albicans. Two species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV and Mycobacterium avium ATCC19421, were employed to evaluate antimycobacterial activity.
TI  - Prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal disease: progress, challenges and dilemmas.
AB  - Significant advances in the prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease have occurred in the last decade. In Australia, as well as in centres overseas, intrapartum penicillin given to carrier mothers has been shown to unequivocally decrease early onset neonatal GBS sepsis. In choosing which women should receive intrapartum chemoprophylaxis, recent data suggest that screening programmes for the detection of GBS carriage may be more effective than risk-based strategies to prevent early onset neonatal GBS sepsis. Combined vaginal and rectal swabs, collected between 35 and 37 weeks gestation, either by a health care worker or by the patient herself and inoculated onto selective media after enrichment provide the optimum conditions to detect carriage. Increasingly erythromycin and clindamycin resistance is being described overseas, which may influence the choice of antibiotics used in those allergic to penicillin. Widespread antibiotic use, particularly with broad-spectrum agents, may lead to increasing neonatal sepsis with ampicillin resistant organisms. Whilst rates of non-GBS neonatal sepsis are generally stable there is evidence suggesting that Escherichia coli sepsis in premature infants is increasing. Novel vaccination strategies for GBS are being developed that may ultimately provide broader protection for mothers and babies and eliminate the need for intrapartum antibiotics.
TI  - Chemoenzymatic synthesis of CMP-sialic acid derivatives by a one-pot two-enzyme system: comparison of substrate flexibility of three microbial CMP-sialic acid synthetases.
AB  - Three C terminal His6-tagged recombinant microbial CMP-sialic acid synthetases [EC 2.7.7.43] cloned from Neisseria meningitidis group B, Streptococcus agalactiae serotype V, and Escherichia coli K1, respectively, were evaluated for their ability in the synthesis of CMP-sialic acid derivatives in a one-pot two-enzyme system. In this system, N-acetylmannosamine or mannose analogs were condensed with pyruvate, catalyzed by a recombinant sialic acid aldolase [EC 4.1.3.3] cloned from E. coli K12 to provide sialic acid analogs as substrates for the CMP-sialic acid synthetases. The substrate flexibility and the reaction efficiency of the three recombinant CMP-sialic acid synthetases were compared, first by qualitative screening using thin layer chromatography, and then by quantitative analysis using high performance liquid chromatography. The N. meningitidis synthetase was shown to have the highest expression level, the most flexible substrate specificity, and the highest catalytic efficiency among the three synthetases. Finally, eight sugar nucleotides, including cytidine 5'-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) and its derivatives with substitutions at carbon-5, carbon-8, or carbon-9 of Neu5Ac, were synthesized in a preparative (100-200 mg) scale from their 5- or 6-carbon sugar precursors using the N. meningitidis synthetase and the aldolase.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Bacterial capsular polysaccharide and sugar transferases.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides (CPs) of several pathogenic bacteria are thought to be good materials for the development of new therapeutic reagents. These polysaccharides can be used as vaccines against infection of pathogenic bacteria and are also useful as inhibitors for disease caused by aberrant and abnormal cell-cell interaction, such as cancer metastasis and inflammation. Since bacterial CPs are diverse in structure and these bacteria have a variety of sugar transferases responsible for the synthesis of CPs, bacterial CP synthesis (cps) genes have attracted much interest as a source of glycosyltransferases useful for glycoengineering. In this review, we describe physiological effects of the bacterial CPs on mammalian cells, and the structure and function of the cps genes, by focusing on group B streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia and Ib, that produce high-molecular weight polysaccharides consisting of the following pentasaccharide repeating units: -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1--> and -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)beta-D-Glcp-(1-->, respectively.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).

TI  - Seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight European countries.
AB  - This study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). Strains originated in bovine diseases from eight European countries. They were isolated from gut infections (Escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus). There was no change in the MIC distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. In E. coli, a resistant population was present before the use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. Over this period the only a significant change seen was an increase in MIC(90) of E. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995 to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). All the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a MIC(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. The use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.
TI  - Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome: brain death following hemodialysis for metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure--a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS) is the clinical phenomenon of  acute neurologic symptoms attributed to cerebral edema that occurs during or following intermittent hemodialysis (HD). We describe a case of DDS-induced cerebral edema that resulted in irreversible brain injury and death following acute HD and review the relevant literature of the association of DDS and HD. CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old male with obstructive uropathy presented to hospital with severe sepsis syndrome secondary to pneumonia. Laboratory investigations included a pH of 6.95, PaCO2 10 mmHg, HCO3 2 mmol/L, serum sodium 132 mmol/L, serum osmolality 330 mosmol/kg, and urea 130 mg/dL (46.7 mmol/L). Diagnostic imaging demonstrated multifocal pneumonia, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening. During HD the patient became progressively obtunded. Repeat laboratory investigations showed pH 7.36, HCO3 19 mmol/L, potassium 1.8 mmol/L, and urea 38.4 mg/dL (13.7 mmol/L) (urea-reduction-ratio 71%). Following HD, spontaneous movements were absent with no pupillary or brainstem reflexes. Head CT-scan showed diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of basal cisterns and generalized loss of gray-white differentiation. Brain death was declared. CONCLUSIONS: Death is a rare consequence of DDS in adults following HD. Several features may have predisposed this patient to DDS including: central nervous system adaptations from chronic kidney disease with efficient serum urea removal and correction of serum hyperosmolality; severe cerebral intracellular acidosis; relative hypercapnea; and post-HD hemodynamic instability with compounded cerebral ischemia.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - Characterization of a complex restriction-modification system detected in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae strains isolated from infections of domestic animals.
AB  - Characterization of classic type II restriction-modification systems (RMS) (restriction endonucleases and modification methyltransferases) was carried out in isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae obtained from clinical material. Among the 100 isolates of S. aureus two different RMS type II were detected. The first was expressed in isolates 32 and 33 (Sau32 I and Sau33 I); the targeting sequence was determined as 5'-GGN CC-3' (Sau96 I isoschizomer). The second was found in isolates no. 90, 93, 96*, and 98 (Sau90 I, Sau93 I, Sau96* I, Sau98 I) and enzymes recognized sequence 5'-CTY RAG-3' (SmlI isoschizomer). Analysis of 40 isolates of S. agalactiae revealed only one RMS; it was detected in two isolates (no. 16 and 23; Sag16 I and Sag23 I). Restriction endonuclease expressed by these isolates cleaved DNA in sequence 5'-CTG CA/G-3' (PstI isoschizomer). In RMS-positive S. aureus and S. agalactiae isolates plasmid DNA capable of replication in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis was also detected and isolated.
TI  - The bifunctional peptidoglycan lysin of Streptococcus agalactiae bacteriophage B30.
AB  - A group B streptococcal (GBS) bacteriophage lysin gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme, calculated to have a molecular mass of 49 677 Da, lysed GBS cells. The susceptibility of GBS cells to lysis by the enzyme depended upon the growth stage at which they were harvested, with early exponential phase cells most sensitive. Calcium ions enhanced the activity of the enzyme. The enzyme also lysed other beta-haemolytic streptococci, including groups A, C, E and G streptococci, but not common oral streptococci, including Streptococcus mutans. The generation of both reducing activity and N-terminal alanine residues during lysis indicated that the lysin is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing both glycosidase and endopeptidase activities. This is consistent with the presence of two conserved sequence domains, an Acm (acetylmuramidase) domain associated with lysozyme activity, and a CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases) domain associated with endopeptidase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the CHAP domain and conserved aspartate and glutamate residues in the Acm domain confirmed their importance for lysozyme and endopeptidase activity respectively.
TI  - Ten-year study on the effect of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on early onset group B streptococcal and Escherichia coli neonatal sepsis in Australasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrapartum antibiotics have reduced the incidence of neonatal early  onset (EO) group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. Some surveillance data suggest that this success may be at the cost of increasing rates of non-GBS infection, especially in premature neonates. OBJECTIVE: To examine rates of EOGBS infection and EO Escherichia coli neonatal sepsis in Australasia. METHODOLOGY: Analysis of trends in EO (<48 h age) GBS and E. coli sepsis from longitudinal prospective surveillance data collected from representative tertiary obstetric hospitals in each state of Australia and selected centers in New Zealand during a 10-year period from 1992 through 2001. Statistical analysis used Poisson regression. RESULTS: 206 GBS and 96 E. coli cases occurred in 298,319 live births during the study period. The EOGBS sepsis rate fell from a peak of 1.43/1000 live births in 1993 to 0.25/1000 in 2001 (P < 0.001). The overall EO E. coli sepsis rate was 0.32/1000. In babies with birth weight <1500 g, it was 6.20/1000. There was an overall trend to decreasing EO E. coli sepsis (P = 0.07), and there was no significant change in E. coli sepsis in babies <1500 g (P = 0.60). Sixty-nine percent of E. coli cases occurred in the <1500 g cohort; the case fatality rate in this group was 50%. The overall case fatality rate from E. coli sepsis was 36%, and this rate remained stable during the study period (P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: The increasing use of intrapartum antibiotics produced a steady decline in EOGBS disease in Australasia. There was also a trend to decreasing EO E. coli sepsis in all babies, and the rate in very low birth weight infants remained stable.
TI  - Cloning, overexpression, and characterization of a serine/threonine protein kinase pknI from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.
AB  - Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation is the principal mechanism for translation of external signals into cellular responses. Eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases have been reported to play important roles in bacterial development and/or virulence. The PknI protein is one of the 11 eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. From the bioinformatic studies, PknI protein has been shown to have an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a transmembrane region and an extracellular C-terminus suggestive of a sensor molecule. In this study, we have cloned, overexpressed, and characterized the entire coding region and the cytoplasmic domain of PknI as a fusion protein with an N-terminal histidine tag, and used immobilized metal affinity chromatography for purification of recombinant proteins. The purified recombinant proteins were found to be functionally active through in vitro phosphorylation assay and phosphoamino acid analysis. In vitro kinase assay of both proteins revealed that PknI is capable of autophosphorylation and showed manganese-dependent activity. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues. Southern blot analysis with genomic DNA highlighted the conserved nature of pknI among the various mycobacterial species. In silico analysis revealed a close homology of PknI to Stk1 from Streptococcus agalactiae, shown to have a role in virulence and cell segregation of the organism.

TI  - Testing two Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
AB  - Two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus T-135 and Lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. Both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants: the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognostic factors.
AB  - This 16-year (1986-2001) retrospective study enrolled 80 infantile patients (aged, 30-365 days old) with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. The most prevalent pathogens were Salmonellaspecies, Streptococcus (S.) agalactiae, Escherichia (E.) coli, and Haemophilus (H.) influenzae, accounting for about 59% of the episodes. Meningitis caused by Salmonella species, E. coli and H. influenzae occurs more often in the older infants, while that caused by S. agalactiae occurs more often in young infants. Our study revealed a decrease in the proportion of Salmonella meningitis from 27% in the first 8 years to 9% in the second 8 years with E. coli replacing Salmonella species as the leading pathogen of this disease during the second period. Overall mortality rate for both periods of time was 11%. However, if we take those with undesirable poor outcomes into account, 43% of patients could be considered treatment failures. The study also reveals a high prevalence of neurological complications when this disease is caused by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Salmonella species. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only initial changing levels of consciousness (P = 0.006) were independently associated with treatment failure. The most frequent neurological complications associated with this disease included subdural empyema, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarctions, and seizures. Because therapeutic regimens may require attention to the eradication of bacterial pathogen but also the neurological complications, early diagnosis and choice of appropriate antibiotics are essential to increasing the possibility of survival.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - Comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme M and  P.
AB  - Lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. Mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme M and P, but only the M enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. Disruption of the lysozyme M locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a Gram-negative bacterium. Unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme M-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. Muramidase activity in lysozyme M-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme P mRNA and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. The muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme P was less than that of recombinant M lysozyme. Recombinant P lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected Gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme M to achieve the same level of killing. The lower antimicrobial activity of P lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by P lysozyme in lysozyme M-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. Recombinant lysozyme M and P were equally effective in killing selected Gram-positive organisms. This outcome suggests that disruption of both M and P loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - The NeuC protein of Escherichia coli K1 is a UDP N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase.
AB  - The K1 capsule is an essential virulence determinant of Escherichia coli strains  that cause meningitis in neonates. Biosynthesis and transport of the capsule, an alpha-2,8-linked polymer of sialic acid, are encoded by the 17-kb kps gene cluster. We deleted neuC, a K1 gene implicated in sialic acid synthesis, from the chromosome of EV36, a K-12-K1 hybrid, by allelic exchange. Exogenously added sialic acid restored capsule expression to the deletion strain (DeltaneuC), confirming that NeuC is necessary for sialic acid synthesis. The deduced amino acid sequence of NeuC showed similarities to those of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 2-epimerases from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The NeuC homologue from serotype III Streptococcus agalactiae complements DeltaneuC. We cloned the neuC gene into an intein expression vector to facilitate purification. We demonstrated by paper chromatography that the purified neuC gene product catalyzed the formation of [2-(14)C]acetamidoglucal and [N-(14)C]acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) from UDP-[(14)C]GlcNAc. The formation of reaction intermediate 2-acetamidoglucal with the concomitant release of UDP was confirmed by proton and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. NeuC could not use GlcNAc as a substrate. These data suggest that neuC encodes an epimerase that catalyzes the formation of ManNAc from UDP-GlcNAc via a 2-acetamidoglucal intermediate. The unexpected release of the glucal intermediate and the extremely low rate of ManNAc formation likely were a result of the in vitro assay conditions, in which a key regulatory molecule or protein was absent.
TI  - A GapC chimera retains the properties of the Streptococcus uberis wild-type GapC  protein.
AB  - The GapC products of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis share considerable homology at the DNA and amino acid levels. The high similarity at the protein level suggests that one GapC protein might be used as a single antigen to protect dairy cows against infections with the contagious S. agalactiae and the environmental S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis strains. Despite their similarities, immunization with the S. dysgalactiae GapC did not protect dairy cows from a challenge with S. uberis, suggesting the presence of regions in GapC that are involved in species-specific protection. To produce a single antigen that can be used to protect against all streptococcal mastitis infections, we constructed a GapC chimeric protein using the S. uberis GapC product as the backbone followed by non-conserved peptide regions from the S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae GapC proteins. We report that the chimeric GapC protein retains the enzymatic activity of the S. uberis GapC protein. In addition, we fused the chimera to the OmpF and LipoF transport sequences of Escherichia coli and the GapC chimeras were present in membrane fractions of E. coli. These extracts could be the basis of an antigen preparation for use in mastitis vaccines.
TI  - Results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination in Wisconsin from 1994 to 2001.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory between 1994 and 2001. Results (n = 83,650) of microbiological testing of milk samples (n = 77,172) submitted to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from January 1994 until June 2001 were analyzed. Submissions included milk samples obtained from cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis as well as samples obtained for mastitis surveillance programs. Results were recorded as no growth, contaminated, or identified as specific bacterial pathogens. Statistical analysis was performed to determine trends in the isolation of mastitis pathogens. The proportion of samples identified as contaminated decreased from 20.6 (1997) to 9.5% (2001). The proportion of samples coded as no growth increased from 22.6 (1994) to 49.7% (2001). Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 17.7% (1994) of isolates to 9.7% (2001), while isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased from 8.1 (1994) to 3.0% (2001). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 12.7 to 17.5%, environmental Streptococcus spp. were isolated from 11.6 to 20.1%, and Escherichia coli were isolated from 3.1 to 6.7% of all isolates. No growth and contaminated samples comprised almost 50% of total submissions, and it is important that producers have proper expectations when submitting milk samples. The proportion of isolates identified as Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae decreased, suggesting the proportion of contagious bacteria causing mastitis has decreased. Environmental and contagious pathogens demonstrated characteristic differences by season.
TI  - [Cost benefit analysis of body surface cultures at a neonatal unit].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infection continues to be a cause of concern in neonatal units. The high cost of the body surface cultures used to study infection and their limited utility is controversial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of newborns admitted for suspected infection in 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Request criteria, cost, and the clinical utility of body surface cultures were analyzed. RESULTS: In 1999, body surface cultures were requested in 204 newborns admitted to hospital (70 % of all admitted newborns). Of these, six were diagnosed with bacteremia (6.23/1000; 95 % CI: 5.9-6.5). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. The total cost of body surface cultures was 6,510.95 euros (1,083,331 pesetas). In 25 % of cases the results of cultures influenced clinical decision making. The cost necessary to obtain clinical repercussion in a patient was 191.50 euros (31,863 pesetas). Requesting two body surface cultures only (otic and umbilical) halved the cost without diminishing their clinical utility. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable percentage of newborns admitted to hospital present suspected infection requiring microbiological studies. Although the cost of body surface cultures is high, the results of these cultures influence diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in a quarter of patients. We do not believe that eliminating the use of these cultures would be beneficial. However, their cost can be reduced by carefully selecting request criteria and by limiting cultures to two samples (otic and umbilical).
TI  - NMR and molecular modeling of complex carbohydrates and carbohydrate-protein interactions. Applications to anti-bacteria vaccines.
AB  - In order to characterize the conformational epitope of the group B meningococcal  polysaccharide and of the type III group B Streptococcus capsular polysaccharide NMR measurements were done on a wide variety of native and modified polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Since these saccharides are highly mobile and exist as random coils in solution, the analysis of the NMR data and molecular modeling was done to take into account this inherent flexibility. The conformational model of extended high-order helices being selected upon binding to a protein, although still hypothetical at this stage, has proven useful in explaining the serology for the conformational epitopes for polysaccharides of group B Neisseria meningitidis, group B Streptococcus type III and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in South Croatia: aetiology and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of uropathogens isolated  from outpatients living in South Croatia and the in vitro susceptibility of these organisms to antimicrobial agents. Of 5080 enrolled uropathogen isolates, 82.28% isolates were Gram-negative, the most frequent isolates being Escherichia coli (62.62%), enterococci (10.18%), Proteus mirabilis (5.31%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3.84%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.70%), Pseudomonas spp. (3.46%), Klebsiella spp. (2.38%). The E. coli resistance rate was 42.17% to amoxycillin, 20.59% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and 6.09% to norfloxacin. Almost all Klebsiella spp. isolates were resistant to amoxycillin and the resistance rate to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was over 20%, and 14.15% to the fluoroquinolones. A high methicillin-resistance rate was found among S. aureus (61.22%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (41.48).
TI  - Epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the USA and Europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - Susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in hospitalised patients were studied. Data were reported by clinical laboratories in the USA, France, Germany, Italy and Spain during 2001 which participate in The Surveillance Network (TSN). Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. MRSA was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of S. aureus in each country, respectively. The majority of MRSA were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (France) to 15.9% (Italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (France) to 87.0% (Italy) resistant. More than 99.0% of MSSA tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (France) to 94.6% of MSSA (Germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (USA) to 86.6% (Spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (Italy) to 99.2% (France) were gentamicin susceptible. MSSA were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. Overall, 100% of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Macrolide resistance was common among S. agalactiae (20.7%, Germany to 10%, Italy and Spain), S. pyogenes (19.2%, France to 11.1%, USA) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, France to 14.1%, Germany). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside the USA (17.5%) and Italy (7.4%). For all countries susceptibility of E. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Susceptibility of E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in Spain to 94.3% in Germany. Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. Putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in E. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in USA, Italy and Spain and in France and Germany <2%. For P. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. Surveillance data should be considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating SSTI.
TI  - Effects of antenatal antibiotics on the incidence and bacteriological profile of  early-onset neonatal sepsis. A retrospective study over five years.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recommendations for the use of antenatal antibiotics have been widely implemented in the past few years, notably to prevent group B streptococcal disease or to prolong pregnancy in the case of preterm premature rupture of the membranes. OBJECTIVES: We designed a retrospective study to assess the potential effects of this increasing use of antibiotics on the incidence and bacteriological profile of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS). METHODS: All neonates referred to our department for suspected EONS from January 1 1995 through December 31 1999 were included. Antenatal antibiotic exposure together with clinical and microbiological data from the neonatal period were gathered and analyzed on a yearly basis. RESULTS: Of the 485 newborns who met the inclusion criteria, there were 101 cases of culture-confirmed sepsis; 339 cases of suspected sepsis and 69 cases of confirmed sepsis involved children born in the hospital, among a total of 16,627 live births registered in our center over the study period. The overall incidence of EONS dropped from 6.8 to 0.6/1,000 births between 1995 and 1999 (p < 0.001), but the rate of group B streptococcal infection decreased much more rapidly than that of non-group B streptococcal infection. We observed a trend towards the emergence of ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli strains, which were isolated in seven cases. Among E. COLI infections, ampicillin resistance was statistically linked with antenatal antibiotic use (p = 0.025). We also delineated several risk factors associated with these infections. CONCLUSION: In our center, antenatal antibiotic treatment was effective in reducing the incidence of EONS, but this benefit may come at the cost of favoring the emergence of ampicillin-resistant organisms causing severe neonatal infections. Antenatal and postnatal antibiotic treatment strategies should take this adverse effect into account.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Etiology of persistent tubo-ovarian abscess in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbial etiology of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). METHODS: We recruited 11 women in Nairobi, Kenya who failed antibiotic therapy alone and required surgical drainage of a presumptive TOA. Pus from the nine abscesses and two pyosalpinges were collected and cultured for aerobic, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. RESULTS: Eleven women suspected of having a TOA were hospitalized and treated for a median of 6 days (range 3-14 days) prior to surgical drainage of the abscess. Nine (82%) specimens were culture positive. Aerobes were present in all nine specimens. Seven of the nine positive cultures (78%) were polymicrobial and five of the polymicrobial cultures contained both anaerobes and aerobes. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (Prevotella sp., Porphyromonas sp. and Bacteroides sp., Escherichia coli) and Streptococcus sp. (S. viridans and S. agalactiae) were the most common microorganisms isolated. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were not isolated by culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSIONS: In Kenya, persistent TOAs are associated with endogenous flora similar to that normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus agalactiae CAMP factor as a pore-forming toxin.
AB  - A recombinant form of CAMP factor of Streptococcus agalactiae has been expressed  as glutathione S-transferase-CAMP fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein, the recombinant CAMP factor exhibited hemolytic activity comparable with that of the native form. Osmotic protection experiments with polyethylene glycols show that CAMP factor forms discrete transmembrane pores with a diameter upward of 1.6 nm on susceptible membranes; electron microscopy reveals circular membrane lesions of heterogeneous size, up to 12-15 nm in diameter. Liposome permeabilization studies show that pore formation is a highly cooperative process, which suggests that it involves the oligomerization of CAMP factor. Chemical cross-linking experiments also support an oligomeric mode of action.
TI  - Occurrence of clinical and sub-clinical mastitis in dairy herds in the West Littoral Region in Uruguay.
AB  - Twenty-nine dairy farms were selected to determine the incidence of clinical mastitis, prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis and bacterial aetiology in the West Littoral Region of Uruguay. In samples taken by the owner and frozen at -20 degrees C during a week the incidence rate of clinical mastitis was determined as 1.2 cases per 100 cow-months at risk. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolated pathogen in 37.5% of 40 milk samples from clinical cases obtained in 1 month. No bacteria grew in the 32.5% of the total samples. A sub-sample including 1077 dairy cows from randomly selected farms was used to determine the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis. These samples were taken on one visit to each farm. The prevalence was 52.4% on a cow basis and 26.7% on an udder quarter basis. In 55.1% of the quarters of the selected animals with more than 300,000 cells/ml there was no growth. The isolated pathogens from sub-clinical cases and their relative frequencies were: Staphylococcus aureus 62.8%, Streptococcus agalactiae 11.3%, Enterococcus sp. 8%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 7.4%, Streptococus uberis 6.4%, Streptococcus dysgalactiae 1.8%, Escherichia coli 1.5% and Staphylococcus hyicus coagulase-positive 0.6%.
TI  - Bovine mastitis in selected areas of southern Ethiopia.
AB  - A study on bovine mastitis, designed to determine the causal agents, prevalence of infection and impact of risk factors in three cattle breeds, was conducted in selected areas of southern Ethiopia. A total of 307 lactating and non-lactating cows, of which 162 were indigenous Zebu, 85 Jersey and 60 Holstein-Friesian. were examined by clinical examination and the California mastitis (CMT) test. Of these, 40.4% were positive by CMT and bacteriology for clinical or subclinical mastitis, with prevalence rates of 37.1% and 62.9%, respectively. Out of 1133 quarters examined, 212 (18.7%) were found to be infected, 83 (39.21%) clinically and 129 (60.8%) subclinically. The prevalence of mastitis was significantly higher in Holstein-Friesian than in indigenous Zebu, in non-lactating cows than in lactating cows, in the early lactation stage than in the mid-lactation stage, in cows with lesions and/or tick infestation on skin of udder and/or teats than in cows without this factor, and in the wet season than in the dry season. Mastitis increased with parity number (R = 0.9). Of 248 CMT and clinically positive udder quarter samples analysed microbiologically, 212 were culturally positive for known mastitis pathogens and 36 were negative. Of the 199 positive samples. Staphylococcus accounted for 39.2%. Streptococcus for 23.6%, coliforms for 14.1%, Micrococcus and Bacillus species for 8.0% each and Actinomyces or Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) for 7.0%. It was concluded that there was a high prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli, in this study area.
TI  - Novel protein vaccine candidates against Group B streptococcal infection identified using alkaline phosphatase fusions.
AB  - Using an alkaline phosphatase-based genetic screening method, we identified a number of proteins that are potentially located on the outer surface of Group B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae). In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antisera raised against two of the proteins, the streptococcal yutD homologue and a subunit of an ABC transporter, recognised clinically important serotypes of Group B streptococcus. In a neonatal rat model, purified IgG from the sera conferred significant levels of protection against a lethal challenge infection. The proteins identified show potential as protein subunit candidates for vaccines against Group B streptococcal disease in neonates.
TI  - Umbilical cord blood serum procalcitonin concentration in the diagnosis of early  neonatal infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serum procalcitonin concentration in umbilical cord blood  for diagnosis of intrauterine bacterial infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted between 2000 and 2001. Serum procalcitonin concentrations were evaluated in 187 umbilical cord blood samples. Five groups have been defined: controls A (n=37), full-term noninfected B1 (n=80) and infected neonates B2 (n=8), preterm noninfected C1 (n=38) and infected C2 (n=24) newborns. An immunoluminometric assay was used to determine procalcitonin concentration. The Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman's correlation ratio were applied. The sensitivity and specificity, the positive and negative predictive values, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated. RESULTS: A statistically higher serum procalcitonin concentration was found in the preterm infected group (p<0.005; C2 vs A and C1). CONCLUSION: Serum procalcitonin concentration in umbilical cord blood may be a useful parameter in the diagnosis of early neonatal infection.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) production in Aeromonas hydrophila water isolates.
AB  - 30 Aeromonas hydrophila water isolates were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more indicator microorganisms, but the activity emerged only with non-phylogenetically related genera or species. In particular all A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more of the tested Staphylococcus strains, five against Listeria spp. (Listeria seeligeri, Listeria welshimeri and Listeria ivanovii), and eight presented a weak antagonistic activity towards Streptococcus agalactiae and Lactobacillus spp. Inhibitory activity was not observed against the other Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative tested strains, including Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae and the same A. hydrophila, when used as indicator. Anti-staphylococcal activity was observed with a gradual increase of the inhibition zone during incubation and seemed to be influenced by A. hydrophila hemolytic expression. Extrachromosomal analysis showed the presence, in 70% of the strains, of one to five plasmids with molecular masses ranging from 2.1 to 41.5 MDa, but it was not possible to relate this result with BLS production.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - Cloning, over-expression, purification, and characterisation of N-acetylneuraminate synthase from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - N-acetylneuraminate synthase (NeuAc-synthase; E.C. 4.1.3.19) is one of the two enzymes responsible for sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) synthesis in bacteria. Potential genes encoding NeuAc synthase in Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacillus subtilis were identified from a BLAST search of the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ database using the E. coli neuB gene sequence as a probe and the genes cloned and expressed at high level in Escherichia coli. The neuB gene of S. agalactiae was shown to encode an active NeuAc synthase, whereas the spsE gene product from B. subtilis did not have this activity. Expression of the native S. agalactiae neuB gene product enzyme in E. coli resulted in a product that was prone to proteolysis during purification so the protein was tagged with a hexa-histidine tag at its N-terminus and the enzyme was rapidly purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate fractionation and Ni-chelating affinity chromatography in two steps. Measurement of the subunit molecular mass by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (M(r) = 38, 987 +/- 3) and of the native molecular mass by gel filtration chromatography (M(r) = 78,000) clearly demonstrated that the enzyme is dimeric. The effects of EDTA, temperature, and pH on the activity of the S. agalactiae NeuAc synthase were examined. Enzyme activity was maximal at pH 7 and was dependent on the presence of metal ions such as Mg(2+), Mn(2+) or Co(2+). The purified enzyme was inhibited by the reagent phenylglyoxal and the substrates N-acetyl mannosamine or phosphoenol pyruvate afforded protection against this inhibition, suggesting that one or more arginine residues are involved in substrate recognition and binding. The ease of expression and the properties of the enzyme should now permit a thorough study of the specificity of the enzyme and provide the prerequisites for attempts to alter this specificity by directed evolution for the production of novel sialic acid analogues.
TI  - Wound erysipelas following appendectomy caused by group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Case description of a patient who developed erysipelas of the surgical wound following appendectomy for acute appendicitis, and literature review of invasive group B streptococcal infections. METHODS: A 65-year-old man with perforated appendicitis underwent urgent appendectomy and drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis with tobramycin (100 mg) and metronidazole (500 mg) was administered. At surgery, a phlegmon was identified with free perforation of the appendix and purulent peritoneal fluid. Appendectomy, irrigation with 0.9% NaCl solution, and drainage with a Silastic closed-suction drain was performed. A literature search in all languages was performed using MEDLINE, using the search terms surgical site infection, wound infection, group B streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae, necrotizing fasciitis, and postoperative infection. RESULTS: Erysipelas of the surgical wound developed on the fourth postoperative day. Intravenous penicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were administered empirically. Culture of the wound drainage identified Streptococcus agalactiae and a few colonies of Escherichia coli. The broad-spectrum antibiotic was discontinued, and a 10-day course of penicillin was completed. CONCLUSIONS: Erysipelas of the surgical wound is unusual, and infection with group B streptococci is rare compared with infection by group A streptococci. Streptococcus agalactiae is recognized to be increasingly virulent, with an increasing predilection for bacteremic infections in healthy hosts. Although Streptococcus agalactiae remains highly susceptible to antimicrobial agents effective against gram-positive cocci, the changing epidemiology and potentially invasive nature of these infections should have clinicians alert to the possibility of infection caused by group B streptococci.
TI  - [Role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. The participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of UTI; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. To gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in UTI. METHODS: A total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low UTI were analyzed. Samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and McConkey agar, as well as HBT medium for G. vaginalis, and U9B broth and agar E broth for M. hominis and U. urealyticum. The following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. RESULTS. There were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): G. vaginalis (25.7%), U. urealyticum (5.9%), S. agalactiae (3.4%) and M. hominis (2%). UTI were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of UTI.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - [Prognostic and therapeutic value of biologic signs of infection in the management of preterm labor (amniocentesis excepted)].
AB  - During threatened preterm delivery, both general and local signs of infection increase the risks of amniotic infection, premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and neonatal and/or maternal morbidity of infectious origin. Nonetheless, as antibiotics have not been sufficiently studied to be proved of benefit in chorioamnionitis with intact membranes, search for these general (C Reactive Protein, hyperleucocytosis) or cervical/vaginal (Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia Coli, bacterial vaginosis) signs of infection have not been proved to be really necessary. We have to except Group B Streptococcus, which have to be searched during weeks that precede delivery: in those cases where it is shown to be present in the cervix or the vagina, antibiotics must be prescribed during delivery (ANAES recommendation). Finally, it must be emphasized that these recommendations are mainly based on the absence of studies specifically done to prove the benefits or risks of antenatal antibiotics - or fetal extraction - in case of chorioamnionitis with intact membranes. Systematic vaginal and blood samples (CRP, leukocytes, vaginal micro-organisms) would be helpful in determining the appropriate option in those situations.
TI  - [Neonatal bacterial infection].
AB  - In our NICU, 70 patients with sepsis were examined and analyzed by birth weight,  onset day, causative pathogens, clinical symptoms and clinical examination values. Our study result showed the relationship between the birth weight and bacteriological infection rate: the lower birth weight was, the greater infection rate was. For low birth weight newborns, their onset were relatively late as horizontal transmission. For 50% of matured infants, they showed clinical symptom by 6 days after the birth. E. coli or/and S. agalactiae were identified from 57% patients of vertical transmission, and S. aureus and E. cloacae were the major pathogens of horizontal transmission. Low birth weight newborns did not show typical clinical symptoms and examination values. To prevent nosocomial infection, it is important to culture for monitoring and management of skin in addition to taking standard precaution.
TI  - Chlorhexidine vaginal flushings versus systemic ampicillin in the prevention of vertical transmission of neonatal group B streptococcus, at term.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of intrapartum vaginal flushings with chlorhexidine compared with ampicillin in preventing group B streptococcus transmission to neonates. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled study, including singleton pregnancies delivering vaginally. Rupture of membranes, when present, must not have occurred more than 6 h previously. Women with any gestational complication, with a newborn previously affected by group B streptococcus sepsis or whose cervical dilatation was greater than 5 cm were excluded. A total of 244 group B streptococcus-colonized mothers at term (screened at 36-38 weeks) were randomized to receive either 140 ml chlorhexidine 0.2% by vaginal flushings every 6 h or ampicillin 2 g intravenously every 6 h until delivery. Neonatal swabs were taken at birth, at three different sites (nose, ear and gastric juice). RESULTS: A total of 108 women were treated with ampicillin and 109 with chlorhexidine. Their ages and gestational weeks at delivery were similar in the two groups. Nulliparous women were equally distributed between the two groups (ampicillin, 87%; chlorhexidine, 89%). Clinical data such as birth weight (ampicillin, 3,365 +/- 390 g; chlorhexidine, 3,440 +/- 452 g), Apgar scores at 1 min (ampicillin, 8.4 +/- 0.9; chlorhexidine, 8.2 +/- 1.4) and at 5 min (ampicillin, 9.7 +/- 0.6; chlorhexidine, 9.6 +/- 1.1) were similar for the two groups, as was the rate of neonatal group B streptococcus colonization (chlorhexidine, 15.6%; ampicillin, 12%). Escherichia coli, on the other hand, was significantly more prevalent in the ampicillin (7.4%) than in the chlorhexidine group (1.8%, p < 0.05). Six neonates were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, including two cases of early-onset sepsis (one in each group). CONCLUSIONS: In this carefully screened target population, intrapartum vaginal flushings with chlorhexidine in colonized mothers display the same efficacy as ampicillin in preventing vertical transmission of group B streptococcus. Moreover, the rate of neonatal E. coli colonization was reduced by chlorhexidine.
TI  - [Use of MPO chromogenic culture medium for routine processing of urine cultures].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The chromogenic culture medium, MPO, was compared to culture on CLED  (cystein, lactose, electrolyte-deficient) agar for the detection, enumeration and identification of urinary tract pathogens. METHODS: A total of 1,080 clinical urine specimens were assessed. All samples were inoculated in MPO and CLED using the calibrated loop method. RESULTS: Among 145 positive urine samples, 171 strains of bacteria were isolated (111 Escherichia coli, 26 Enterococcus spp., 12 Proteus spp., 10 Enterobacteriaceae from the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Streptococcus agalactiae, 3 Staphylococcus spp. and 4 Candida albicans. For all samples, enumeration of microorganisms was comparable with the two media studied. Identification was also similar, except for 6 cases in which Enterococcus spp. were only detected with the chromogenic medium. CONCLUSIONS: Overall urine culture results with MPO chromogenic medium were similar to those obtained with CLED, making it a feasible alternative to the standard medium. Moreover, use of a chromogenic technique implies a significant reduction in workload, since additional tests to identify the microorganisms isolated are not needed in most cases.
TI  - Trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance of early-onset sepsis: population-based surveillance in San Francisco and Atlanta.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although increased use of intrapartum antibiotics caused significant declines in early-onset group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection, the effect on infections caused by other pathogens is not clear. The objective of this study was to determine trends in the incidence of early-onset sepsis caused by organisms other than group B streptococcus in the era of antimicrobial prophylaxis. METHODS: We conducted surveillance for early-onset sepsis as part of the Active Bacterial Core surveillance. A case was defined as isolation of bacteria from blood or cerebrospinal fluid from an infant who was 0 to 6 days of age and born in the surveillance area during 1998 through 2000 (248 184 births). RESULTS: We identified 408 cases of early-onset infection. GBS caused 166 (40.7%) cases (52 in 1998, 51 in 1999, and 63 in 2000 for incidences 0.62, 0.62, and 0.76 cases per 1000 live births, respectively). Other bacterial pathogens were identified in 242 cases (82 in 1998, 79 in 1999, and 81 in 2000 for incidences 0.99, 0.95, and 0.98 per 1000 live births, respectively) of early-onset sepsis. Escherichia coli caused 70 cases (0.25, 0.28, and 0.31 cases per 1000 live births, respectively, in 1998-2000). The proportion of E coli infections that were resistant to ampicillin increased significantly among preterm infants from 29% (2 of 7) in 1998 to 84% (16 of 18) in 2000 but not in full-term infants: 50% (4 of 8) in 1998 and 25% (1 of 4) in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas rates of early-onset sepsis caused by GBS and other pathogens were low and did not change significantly during the study period, antibiotic-resistant E coli infections among preterm infants increased. Overall, these trends are reassuring, but careful evaluation of the increase in resistant infections in very young infants is critical in the future.
TI  - Perinatal antibiotic usage and changes in colonization and resistance rates of group B streptococcus and other pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify current antibiotic usage during the perinatal period and impact on vaginal-rectal colonizing organism resistance rates. METHODS: Swabs were obtained for culture of group B streptococcus and other bacteria from a cohort of 1207 pregnant women in Calgary, Alberta, at 36 weeks' gestation. Those women who received antibiotics during labor or after pregnancy and a 10% subset who received no antibiotics had repeat cultures at 6 weeks postpartum. Cultured organisms were tested for sensitivity to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Group B streptococcus was identified in 235 women (19.5%) in the antepartum period. Fifty-one percent of all participants received antibiotics (31.4% intrapartum). Group B streptococcus prophylaxis was given to 215 (17.8%), whereas 83 (6.9%) group B streptococcus-negative women without fever during labor received antibiotics. Ampicillin (49%), cefazolin (28%), and penicillin (18%) were the most frequently used antibiotics. Resistance rates among group B streptococcus to erythromycin and clindamycin were 5.6% and 3.0%, respectively, whereas 20.6% of Escherichia coli were ampicillin resistant. Among antibiotic recipients, 6.3% of all bacteria that were initially sensitive on prenatal cultures to a specific antibiotic became resistant in the postnatal period, whereas 6.5% that were initially resistant became sensitive. CONCLUSION: Current prevention practices in our region were associated with perinatal antibiotic administration in over half of pregnant women. Ampicillin was the most common antibiotic administered. Some physicians are treating women who are group B streptococcus culture negative at term, a practice that is of no proven value. However, this was not associated with increased resistance for group B streptococcus or other organisms identified from maternal vaginal-rectal tracts.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - The effect of meconium staining of amniotic fluid on the growth of Escherichia coli and group B streptococcus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of meconium staining on the growth rate of Escherichia coli and group B streptococci (GBS) in amniotic fluid. STUDY DESIGN: Sterile meconium was added in different concentrations to pooled sterile amniotic fluid obtained from term mothers. Meconium concentration was equal to: 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 mg meconium/ml amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid was quantitatively inoculated with E. coli and GBS type II and type III organisms (10(3) organisms/ml). Clear amniotic fluid and Todd-Hewitt broth served as controls. Growth rates of organisms were measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after inoculation. RESULTS: Clear amniotic fluid was completely inhibitory for growth of E. coli even after 24 hours of incubation. In contrast, after 6 hours of incubation, significantly increased growth of GBS occurred (10(5) organisms/ml) (p<0.0001). The inhibitory effect on E. coli was observed even with meconium concentration of up to 1.5 mg/ml. In contrast, even the smallest concentration of meconium (1 mg/ml) resulted in a 2-log fold increase of GBS within 4 hours. The more rapid growth rate of GBS compared to E. coli persisted even at moderate staining of amniotic fluid (6 mg/ml) in the first 8 hours of incubation (p<0.005). In the presence of thick meconium (12 mg/ml), during the first 6 hours of incubation, the growth rates of GBS and E. coli were nearly similar. CONCLUSIONS: GBS (type II and III) growth, in contrast to E. coli, was less inhibited by amniotic fluid, occurred at a more rapid rate, and was enhanced at lower concentrations of meconium. As such, the presence of even light meconium staining in cases of rupture of membranes of even less than 6 hours in a mother who is a GBS carrier should be considered as a risk factor for the development of perinatal GBS infection.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.

TI  - Changes in pathogens causing early-onset sepsis in very-low-birth-weight infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether the rates and causes of early-onset sepsis (that occurring within 72 hours after birth) among very-low-birth-weight infants have changed in recent years, since antibiotics have begun to be used more widely during labor and delivery. METHODS: We studied 5447 very-low-birth-weight infants (those weighing between 401 and 1500 g) born at centers of the Neonatal Research Network of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development between 1998 and 2000 who had at least one blood culture in the first three days of life and compared them with 7606 very-low-birth-weight infants born at centers in the network between 1991 and 1993. RESULTS: Early-onset sepsis (as confirmed by positive blood cultures) was present in 84 infants in the more recent birth cohort (1.5 percent). As compared with the earlier birth cohort, there was a marked reduction in group B streptococcal sepsis (from 5.9 to 1.7 per 1000 live births of infants weighing 401 to 1500 g, P<0.001) and an increase in Escherichia coli sepsis (from 3.2 to 6.8 per 1000 live births, P=0.004); the overall rate of early-onset sepsis was not significantly changed. Most E. coli isolates from the recent birth cohort (85 percent) were resistant to ampicillin, and mothers of infants with ampicillin-resistant E. coli infections were more likely to have received intrapartum ampicillin than were those with ampicillin-sensitive strains (26 of 28 with sensitivity data vs. 1 of 5, P=0.01). Infants with early-onset sepsis were more likely to die than uninfected infants (37 percent vs. 13 percent, P<0.001), especially if they were infected with gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset sepsis remains an uncommon but potentially lethal problem among very-low-birth-weight infants. The change in pathogens over time from predominantly gram-positive to predominantly gram-negative requires confirmation by ongoing surveillance.
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - Trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  - Milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University, for bacteriologic culture. A total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards. Isolates included in this study were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcesens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. However, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of S. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. For Strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. For Strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. For Strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. Among E. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. Among K pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. Overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of two commercial chromogenic media for detection and presumptive identification of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - The performance of two commercial chromogenic media for the isolation and presumptive identification of urinary tract pathogens, the CPS ID2 (bioMerieux, France) and the CHROMagar Orientation (BBL Becton Dickinson, USA), was evaluated and compared with that of cystine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar and tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood. The detection, determination of bacterial counts, and presumptive identification of bacteria causing urinary tract infections were evaluated in 3,000 urine specimens. The two chromogenic media showed excellent correlation with the standard media for the detection and the bacterial count of urinary pathogens. The Escherichia coli strains produced the expected colour on the CHROMagar Orientation and the CPS ID2 media in 99% and 90% of the cases, respectively. The Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Citrobacter and the Proteus-Morganella-Providencia groups were easily identified on both chromogenic media, but further biochemical tests were needed to differentiate them to a species level. Both media enabled the differentiation, with varying degrees of difficulty, of Pseudomonas spp. strains from members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. All isolates of Enterococcus spp. were correctly identified and were easily distinguished from the Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. Staphylococcus saprophyticus isolates were easy to identify only on the CHROMagar Orientation medium. No substantial difference was observed when comparing the results of the susceptibility tests, which were performed according to the standardized disk diffusion method as described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, for colonies recovered from the blood agar versus those recovered from the chromogenic media. In conclusion, the CPS ID2 and CHROMagar Orientation media enabled excellent detection, count determination, and presumptive identification of urinary pathogens, both in pure and mixed cultures, and reliable and accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing directly from primary isolates. Moreover, these media allowed a remarkable reduction in the workload and a significant savings of time. On the basis of their performance, these media can replace the standard primary plating media used in the routine diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Cervicovaginal infection as a risk factor for premature labor].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible association between cervicovaginal infections (CVI) and preterm delivery. DESIGN: Cohorts. REFERENCE FRAME: Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, Hospital Central Militar and Hospital General Regional No. 1, IMSS, Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. PATIENTS: Four hundred and sixty eight patients attending prenatal control and delivery care. INTERVENTIONS: Fresh smears, Gram stain, and cervicovaginal sample culture from samples obtained during the following gestational stages: First sample at 16-24 weeks, second sample at 25-32 weeks, and third sample at 33-42 weeks. The following microorganisms were studied: Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. In case of a positive culture, the specific treatment was indicated. MEASUREMENTS: Positive or negative culture for each of the studied pathogens, and the presence or absence of a preterm delivery for each of the patients included in the study. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety eight were still present at the end of the study, of which 156 had a CVI and 242 had no CVI. No differences between both groups were observed concerning preterm delivery. Significant relative risks were: In the first stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis with RR = 9.0 (6.81, 11.8); in the second stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 6.2 (3.30, 11.7) and Escherichia coli with RR = 3.4 (1.33, 8.6); in the third stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 9.19 (6.93, 12.1). The logistic regression analysis identified Ureaplasma urealyticum during the second stage with OR = 16.6 (2.9, 93.7), statistically significant with p = 0.001. The survival analysis showed differences between the two groups concerning pregnancy duration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a difference in the duration in pregnancy in patients with CVI and without CVI. Ureaplasma urealyticum is consistently associated with preterm delivery.
TI  - [Neonatal meningitis. Epidemiological study of the Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcomes of vertically transmitted and nosocomial meningitis in neonates over a two-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases of neonatal meningitis diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998 in the neonatology departments of 28 acute-care hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo") were prospectively studied. Bacteriological meningitis was considered confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid culture (CSF) was positive for bacteria, virus or fungi, probable when CSF culture was negative but blood culture was positive, and unconfirmed when both cultures were negative. RESULTS: During the study period, 151 cases of meningitis were diagnosed. Transmission was vertical in 84 cases and nosocomial in 67. The incidence of vertically transmitted meningitis was 0.51 of live births, and was significantly higher in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 66 patients (78.6 %). No risk factors were identified in 46.4 % of the patients. Group B Streptococcus (agalactiae) was isolated in 48.5 % of cases of confirmed meningitis and Escherichia coli was isolated in 18.2 %. In 69.7 % of cases the results of blood culture were in agreement with those of CSF culture. The overall mortality rate was 8.3 %; mortality was significantly higher in VLBW infants (33.3 % vs 4.2 % in infants weighing 1,500 g). Thirteen percent of survivors had sequelae. The incidence of meningitis of nosocomial transmission was 0.2 % of admissions and was more frequent in VLBW infants. Confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 49 patients (73.1 %). Two or more risk factors were present in 62.7 % of patients. E. coli was isolated in 26.5 % of cases of nosocomial meningitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 24.5 %. In 55 % of patients the results of blood culture agreed with those of CSF culture. The overall mortality rate was 19.4 %. Mortality was significantly higher in VLBW infants and 18.5 % of survivors showed sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, mortality and sequelae of neonatal meningitis in Spain were similar to those reported in recent studies. The most commonly isolated pathogens were group B Streptococcus in vertically transmitted meningitis and E. coli and S. epidermidis in nosocomial meningitis. We believe the distinction between vertical and nosocomial meningitis to be appropriate because the epidemiology of these diseases is different, which implies a different therapeutic approach. The high percentage of positive blood cultures indicates the need to include lumbar puncture whenever systemic infection is suspected in the neonatal period.
TI  - The effect of temperature on bactericidal properties of 10% povidone-iodine solution.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ten percent povidone-iodine (PVI) is commonly used as a bactericidal solution before amniocentesis is performed. Warming PVI may increase patient comfort; however, the effect of warming on its bactericidal properties is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of warming 10% PVI on its bactericidal properties. STUDY DESIGN: Room temperature of PVI was 25 degrees C, and temperature in an ultrasonic gel warmer was 32 degrees C. In vitro experiments were conducted in 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C water baths. Nine milliliters of PVI at each temperature was added to 1 mL of bacteria (10(7) organisms/mL Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus). After 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 minutes, 1-mL samples were removed and added to 4 mL of 0.5% sodium thiosulfate (to neutralize the iodine and interrupt bactericidal action). The number of viable organisms was determined by plating 0.1-mL samples on trypticase soy agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. For in vivo experiments in 40 volunteers, a 9-cm2 area of the dorsum of each hand was wiped with a sterile cotton swab to obtain a sample of bacteria for culture. The area was then wiped for 15 seconds with PVI at 25 degrees C or 32 degrees C and recultured. The bactericidal properties of PVI at each temperature were compared. The Mann-Whitney U test was used as appropriate, and P <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In vitro, PVI was bactericidal against E coli, S aureus, Enterococcus species, and group B Streptococcus within 0.25 minutes at both 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, with median bacterial growth of 0 CFU/plate for each species of bacteria studied (3 replicates at each temperature). Median bacterial growth from skin was 4 CFU/plate (range, 0 to >100). After hands were wiped with PVI at 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C, median bacterial growth was 0 CFU/plate (range, 0-8) and 0 CFU/plate (range, 0-15), respectively (not significant). CONCLUSION: PVI is as effective at 32 degrees C as it is at 25 degrees C. Use of PVI at 32 degrees C should be considered to increase patient comfort in procedures performed without the use of anesthetics.
TI  - [Profile and sensitivity to antibiotics of 2063 uropathogenic bacteria isolated in the center of Tunisia].
AB  - Current bacteriological data are very useful when making therapeutic decisions in cases of non complicated urinary tract infection. In this article, we present the data gathered by a university hospital laboratory in mid-Tunisia as well as the results of 17,829 urinary cytobacteriological examinations conducted in a multidisciplinary hospital during the year 2000. Urine was sowed on usual agar. All bacterium cultivating at least 10(5) bacteria reported to ml and at 37 degrees C in a normal atmosphere was retained; identification and sensitivity to antibiotics of the bacterium followed the recommendations of the French Society of Microbiology. We collected 2063 non-redundant bacteria of which 82.3% came from female samples. Gram negative rods were distinctly predominant with 92% of the whole bacterium and Escherichia coli represented 67% of the whole of the germs; Staphylococcus saprophyticus with 4.8% and Streptococcus agalactiae with 1% dominated Gram positive bacteria. The susceptibility of bacteria to the principal antibiotics used for the treatment of the urinary tract infection was characterised by the low percentage of sensitivity of the Gram negative rods to amoxicillin (41.2% of sensitivity for Escherichia coli and 22% for the Proteus sp), and by cotrimoxazole which preserved an activity between 63.8% for Escherichia coli and 94.7% for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. The highest percentage of sensitivity was achieved by gentamicine (99.4% of Escherichia coli and 98.9% of Staphylococcus saprophyticus) and fluoroquinolons (97.8% of Escherichia coli and 100% of Staphylococcus saprophyticus are sensible); furadoin was active on almost all Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Apart from natural resistance, colistin was constantly active. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were the major agents of the urinary tract infection. Gentamicin and fluoroquinolons showed themselves to be constantly active antibiotics. Nitrofurans and colistin deserve a better place in therapeutic choice.
TI  - A glutamine transport gene, glnQ, is required for fibronectin adherence and virulence of group B streptococci.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. GBS adhere to fibronectin when it is attached to a solid phase. We isolated a Tn917 transposon mutant, COH1-GT1, which shows decreased adherence to fibronectin. COH1-GT1 also shows decreased adherence to and invasion of respiratory epithelial cells in vitro and decreased virulence in vivo. COH1-GT1 contains a Tn917 insertion in a homolog of glnQ, a gene from Escherichia coli which is required for glutamine transport and codes for a cytoplasmic ATP-binding cassette protein. To confirm that the decreased fibronectin adherence of COH1-GT1 was due to the mutation in glnQ, we constructed COH1-GT2, a strain with a nonpolar site-directed mutation in glnQ. COH1-GT2 showed decreased binding to fibronectin. We also demonstrated that complementation of glnQ in trans restored fibronectin adherence to COH1-GT1. COH1-GT1 shows decreased uptake of radiolabeled glutamine and is resistant to the toxic glutamine analog gamma-L-glutamylhydrazide, demonstrating that the glnQ gene is required for glutamine transport in GBS. glnQ lacks a signal sequence and is a cytoplasmic protein in E. coli and thus is unlikely to act as a fibronectin adhesin. glnQ is transcribed in an operon with a putative glutamine permease gene, glnP, which has a novel predicted structure containing three distinct domains linked in a single gene. The first two domains are putative glutamine binding domains with homology to the E. coli periplasmic glutamine binding gene glnH. The third is a putative permease domain with homology to the E. coli glutamine permease gene glnP. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that glnP and glnQ are contained within a single transcript. Transcription of scpB, encoding the only known fibronectin-binding adhesin of GBS, is unaffected. We speculate that glnQ may regulate expression of fibronectin adhesins by affecting cytoplasmic glutamine levels and that regulation may be posttranscriptional.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - [B Streptococcus and other pathogenic bacteria colonization in hospitals in the Gdansk Metro Area].
AB  - A survey of group B Streptococcus and other pathogenic bacteria colonization was  carried out on 658 neonates in 8 neonatal wards of hospitals in the Gdansk Metro Area and the district of Gdansk. Out of pathogenic bacteria Haemophilus and enteric bacteria the most frequently were isolated. The percentage of Staphylococcus aureus was relatively low (19.4). The group B Streptococcus frequency in throat was established as 3.8% and ranging from 1.7 to 8.8% in particular wards. In two cases group B streptococcus were not isolated. In probes taken from anus of newborn tested typical enteric flora dominated and E coli and Klebsiella sp were the most frequently encountered. Profile and frequency of bacterial colonization indicated that epidemiological situation in majority of particular wards in similar.
TI  - [Neonatal bacterial infection by maternal-fetal contamination: for a change in approach? 2. Uncertainties and proposals].
AB  - Based on a critical analysis of the literature, it is clear that even though mortality has decreased to 10-15%, the prevalence of neonatal bacterial infections remains dramatically stable. Precise risk factors can be identified in most cases of neonatal infection, but remain uncertain in many others: Streptococcus agalactiae is found in only 40% of the cases of sepsis; Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pneumococcus, and group A Streptococcus strains should also be considered for a real prophylactic strategy; context (prematurity), lack of a consensual attitude for intrapartum strategies; management schemes for asymptomatic neonates. Based on these observations, we make proposals for a realistic attitude for everyday practice based on risk factors, maternal and neonatal bacterial sampling procedures, and modalities for neonatal antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. SAMPLE: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. METHODS: Samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). RESULTS: Genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. Group B streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. Vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. Also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. CONCLUSION: Aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group B streptococci and E. coli. Its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. The most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. In theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a novel beta1,3-galactosyltransferase for capsular  polysaccharide synthesis by Streptococcus agalactiae type Ib.
AB  - A group B streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae type Ib, produces a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide consisting of the following pentasaccharide repeating unit: -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->. The type-specific capsular polysaccharide (CP) synthesis (cps) genes of this strain were cloned and analyzed. A cloned 10-kb DNA fragment contained cpsIbE to L and neu (neuraminic acid synthesis gene) B. Comparison of the gene products with those of S. agalactiae type Ia, which has a similar but distinct CP, showed that the translation products of cpsIa and cpsIb genes exhibited very high homology except for those of cpsJ and K. In the type Ia strain, cpsIaJ encodes beta1,4-galactosyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of galactose as the fourth monosaccharide of the sugar repeating unit. In the type Ib CP, this galactose forms a beta1,3-linkage to GlcNAc. The low homology between the type Ia and Ib CpsJs seems to reflect this difference. By enzymatic activity measurement, the cpsIbJ product was found to display beta1,3-galactosyltransferase activity. Furthermore, hydrophobic cluster analysis clarified the similarities and differences of the structures in N-terminal regions, including the DXD motif, between the galactosyltransferases.
TI  - Production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of human placental trophoblasts in response to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections. METHODS: Human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. After 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of cytokine mRNAs was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In nonstimulated cultures, low (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) and high (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. The pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, whereas TNF-alpha secretion was not elevated. E coli was the most potent inducer followed by B fragilis, S agalactiae, S aureus, and M hominis. Transcripts encoding IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, or IL-10 were elevated in the RT-PCR reactions, suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mRNA expression and polypeptide release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. Induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.
TI  - [Evolution of perinatal Escherichia coli disease in the era of group B Streptococcus prophylaxis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to characterize perinatal Escherichia coli  disease, and to analyze its possible correlation with the employment of prophylaxis for group B streptococcal (GBS)disease. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1994 and 2000, 24 neonates born in our hospital were diagnosed of early-onset E. coli disease: 12 born to mothers who received prenatal care in our center and 12 born to mothers who were referred from other hospitals shortly before labor. Three further neonates born in other centers were also referred with the same diagnosis. RESULTS: The annual rate did not change significantly (RR:1.065; confidence interval [CI] 95% -0.873-1.301; p = 0.533):from 0.6 per 1,000 live births in 1994 to 1.7 per 1,000 in 1997 and 0.5 in 2000. Among mothers, 92% presented obstetric risk factors including 68% with prematurity (mean 32.9 gestation weeks, median 32), 64% with prolonged rupture of membranes (mean 184 hours,median 44), and 56% with intrapartum fever. Twelve percent of mothers received intrapartum ampicillin as prophylaxis against GBS and 80% received antibiotics: prophylaxis for rupture of membranes in 6 cases, treatment of urinary tract infection in 6 cases and treatment of probable chorioamnionitis in 8 cases. Ampicillin-resistant E. coli was isolated in 81% of neonates. No significant correlation was found between ampicillin resistance and prematurity(p = 0.57), rupture of membranes (p = 0.63), intrapartum fever(p = 0.24) or death (p = 0.53). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that perinatal E. coli disease is not related with the employment of prophylaxis against GBS disease. Instead, it seems to be related with prematurity, prolonged gestation in premature rupture of membranes and exposure to antibiotics.
TI  - Early-onset neonatal sepsis in the era of group B streptococcal prevention.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease has resulted in an increased rate of non-GBS or antibiotic-resistant early-onset invasive neonatal disease. METHODS: Maternal and infant chart review of all infants with bacteria other than GBS isolated from blood or spinal fluid in 1996 through 1999 in 19 hospitals (representing 81% of in-state births to state residents) throughout Connecticut. Suspected cases were identified through clinical microbiology laboratory records or through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes when microbiology records were incomplete. RESULTS: Ninety-four cases of non-GBS early-onset sepsis or meningitis were detected between 1996 and 1999. The rate of GBS-related early-onset infection (days 0-6 of life) dropped from 0.61/1000 to 0.23/1000 births, but the annual rate of non-GBS sepsis remained steady, ranging from 0.65 to 0.68/1000 during the surveillance period. There was an increase in the proportion of Escherichia coli infections that were ampicillin resistant between 1996 and 1998, but the proportion decreased. in 1999 CONCLUSION: There was no increase in the incidence of non-GBS early-onset neonatal infections between 1996 and 1999. Fluctuations in the annual incidence of E coli infections, including ampicillin-resistant infections, suggest the need for continuation of surveillance in Connecticut and expansion to monitor larger populations.
TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - Effects of perfluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons/surfactant emulsions on growth and viability of group B streptococci and Escherichia coli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons (PFC) might be used as a new ventilatory strategy to treat respiratory insufficiency in congenital pneumonia. The present study investigates for the first time effects of PFC on growth and viability of group B streptococci (GBS) and Escherichia coli, bacteria frequently causing congenital pneumonia. DESIGN: Prospective, in vitro study. SETTING: Research laboratory in a university. MATERIAL: Group B streptococci 090 Ia HD Colindale and E. coli K12, JM 101. INTERVENTIONS: E. coli (10(7)/mL) were grown in the absence or presence of different PFC (RM 101, PF 5080, FO 6167) for up to 6 hrs. To study bacterial viability, GBS (5 x 10(7)/mL) were incubated in saline with or without different PFC, PFC/surfactant emulsions, or surfactant (Curosurf) for up to 5 hrs. Every 2 hrs, the colony forming units were determined by plating different dilutions of bacteria on agar. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: RM 101 or PF 5080 alone and in emulsions with surfactant had no effect on viability of GBS or growth of E. coli. For FO 6167, a previously described toxicity was found, even if 1 mL of GBS suspension was incubated with only 100 microL of FO 6167, verifying the experimental design that guarantees a PFC bacteria contact. The toxic effects were almost prevented by forming a PFC-in-surfactant emulsion but not by preincubation of GBS with surfactant and subsequent FO 6167 exposure. CONCLUSION: RM 101 and PF 5080 did not influence bacterial growth in vitro; direct effects on bacterial proliferation during partial liquid ventilation in congenital pneumonia seem, therefore, unlikely. Interestingly, we found that the known toxic effects of FO 6167 can be prevented by covering PFC with a surfactant film. Surfactant reduced the cytotoxic effects of FO 6167, probably by preventing a direct contact between FO 6167 and the bacterial cell wall.
TI  - Group B streptococcal disease: from trials and tribulations to triumph and trepidation.
AB  - Group B streptococci garnered attention during the 1970s when they surpassed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to become the principal causes of sepsis in early infancy. During the 1980s, several clinical trials demonstrated that administration of antimicrobial agents during labor could interrupt vertical transmission and prevent invasive disease in the first week of life (i.e., early-onset disease). However, prophylaxis was not widely used during the next 10 years. On the basis of efforts by clinician-researchers, professional organizations, community-based parent advocacy groups, and the public health community, consensus recommendations for group B streptococcal prophylaxis were finally issued in 1996. By the end of 1999, the incidence of early-onset disease in selected counties within the United States had decreased by 70%, and the gap between black and white persons with disease narrowed by 75%. This recent triumph leaves the professional community treading lightly, alert to the need to monitor for unintended consequences that may threaten recent progress.
TI  - Effective bactericidal activity of tobramycin and vancomycin eluted from acrylic  bone cement.
AB  - We studied the bioactivity of vancomycin and tobramycin eluted from methylmethacrylate bone cement. Aliquots of the drainage were obtained at 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours following total hip prosthetic implantation with vancomycin-tobramycin-loaded cement in 3 patients. The samples were analyzed with fluorescence polarization immunoassay and bioassay, using group B streptococcus for vancomycin and Escherichia coli for tobramycin. These bacteria were selected due to the effectiveness of vancomycin and poor effectiveness of tobramycin against group B streptococcus and conversely with E. coli. The immunodetection of vancomycin averaged 14 (1 hour), 9 (6 hours), 10 (12 hours) and 11 microg/mL (24 hours). The bioassay averaged 47, 36, 79 and 41 microg/mL (p = 0.03). The immunodetection of tobramycin averaged 43, 21, 18 and 14 microg/mL; and bioassay 30, 15, 15 and 12 microg/mL (p = 0.1). Both antibiotics eluted with a highly effective bactericidal activity. Our findings indicate that the presence of tobramycin has a synergistic-like effect on the bactericidal activity of vancomycin, which has not been previously reported. We recommend a combination of vancomycin and tobramycin with cement for the treatment of orthopedic infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Macrolide resistance gene mreA of Streptococcus agalactiae encodes a flavokinase.
AB  - The mreA gene from Streptococcus agalactiae COH31 gamma/delta, resistant to macrolides and clindamycin by active efflux, has recently been cloned in Escherichia coli, where it was reported to confer macrolide resistance (J. Clancy, F. Dib-Hajj, J. W. Petitpas, and W. Yuan, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 41:2719--2723, 1997). Cumulative data suggested that the mreA gene was located on the chromosome of S. agalactiae COH31 gamma/delta. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of mreA revealed significant homology with several bifunctional flavokinases/(flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) synthetases, which convert riboflavin to flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and FMN to FAD, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography experiments showed that the mreA gene product had a monofunctional flavokinase activity, similar to that of RibR from Bacillus subtilis. Sequences identical to those of the mreA gene and of a 121-bp upstream region containing a putative promoter were detected in strains of S. agalactiae UCN4, UCN5, and UCN6 susceptible to macrolides. mreA and its allele from S. agalactiae UCN4 were cloned on the shuttle vector pAT28. Both constructs were introduced into E. coli, where they conferred a similar two- to fourfold increase in the MICs of erythromycin, spiramycin, and clindamycin. The MICs of a variety of other molecules, including crystal violet, acriflavin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and antibiotics, such as certain cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and rifampin, were also increased. In contrast, resistance to these compounds was not detected when the constructs were introduced into E. faecalis JH2-2. In conclusion, the mreA gene was probably resident in S. agalactiae and may encode a metabolic function. We could not provide any evidence that it was responsible for macrolide resistance in S. agalactiae COH31 gamma/delta; broad-spectrum resistance conferred by the gene in E. coli could involve multidrug efflux pumps by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Development of a rapid and sensitive test for identification of major pathogens in bovine mastitis by PCR.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is the most important source of loss for the dairy industry. A rapid and specific test for the detection of the main pathogens of bovine mastitis is not actually available. Molecular probes reacting in PCR with bacterial DNA from bovine milk, providing direct and rapid detection of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, and Streptococcus uberis, have been developed. Two sets of specific primers were designed for each of these microorganisms and appeared to discriminate close phylogenic bacterial species (e.g., S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae). In addition, two sets of universal primers were designed to react as positive controls with all major pathogens of bovine mastitis. The sensitivities of the test using S. aureus DNA extracted from milk with and without a pre-PCR enzymatic lysis step of bacterial cells were compared. The detection limit of the assay was 3.125 x 10(2) CFU/ml of milk when S. aureus DNA was extracted with the pre-PCR enzymatic step compared to 5 x 10(3) CFU/ml of milk in the absence of the pre-PCR enzymatic step. This latter threshold of sensitivity is still compatible with its use as an efficient tool of diagnosis in bovine mastitis, allowing the elimination of expensive reagents. The two PCR tests avoid cumbersome and lengthy cultivation steps, can be performed within hours, and are sensitive, specific, and reliable for the direct detection in milk of the six most prevalent bacteria causing bovine mastitis.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Survey of yeast mastitis in dairy herds of small-type farms in the Lublin region, Poland.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to isolate fungi from the quarter milk of cow udders in 9 dairy farms. The samples were collected between May 1996 and April 2000 in the Lublin region. Six hundred and four milk samples collected from the quarters of 172 cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis were examined. Milk samples were plated as soon as possible on blood agar (BA), Mac Conkey agar, aesculin-tallium acetate-crystal violet blood agar, and Sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol and gentamicin. Fifty eight (9.6%) of the samples were positive for fungi. All of the fungal isolates were yeasts of the genera Candida, Rhodotorula and Trichosporon. We also isolated Streptococcus agalactiae (4.9%), Str. spp.(6.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci-CNS (36.6%), Escherichia coli (3.5%), other microorganisms (2.6%) and no growth (25.8%).
TI  - The major bovine mastitis pathogens have different cell tropisms in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells.
AB  - We previously showed that Staphylococcus aureus cells adhered mainly to an elongated cell type, present in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells. Moreover, we showed that this adhesion was mediated by binding to fibronectin. The same in vitro model was used here, to study adhesion of other important mastitis pathogens. Like the S. aureus strains, the Streptococcus dysgalactiae strains adhered mainly to elongated cells, which seemed to be mediated by fibronectin binding. In contrast, Streptococcus uberis strains adhered mainly to cubic cells. Since the cubic cells did not express fibronectin and S. uberis cells bound fibronectin less efficiently, the adhesion of S. uberis cells was independent of fibronectin binding. Streptococcus agalactiae strains adhered poorly to both cell types. The specificity and efficiency of adhesion of Escherichia coli strains was strongly strain dependent. None of the S. agalactiae and E. coli strains tested was able to bind fibronectin efficiently. The results suggest that the different mastitis pathogens have different target cell specificities and use different mechanisms to adhere to cells of the bovine mammary gland.
TI  - Intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. METHODS: A 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. One hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). Among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. These differed significantly from culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13 as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. GBS, MU urealyticum, and Streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, Bacteroides/Prevotella and S. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. The spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor at later gestations; however, GBS appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. CONCLUSIONS: Unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. GBS is a key pathogen in this setting.
TI  - Prevention of group B streptococcus early-onset neonatal sepsis: comparison of the Center for Disease Control and prevention screening-based protocol to a risk-based protocol in infants at greater than 37 weeks' gestation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the Center for Disease Control consensus guidelines' screening-based strategy to a risk-based strategy as regards the incidence of early-onset group B streptococcus (GBS) infection among term infants. STUDY DESIGN: A cohort of university hospital prenatal clinic mother-infant pairs who were screened for GBS at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation were compared to a matched control group of unscreened mother-infant pairs from the outreach satellite prenatal clinics who delivered at the same institution during the same time period. GBS screening was carried out with rectovaginal cultures plated on selective media. GBS-positive women received antimicrobial prophylaxis in labor whereas women of unknown GBS status were only treated intrapartum if they had a risk factor for GBS infection. Principal outcome variables included incidence of cases of neonatal early-onset GBS sepsis (blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid positive for GBS), incidence of cases of strongly suspected GBS sepsis (culture negative), and incidence of neonatal sepsis with non-GBS organisms. RESULTS: There were 3164 screened mother-infant pairs who were compared to 2684 unscreened pairs. The incidence of GBS carriage was 13.3%. A random sample of 420 screened women were compared to a matched sample of 407 women of unknown GBS carrier status for characterization of demographics and risk factors. No cases of documented GBS sepsis occurred in the infants of the screened women, but four cases occurred among the infants of the women who did not undergo screening (incidence 1.5/1000) (p = 0.04), only one of whom had a risk factor for GBS infection. Cases of suspected but culture negative sepsis were not more common in the screened population when compared to the unscreened. There was one case of Escherichia coli sepsis in an infant of a mother in the unscreened group. CONCLUSIONS: GBS screening at 35 to 37 weeks, with intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis of carriers, decreased the incidence of neonatal early-onset GBS sepsis and appears to have advantages over treatment based on risk factors alone in term infants.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. Chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. Likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Five strains of Hemolytic streptococci group B (GBS) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: Hemolytic streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Lactobacillus species. Bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. RESULTS: An inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. Consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). In experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. All strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group A, S. aureus and S. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse panel of bacteria
TI  - Characterization of the cryptic plasmid pSBO2 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid designated pSBO2 (3582 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. The pSBO2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (Cop), countertranscribed RNAs (ctRNAs), and a replication protein (Rep), which were similar to those from pMV158 and pLS1, which were isolated from S. agalactiae, and pWVO1, isolated from Lactococcus lactis. The putative single-strand origin (sso) of pSBO2 was similar to pER341 and pST1, which were isolated from S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmid designated pSBE2 was constructed to bind pECM184 vector and the DNA fragment containing sso, dso, Cop, ctRNAs, and Rep of pSBO2. When pSBE2 was introduced into S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. This plasmid, designated pSBE2A, was capable of transforming Escherichia coli and S. bovis strains 12-U-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, pSBE2A is an effective shuttle vector.
TI  - Genetic basis for the beta-haemolytic/cytolytic activity of group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) express a beta-haemolysin/cytolysin that contributes to disease pathogenesis. We report an independent discovery and extension of a genetic locus encoding the GBS beta-haemolysin/cytolysin activity. A plasmid library of GBS chromosomal DNA was cloned into Escherichia coli, and a transformant was identified as beta-haemolytic on blood agar. The purified plasmid contained a 4046 bp insert of GBS DNA encoding two complete open reading frames (ORFs). A partial upstream ORF (cylB) and the first complete ORF (cylE) represent the 3' end of a newly reported genetic locus (cyl) required for GBS haemolysin/cytolysin activity. ORF cylE is predicted to encode a 78.3 kDa protein without GenBank homologies. The GBS DNA fragment also includes a previously unreported ORF, cylF, with homology to bacterial aminomethyltransferases, and the 5' end of cylH, with homology to 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthases. Southern analysis demonstrated that the cyl locus was conserved among GBS of all common serotypes. Targeted plasmid integrational mutagenesis was used to disrupt cylB, cylE, cylF and cylH in three wild-type GBS strains representing serotypes Ia, III and V. Targeted integrations in cylB, cylF and cylH retaining wild-type haemolytic activity were identified in all strains. In contrast, targeted integrations in cylE were invariably non-haemolytic and non-cytolytic, a finding confirmed by in frame allelic exchange of the cylE gene. The haemolytic/cytolytic activity of the cylE allelic exchange mutants could be restored by reintroduction of cylE on a plasmid vector. Inducible expression of cylE, cylF and cylEF demonstrated that it is CylE that confers haemolytic activity in E. coli. We conclude that cylE probably represents the structural gene for the GBS haemolysin/cytolysin, a novel bacterial toxin.
TI  - Cloning and expression of gene fragment IgA-binding protein of group B streptococci.
AB  - Different fragments of the bac gene coding for the IgA-binding protein were cloned, sequenced and expressed in E. coli. Cloning was accomplished after amplification of different parts of the gene by PCR. The 1.5-kb fragment of the gene was cloned using plasmid pBluescript. This fragment coded for the 45-kDa protein with the stable expression of IgA binding. In order to verify the exact location of the IgA-binding domain two smaller plasmids were constructed. Both plasmids were prepared using pQE30 (31, 32) expression vectors from Qiagen. The plasmids carried 245 and 123 bp bac gene fragments encoding 14- and 7-kDa proteins. These proteins together with the 20-amino-acid oligopeptide ITNEDKDSMLKKIEDINRQA were tested for IgA binding. Only the 14-kDa protein was able to bind IgA. This protein was used for rabbit immunization and found to be immunogenic. The data obtained lead to the conclusion that there is a lower limit in the size of recombinant IgA-binding proteins that can be utilized for anti-GBS vaccination.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission: an epidemiological study from the "Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo".
AB  - A prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in Spain. The study was carried out by the "Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo" that included the neonatal services of 19 tertiary care (reference) hospitals and 9 secondary care hospitals. Prospective data from infants with culture-proved neonatal sepsis, clinical sepsis and bacteremia were recorded for 1995 to 1997. In a total of 203,288 neonates, proven sepsis was diagnosed in 515 (rate of 2.5 per 1000 live births), clinical sepsis in 724 (rate of 3.6 per 1000 live births), and bacteremia of vertical transmission in 155 (rate of 0.76 per 1000 live births). Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (< or = 1500 g) showed a significantly higher incidence of confirmed sepsis (26.5 per 1000 live births) and clinical sepsis (32.4 per 1000 live births) than infants weighing > 1500 g. Streptococcus agalactiae was the most frequent causative pathogen in cases of proven sepsis (51%) and bacteremia (33%), but Escherichia coli was the most frequently recovered organism in the VLBW group. The mortality rate of proven sepsis was significantly higher than that of clinical sepsis (8.7% versus 4.3%) (P < 0.01). In the VLBW cohort, there were no significant differences in the mortality rate between proven sepsis and clinical sepsis. In conclusion, clinical sepsis was the most frequent diagnosis, probably related to intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. Streptococcus agalactiae was the most frequent causative pathogen of culture-positive sepsis and bacteremia, whereas E. coli was the most significant in VLBW infants.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, S-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  - Carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. S-4661, a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase I. We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-4661 against strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of S-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/L, respectively. The in vivo efficacy of S-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by E. coli and B. fragilis. The accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the S-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. These results suggest that S-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.
TI  - Influence of modified natural or synthetic surfactant preparations on growth of bacteria causing infections in the neonatal period.
AB  - Connatal bacterial pneumonia is common in neonates. Animal studies and initial clinical reports indicate that surfactant dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of severe neonatal pneumonia. Since respiratory distress syndrome and connatal pneumonia may be difficult to differentiate in the first hours of life, neonates with respiratory failure due to bacterial infections might receive surfactant. Under such conditions surfactant components might be catabolized by bacteria and promote bacterial growth. We therefore investigated the influence of three modified natural (Curosurf, Alveofact, and Survanta) and two synthetic (Exosurf and Pumactant) surfactant preparations on the growth of bacteria frequently cultured from blood or tracheal aspirate fluid in the first days of life. Group B streptococci (GBS), Staphyloccocus aureus, and Escherichia coli were incubated in a nutrient-free medium (normal saline) for 5 h at 37 degrees C, together with different surfactants at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 20 mg/ml. With the exception of E. coli, incubation in saline alone led to a variable decrease in CFU. In the presence of Alveofact, Exosurf, and Pumactant the decline in bacterial numbers was less marked than in saline alone. Curosurf was bactericidal in a dose-dependent fashion for GBS and had a strong negative impact on the growth of a GBS subtype that lacked the polysaccharide capsule. In contrast, Survanta (10 and 20 mg/ml) significantly promoted the growth of E. coli, indicating that surfactant components may actually serve as nutrients. We conclude that bacterial growth in different surfactant preparations is influenced by microbial species and the composition and dose of the surfactant. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind our findings and to evaluate the effects of surfactant on bacterial growth in vivo.
TI  - NeuD plays a role in the synthesis of sialic acid in Escherichia coli K1.
AB  - The polysialic acid capsule of Escherichia coli K1 is an essential virulence determinant. The kps gene cluster, which encodes the proteins necessary for polymer synthesis and transport, is divided into three functional regions. In this report, we present evidence that the neuD gene from region 2 is involved in sialic acid synthesis. A non-polar chromosomal deletion in neuD was constructed. The defect was complemented by neuD in trans or by the addition of exogenous sialic acid. A NeuD homologue, Neu(III)D, from serotype III Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) also restored capsule expression to the neuD deletion strain. These data confirm the role of neuD in E. coli sialic acid capsule synthesis and demonstrate that the neu(III)D homologue from GBS shares a similar enzymatic function.
TI  - The serotype of type Ia and III group B streptococci is determined by the polymerase gene within the polycistronic capsule operon.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a primary cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.  Essential to the virulence of this pathogen is the production of a type-specific capsular polysaccharide (CPS) that enables the bacteria to evade host immune defenses. The identification, cloning, sequencing, and functional characterization of seven genes involved in type III capsule production have been previously reported. Here, we describe the cloning and sequencing of nine additional adjacent genes, cps(III)FGHIJKL, neu(III)B, and neu(III)C. Sequence comparisons suggested that these genes are involved in sialic acid synthesis, pentasaccharide repeating unit formation, and oligosaccharide transport and polymerization. The type III CPS (cpsIII) locus was comprised of 16 genes within 15.5 kb of contiguous chromosomal DNA. Primer extension analysis and investigation of mRNA from mutants with polar insertions in their cpsIII loci supported the hypothesis that the operon is transcribed as a single polycistronic message. The translated cpsIII sequences were compared to those of the S. agalactiae cpsIa locus, and the primary difference between the operons was found to reside in cps(III)H, the putative CPS polymerase gene. Expression of cps(III)H in a type Ia strain resulted in suppression of CPS Ia synthesis and in production of a CPS which reacted with type III-specific polyclonal antibody. Likewise, expression of the putative type Ia polymerase gene in a type III strain reduced synthesis of type III CPS with production of a type Ia immunoreactive capsule. Based on the similar structures of the oligosaccharide repeating units of the type Ia and III capsules, our observations demonstrated that cps(Ia)H and cps(III)H encoded the type Ia and III CPS polymerases, respectively. Additionally, these findings suggested that a single gene can confer serotype specificity in organisms that produce complex polysaccharides.
TI  - Investigation of the translation-initiation factor IF2 gene, infB, as a tool to study the population structure of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The sequence of infB, encoding the prokaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 (IF2), was determined in eight strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) and an alignment revealed limited intraspecies diversity within S. agalactiae. The amino acid sequence of IF2 from S. agalactiae and from related species were aligned and revealed an interspecies conserved central and C-terminal part, and an N-terminal part that is highly variable in length and amino acid sequence. The diversity and relationships in a collection of 58 genetically distinct strains of S. agalactiae were evaluated by comparing a partial sequence of infB. A total of six alleles were detected for the region of infB analysed. The alleles correlated with the separation of the same strains of S. agalactiae into major evolutionary lineages, as shown in previous work. The partial sequences of infB were furthermore used in phylogenetic analyses of species closely related to S. agalactiae, yielding an evolutionary tree which had a topology similar to a tree constructed using 16S rRNA sequences from the same species.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1994 and 1998].
AB  - We evaluated 82 children with bacterial meningitis in 78 institutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1994 and 1998. The mean number of cases per year was 16.4 (range, 9 to 30). A male predominance occurred with 52 males and 30 females (1.7:1). Median age was 11 months with a range from 1 day to 11 years. Seventy-eight (95%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 55 (67%) less than 2 years old and 45 (55%) less than 1-year old. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case fatality rate of 4.9%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 29%, predominantly sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy and development delay of varying severity. The main causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae in 49 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 14, Streptococcus agalactiae in 10 and Escherichia coli in 5. The frequency of poor prognosis was 50% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae or S. agalactiae compared with 27% for patients with meningitis due to H. influenzae.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. CD14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including LPS. However, little is known of monocyte receptors involved in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. To identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mAbs and TNF-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. Human serum and anti-CD14 Abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, TNF-alpha responses to the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. However, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including group A and B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Complement receptor type III (CR3 or CD18/CD11b) Abs prevented TNF-alpha release induced by heat-killed group A or B streptococci. In contrast, the same Abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus. Using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of TNF-alpha release was produced by Abs to CD11c, one of the subunits of CR4. To confirm these blocking Ab data, IL-6 release was measured in CR3-, CR4-, or CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. Accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate IL-6 production (p < 0.05) in CR3 but not CD14 or CR4 transfectants. In contrast, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus induced IL-6 release in CR4 but not CR3 or CD14 transfectants. Collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as CR3 and CR4, may be involved in cytokine responses to Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, CD14 may play a more important role in responses to whole Gram-negative bacteria relative to Gram-positive ones.
TI  - Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by human monocytes exposed to group B streptococci.
AB  - Group B streptococcal (GBS) infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The molecular pathways mediating the pathophysiological events in GBS infection are not fully delineated. Cyclooxygenases (COX) are the enzymes that convert arachidonate to active eicosanoids. To identify the effects of GBS on eicosanoid metabolism and regulatory mechanisms, we exposed human monocytes to GBS and found that they secreted prostaglandin E2, prostacyclin, and thromboxane A2. Exposure to GBS caused monocytes to express COX-2 mRNA and protein in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner that correlated with eicosanoid production. COX-1 protein was unchanged. Addition of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-10 markedly attenuated GBS-induced COX-2 protein accumulation after GBS exposure, as did inhibition of p38 MAPK. Our experiments are the first to show that exposure of monocytes to a gram-positive bacterium (GBS) results in induction of functional COX-2, suggesting that eicosanoids may play important roles in the pathogenesis of GBS infections.
TI  - Frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious complications in severe pancreatitis are the main factors  determining clinical course and outcome. The taurocholate model for acute necrotizing pancreatitis was evaluated for frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection. METHODS: Sixty-five male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups of 13 animals each. Specimens for bacteriologic examination were taken, and pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of 3% taurocholate under sterile conditions. Animals were killed 8, 16, 24, or 32 hours thereafter, and bacteriologic examination was performed. A control group of animals with intraductal infusion of 0.9% saline solution were killed after 32 hours. RESULTS: There was no significant pancreatic infection in the control group and in the 8-hour group (1 of 13 rats). Sixteen and 24 hours after induction of pancreatitis, infection and inflammation of the pancreas were found in 77% (10 of 13 rats), and after 32 hours pancreatic infection occurred in 69% (9 of 13 rats). Extrapancreatic bacterial infection after 16 hours occurred in the liver (62%), spleen (62%), and mesenteric lymph nodes (46%). Bacteria infecting the pancreas reflected the bacterial spectrum of the large bowel and terminal ileum before induction of pancreatitis (Escherichia coli [77%], Proteus [43%], Enterococcus [37%], and Staphylococcus [23%]). CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic infection is an early and frequent finding in the taurocholate model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Infection occurs between 8 and 16 hours after induction of pancreatitis. The source of infecting bacteria seems to be the large bowel or the terminal ileum. We present a useful model of severe pancreatitis in which to study bacterial translocation, the further route of spread, and therapeutic approaches.
TI  - [Acquired antibiotic resistance in Madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in Madagascar. Testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar in Antananarivo between October 1997 and October 1998. Antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. Results were read according to the criteria of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology. Preliminary findings documented a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin G and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of Staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which 80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of Escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of Shigella sp. respectively were resistant. Second-line antibiotics including penicillin M, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an effective alternative. Newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. Although not representative of Madagascar as a whole, the findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Readmission for group B streptococci or Escherichia coli infection among full-term, singleton, vaginally delivered neonates after early discharge from Florida hospitals for births from 1992 through 1994.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Florida during the period 1992 through 1994, there was a major drop in the length of stay for full-term, singleton, vaginally delivered newborn babies in the hospital. A major concern on the part of clinicians has been the potential of an increased risk of sepsis (manifesting itself after discharge) associated with earlier newborn discharge from the hospital. We used the Florida hospital discharge dataset to study the frequency of readmission with sepsis after early newborn discharge to home. METHODS: Using the Florida Agency for Health-Care Administration Acute Care Hospital Discharge Dataset, we used a multivariate, probabilistic matching algorithm to merge newborn discharge records for births from 1992 through 1994 with readmission discharge records (including hospital-to-hospital transfers and multiple readmissions) during the first 28 days of life. We used the resulting merged dataset to study bacterial infection diagnoses on newborn and readmission records and to examine relationships between readmission diagnoses and timing of newborn discharge among the 364,528 full-term, singleton, vaginally delivered babies (FTSVDBs) without congenital anomalies from 1992 through 1994 in Florida acute-care hospitals. RESULTS: Overall, 86.3% of all FTSVDBs born in Florida acute-care hospitals were discharged between day of life (DOL) 0 (born and discharged the same day) and DOL 2 (discharged two calendar days after birth). The group B streptococci (GBS) infection code was found on the newborn discharge records of 9.2 per 10,000 FTSVDBs over the 3-year period, 5.9% of which involved hospital-to-hospital transfer of the baby. Escherichia coli infection codes were found on the records of 3.4 per 10,000 FTSVDBs over the 3-year period, 2.3% of which involved hospital-to-hospital transfer of the baby. Of those FTSVDBs discharged to home without infection codes during DOL 1 to 2, 0.8 per 10,000 were readmitted within 7 days (inclusive) with GBS infection, and 2.0 per 10,000 with E. coli infection. When the data for readmitted babies were pooled for 1992 through 1994, the odds ratio for probability of readmission comparing discharges on DOL 1 to DOL 2 for GBS was 2.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.83 to 2.70), and for E. coli 2.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.46 to 2.85). Over this 3-year period, for babies discharged on DOL 1, there was a 115% increase in the rate of readmission for GBS from 1992 through 1994 (p < 0.01) and a 36.5% increase in the rate of readmission for E. coli (p < 0.05). However, among FTSVDBs discharged on DOL 2, the rate of readmission for both GBS and E. coli did not change during the period 1992 through 1994. There were no deaths among FTSVDBs as either newborns, transfers, or readmissions within 7 days of discharge, with either GBS or E. coli infection codes on their discharge record. CONCLUSION: From 1992 through 1994, the increased number of babies discharged early in Florida was temporally associated with an increased rate of readmission during the week after discharge for both GBS and E. coli infection among babies discharged on the calendar day after birth. With an increase in both the number of babies exposed to the risks of early discharge, and an increased rate of these serious infections during the week after discharge from the hospital, the number of these babies grew to exceed, by several fold, the number of babies with inborn errors of metabolism picked up by state screening programs.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - Biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase I. Biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. The MIC(90) of biapenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. The in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. The accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. These results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  - From 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.
TI  - Risk factors and opportunities for prevention of early-onset neonatal sepsis: a multicenter case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) prevention efforts are based  on targeted use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP); applicability of these prevention efforts to infections caused by other organisms is not clear. METHODS: Multicenter surveillance during 1995 to 1996 for culture-confirmed, early-onset sepsis in an aggregate of 52 406 births; matched case-control study of risk factors for GBS and other sepsis. RESULTS: Early-onset disease occurred in 188 infants (3.5 cases per 1000 live births). GBS (1.4 cases per 1000 births) and Escherichia coli (0.6 cases per 1000 births) caused most infections. GBS sepsis less often occurred in preterm deliveries compared with other sepsis. Compared with gestation-matched controls without documented sepsis, GBS disease was associated with intrapartum fever (matched OR, 4.1; CI, 1.2-13.4) and frequent vaginal exams (matched OR, 2.9; CI, 1.1-8. 0). An obstetric risk factor-preterm delivery, intrapartum fever, or membrane rupture >/=18 hours-was found in 49% of GBS cases and 79% of other sepsis. IAP had an adjusted efficacy of 68.2% against any early-onset sepsis. Ampicillin resistance was evident in 69% of E coli infections. No deaths occurred among susceptible E coli infections, whereas 41% of ampicillin-resistant E coli infections were fatal. Ninety-one percent of infants who developed ampicillin-resistant E coli infections were preterm, and 59% of these infants were born to mothers who had received IAP. CONCLUSIONS: Either prenatal GBS screening or a risk-based strategy could potentially prevent a substantial portion of GBS cases. Sepsis caused by other organisms is more often a disease of prematurity. IAP seemed efficacious against early-onset sepsis. However, the severity of ampicillin-resistant E coli sepsis and its occurrence after maternal antibiotics suggest caution regarding use of ampicillin instead of penicillin for GBS prophylaxis.
TI  - Intracellular and extracellular cytokine production by human mixed mononuclear cells in response to group B streptococci.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are a major cause of severe infection in newborns, pregnant females, and other immunocompromised hosts. Infection often includes septicemia, shock, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. In previous studies, we have reported that GBS induce marked production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by human mononuclear cells. The present study was designed to measure the production of TNF-alpha as well as additional cytokines, including interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) but also to determine from what cells and at what time point during incubation with GBS that these cytokines are produced. Mixed mononuclear cells were incubated with heat-killed GBS, media alone, or 1 microg of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Brefeldin A was added to each sample prior to staining, which prevented the export of cytokines by the Golgi apparatus. The cells were then stained with the appropriate conjugated antibodies and analyzed by using a flow cytometer. Results indicate that intracellular cytokines appear, in almost all cases, simultaneous to or before secreted proteins are detected. In contrast to the response to LPS, where TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 appear almost simultaneously, the human monocyte response to GBS results in the production of TNF-alpha but delayed appearance of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8. The lymphocyte response to GBS was also strikingly different from that to LPS in that both secreted IFN-gamma and IL-12 was detected, while LPS failed to induce production of these critical cytokines. This suggests an important role for TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-12 in GBS pathogenesis and/or immunity.
TI  - Risk factors associated with early-onset sepsis in premature infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.004-8.56), Apgar score after 1 min (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.36-12.12). There was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.07-17.40). Funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. The histological examination of the umbilical cord can be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.
TI  - An Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector as a tool for the construction of a group B Streptococcus heterologous mutant expressing the beta antigen (Bac) of the C protein complex.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) represent a very important group of human pathogens. So far little is known about the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause disease and the bacterial factors involved. One putative virulence factor is the beta antigen of the C protein complex (Bac), which can bind to the Fc region of human IgA. Its binding function might represent an important virulence mechanism. However, the genetic manipulation of this group of bacteria, necessary to prove involvement of bacterial factors in pathogenesis, is still in its infancy. We therefore tested the pAM401 vector system for its suitability in the construction of a heterologous expression mutant using the Bac protein as a model antigen. The bac gene, including its own promoter, was cloned into the Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pAM401 and was stably maintained extrachromosomally in the bac-deficient GBS strain 335. Expression of Bac was assessed by extracting the protein from transformed 335(pPJTU1) cells, negative controls (335 wild-type, 335(pAM401)) and other Bac-expressing GBS strains (A909, LA239). Blots of the extracted proteins probed with IgA, polyclonal sera and a monoclonal antibody raised against Bac clearly revealed expression of the 130-kDa protein in the transformed GBS 335(pPJTU1) cells. The correct processing and surface anchoring of the expressed Bac was demonstrated by binding of (125)I-labelled IgA to whole cells. Strain 335(pPJTU1) bound 12 times as much IgA compared to the parental strain LA239 and the GBS 335 negative controls, and a total of 25% compared to the high-level-expressing strain A909. Our studies show that the pAM401 shuttle vector can be used for stable heterologous expression of surface proteins in GBS. Our strategy is also of major importance for the complementation of deletion mutants in GBS and other Gram-positive human pathogens to fulfill Koch's postulates. The Bac mutant constructed in this study, 335(pPJTU1), can be used in animal models to assess the importance of Bac in GBS pathogenesis.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Semiquantitative bacterial observations with group B streptococcal vulvovaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Group B streptococcal (GBS) vulvovaginitis is a poorly-delineated clinical entity. The purpose of this study is to report semiquantitative data from four cases of GBS vulvovaginitis and to comment on their significance in terms of the in vitro inhibitory capabilities of GBS. METHODOLOGY: Four patients whose clinical presentations were consistent with GBS vulvovaginitis, from whom GBS was isolated and for whom semi-quantitative as well as qualitative microbiologic data existed, were identified. RESULTS: To produce vulvovaginitis, GBS must be at a high multiplicity (10(8) CFU/g of vaginal fluid). Single coisolates were identified in three of the four cases (two cases of Escherichia coli and one case of Staphylococcus aureus). Group B streptococcus does not inhibit either of these bacteria in vitro. CONCLUSION: When the growth requirements for the demonstration of in vitro inhibition for GBS or lack thereof are met in vivo, the in vivo observations are consistent with those projected from the in vitro data.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Characterization of Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying Streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  - We have identified and characterized an Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (AP, encoded by phoZ). The predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from Bacillus subtilis. Expression of phoZ in Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), or Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (XP or BCIP). Two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. First, elimination of the signal sequence reduced AP activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. Restoration of export, using the signal sequence from C5a peptidase, restored AP activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. Second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which AP was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). In E. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher AP activity than the cytoplasmic fusion. We concluded that AP activity is export dependent. The signal sequence deletion mutant, phoZDeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from GBS that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. Included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the Rib protein (a cell wall protein from GBS) or with DppB (an integral membrane protein from GAS). AP acts as a reporter enzyme in GBS, GAS, and E. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Molecular characterization of type-specific capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis  genes of Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia.
AB  - The type-specific capsular polysaccharide (CP) of a group B streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia, is a high-molecular-weight polymer consisting of the pentasaccharide repeating unit 4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1- ->3 )]-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1. Here, cloning, sequencing, and transcription of the type Ia-specific capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) genes and functional analysis of these gene products are described. A 26-kb DNA fragment containing 18 complete open reading frames (ORFs) was cloned. These ORFs were designated cpsIaA to cpsIaL, neu (neuraminic acid synthesis gene) A to D, orf1 and ung (uracil DNA glycosylase). The cps gene products of S. agalactiae type Ia were homologous to proteins involved in CP synthesis of S. agalactiae type III and S. pneumoniae serotype 14. Unlike the cps gene cluster of S. pneumoniae serotype 14, transcription of this operon may start from cpsIaA, cpsIaE, and orf1 because putative promoter sequences were found in front of these genes. Northern hybridization, reverse transcription-PCR, and primer extension analyses supported this hypothesis. DNA sequence analysis showed that there were two transcriptional terminators in the 3' end of this operon (downstream of orf1 and ung). The functions of CpsIaE, CpsIaG, CpsIaI, and CpsIaJ were examined by glycosyltransferase assay by using the gene products expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 harboring plasmids containing various S. agalactiae type Ia cps gene fragments. Enzyme assays suggested that the gene products of cpsIaE, cpsIaG, cpsIaI, and cpsIaJ are putative glucosyltransferase, beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase, beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, respectively.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and expression of the CAMP factor gene (cfa) of group A  streptococci.
AB  - The CAMP reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (CAMP factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C (beta-toxin). Group A streptococci (GAS [Streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered CAMP negative, and this reaction commonly has been used to distinguish GAS from Streptococcus agalactiae. We here provide evidence that GAS possess this gene and produce an extracellular CAMP factor capable of participating in a positive CAMP reaction. The S. pyogenes CAMP factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the CAMP factor genes from S. agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. This gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in Escherichia coli. Recombinant clones of E. coli expressing cfa secreted an active CAMP factor. The deduced 28.5-kDa protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. The cfa gene is widely spread among GAS: 82 of 100 clinical GAS isolates produced a positive CAMP reaction. Of the CAMP-negative strains, 17 of the 18 GAS strains contained the cfa gene. Additionally, CAMP activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups C, M, P, R, and U. The cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in Escherichia coli and gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) under control of the cfa promoter. These cfa promoter-lacZ fusions were introduced into S. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. The results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the CAMP factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups A, B, C, G, M, P, R, and U.
TI  - [Trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  - Presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (LGT) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. It is currently accepted that infections of the LGT are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. This means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. Lactobacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with Streptococcus (aerobe), Streptococcus agalactiae and others like Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides sp., Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Fusobacterium, Escherichia coli. Different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). They are discussed in different sections. Trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to Chlamydia with excellent clinical results and a good tolerance. It was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. New fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. The use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in the newborn: a prospective study of mortality and morbidity.
AB  - Neonatal bacterial meningitis is a serious disease around the world, with the incidence changing little in the past 30 years. Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae are common causative organisms and lumbar puncture remains the definitive method of diagnosis. The mortality rate has declined in industrialized countries over the years, from almost 50% in the 1970s to less than 10% in 1997. However, neurological sequelae are still frequently observed despite major changes in treatment. Preliminary analysis of our own data from a prospective study of cases in the United Kingdom suggests that treatment with third generation cephalosporins is related to a decrease in mortality but not morbidity.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Udder health on dairy farms. 1. Results of a longitudinal study on 300 Dutch farms].
AB  - Udder health was studied in 300 dairy herds grouped in three categories according to the bulk milk somatic cell count. In all herds, lactating cows were housed in a free-stall barn during the winter. All herds participated in a three or four-weekly milk recording system, had annual production quota between 300,000 and 900,000 kg, and were stocked with cows of the Holstein-Friesian or Dutch Friesian breeds. The incidence of clinical mastitis was not different among herds with a low (< or = 150,000), middle (151,000 to 250,000), or high (251,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, or Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count; however, the incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was not different among the three herd categories. The differences in bulk milk somatic cell count between the categories could be explained by the management practices studied. The incidence of clinical E. coli mastitis was mostly related to housing, hygiene, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with factors that were related to the bulk milk somatic cell count and to factors of which it was not clear whether they were a cause or effect of the high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis was related to nutrition, milking technique, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was associated with housing, nutrition, and milking machine. Two groups of farmers and herds could be differentiated. The first group was identified as 'Clean and Accurate', and the second group as 'Quick and Dirty'. The relationship between these two groups and bulk milk somatic cell count category was high. However, the relationship between the two groups and the incidence of clinical mastitis was weak.
TI  - In vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - T-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Pazufloxacin (T-3761) is an active form of T-3762. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for Prevotella bivia. The MICs of T-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for S. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for G. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for E. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for P. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for B. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for P. bivia. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, T-3762, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Evaluation of an extended diagnostic PCR assay for detection and verification of  the common causes of bacterial meningitis in CSF and other biological samples.
AB  - A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assay was evaluated for detection and verification of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Steptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other biological samples. A general bacterial amplicon from the 16S rRNA gene was amplified in a first step, and species-specific regions in a second. The detection level was 4 fg DNA/reaction, corresponding to about one bacterial genome per reaction tube. Sample preparations (Dynabeads DNA DIRECT kit) were assayed from 140 bacterial strains suspended in saline. In CSF the detection level for bacteria was 10(3)CFU ml-1for N. meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, 10(4)CFU ml-1for Escherichia coli and 10(5)CFU ml-1for S. agalactiae and L. monocytogenes. The detection levels for these bacteria were the same in the other tested biological samples, like blood with or without culture media. Clinical CSF samples were evaluated from 71 patients with proven bacterial meningitis, as were 61 CSF samples from individuals without bacterial meningitis. The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay in detecting bacteria in general was 0.97, and for the specific species in the clinical CSF samples 0.87-0.94. The specificity was 1.0 for detecting bacteria in general. Some cross-reactions were noted within the streptococcus group. The PCR results were verified by banding patterns of Hae III digested PCR products.
TI  - Lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant by bacteria.
AB  - The epithelium of the lung is lined with extracellular pulmonary surfactant. This is the surface that invading bacteria first come into contact with when they enter the alveoli. As bacteria become established and interact with this layer, various characteristics of surfactant may become altered. We studied free radical production by three bacterial species, group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the effect of two concentrations of lung surfactant (Curosurf at 0.04 and 0.4 mg/ml) on this production estimated by the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction test. We also measured the lipid peroxidation of surfactant at various incubation times (0-20 h), using a LPO-586 test kit. In addition, the effect of vitamin E as an antioxidant in a concentration of 0.5 microM was determined by the lipid peroxidation test. We found that the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction by the three bacterial species and lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant increased with time. Vitamin E reduced the lipid peroxidation of this surfactant. By measuring bacterial growth at various incubation times we showed that lung surfactant was bactericidal to group B streptococcal and E. coli strains and that P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to surfactant. We conclude that bacteria, probably by their production of reactive oxygen species, cause lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  - In adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae. In rare cases the cause of infection may also be Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. METHOD OF THE STUDY: We isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. Urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by Uricult test. The samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. Identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious API-20E (bioMerieux) was used. Bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on Muller-Hinton agars. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, Escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. Klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. Proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). DISCUSSION: It may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. Of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. However, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by Escherichia coli. Natural resistance to ampicillin of Klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. Proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. Contrary to Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus and Providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. Due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. The wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. A fall in the sensitivity of Klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant Klebsiella species. The sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). The most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
TI  - Lmb, a protein with similarities to the LraI adhesin family, mediates attachment  of Streptococcus agalactiae to human laminin.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Adherence to extracellular matrix proteins is considered an important factor in the pathogenesis of infection, but the genetic determinants of this process remain largely unknown. We identified and sequenced a gene which codes for a putative lipoprotein that exhibits significant homology to the streptococcal LraI protein family. Mutants of this locus were demonstrated to have substantially reduced adherence to immobilized human laminin. The nucleotide sequence of the gene was subsequently designated lmb (laminin binding) and shown to be present in all of the common serotypes of S. agalactiae. To determine the role of Lmb in the adhesion of S. agalactiae wild-type strains to laminin, a recombinant Lmb protein harboring six consecutive histidine residues at the C terminus was cloned, expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli. Preincubation of immobilized laminin with recombinant Lmb significantly reduced adherence of the wild-type strain O90R to laminin. These results indicate that Lmb mediates the attachment of S. agalactiae to human laminin, which may be essential for the bacterial colonization of damaged epithelium and translocation of bacteria into the bloodstream.
TI  - Vaccines and diagnostic methods for bovine mastitis: fact and fiction.
AB  - A number of problems are uniquely associated with vaccination of dairy cows for mastitis. One of these is that the number of mastitis pathogens is numerous and heterogeneous. Vaccine efforts have concentrated mainly on the major mastitis pathogens. While at least one S. aureus bacterin has been commercially available for a number of years, no large-scale, independent field trials have been published in refereed journals which support the efficacy of this vaccine. Experimental vaccines for S. aureus composed of pseudocapsule-enriched bacterins supplemented with alpha- and/or beta-toxoids appear promising, but none of these has been commercialized. With S. uberis, some protection against homologous strain challenges was reported recently with a live strain and a bacterin, but other data from the same laboratory showed this vaccine would not protect against heterologous challenge strains. At this time there is only one highly effective vaccine for mastitis, the core-antigen vaccine for coliform mastitis. All of the commercially available vaccines for this indication are bacterins of rough mutants of E. coli strain J5 or Salmonella spp. Preliminary success with an experimental vaccine based on the plasminogen activator of S. uberis is a very different approach for a mastitis vaccine. Little success has been reported with vaccination against other mastitis pathogens. For diagnostic methods, the high somatic cell count, as measured by direct count or indirect assays, remains the cornerstone of mastitis diagnosis. However, for subclinical mastitis, bacterial cell culture is a reliable diagnostic method. Pathogen identification may rely on older biochemical testing methods or newer commercial identification systems, depending on the laboratory budget. ELISA assays also have been used to assess herd infection status. Epidemiologic studies have used DNA fingerprinting and ribotyping, but none of these methods has yet produced an easily utilized commercial format. Within the next decade, additional efficacious vaccines for several of the most common agents for bovine mastitis are likely. A review written at that time then can be more fact than fiction.
TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - Measurement of antibacterial activities of T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  A, aflatoxin B1 and fumonisin B1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  - Various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. Ten different strains of the genera Escherichia, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Yersinia, Salmonella, Erysipelothrix and Lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), ochratoxin A (OTA), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) were used as representative mycotoxins. The inhibitory effect in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. Among the tested strains, Streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of OTA. T-2 toxin and FB1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. AFB1 affected the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica. The growth rate of Escherichia coli and Salmonella infantis was decreased by FB1. Among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by OTA. Thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. We concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.
TI  - Effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (NO) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. We studied the antimicrobial properties of NO in concentrations used with inhaled NO therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates. DESIGN: In vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without NO exposure. SETTING: Level IV neonatal intensive care unit at a university children's hospital. SUBJECTS: In vitro bacterial cultures. INTERVENTIONS: We tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococcus [GBS/Streptococcus agalactiae], Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. Cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of NO (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. After incubation (with or without NO), colony-forming units were counted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bacterial growth of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was not reduced with the NO concentrations applied. The number of colony-forming units of S. aureus increased at 80 ppm of NO. Growth of S. epidermidis and GBS was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with controls exposed to ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NO has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. This effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled NO therapy. However, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled NO in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of NO is not to be expected.
TI  - Potential consequences of widespread antepartal use of ampicillin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recommendations for the use of antenatal antibiotics in obstetrics have increased in the past few years, especially for prophylaxis against group B streptococci, for prolongation of the latency time in patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes, and as an adjuvant treatment in preterm labor. Our objective was to determine whether the use of antenatal ampicillin affects the incidence of and resistance of early-onset neonatal sepsis with organisms other than group B streptococci. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was performed between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1996. Every case of blood culture-proven neonatal sepsis was prospectively surveyed. The type of bacteria isolated, drug resistance, antenatal antibiotic use and treatment indication, gestational age at delivery, and other antenatal and outcome variables were gathered. Early-onset neonatal sepsis was defined as disease onset within 7 days after birth. RESULTS: A total of 42 cases of early-onset neonatal sepsis among 29,897 neonates delivered were found during the 6-year period. Of these, 15 cases were due to group B streptococci and 27 were the result of non-group B streptococcal organisms (21 gram-negative rods and 6 gram-positive cocci). Among the 27 non-group B streptococcal cases, 15 mothers had received antenatal ampicillin and 13 of the 15 bacterial isolates from these neonates (87%) were resistant to ampicillin, versus only 2 ampicillin-resistant isolates (17%) among the 12 cases in which no antenatal antibiotics were administered (P = .0004). Of the 15 mothers who were treated with ampicillin, 13 received more than 1 dose. In evaluating each year of the study, the overall administration of antibiotics to pregnant women in the antenatal period increased from <10% in 1991 to 16.9% in 1996. The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis with group B streptococci decreased during this time, whereas the incidence of early-onset sepsis with non-group B streptococcal organisms, especially Escherichia coli, increased. CONCLUSIONS: The increased administration of antenatal ampicillin to pregnant women may be responsible for the increased incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis with non-group B streptococcal organisms that are resistant to ampicillin. At this time penicillin G, rather than ampicillin, is therefore recommended for prophylaxis against group B streptococci. In addition, future studies are needed to determine whether alternate approaches, such as immunotherapy or vaginal washing, could be of benefit.
TI  - Effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. The strains used in this study included Escherichia coli (FT 101), Streptococcus agalactiae (FT 311, FT 313, FT 315), Staphylococcus aureus (FT 192), Yersinia enterocolitica (FT 430), Salmonella infantis (FT 431), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (FT 432), Lactobacillus plantarum (FT234) and Lactobacillus casei (FT 232). Tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. Tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. A combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. It was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. The objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the toxic effects of the mycotoxins. The data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A and that this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 plus l-carnitine.
TI  - Blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in Gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoZ) expression.
AB  - The process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. In such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous DNA. Although the lacZ system has been used extensively for this purpose in E. coli, analogous systems for use in Gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. We have developed a Gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoZ, to identify recombinant plasmids. To facilitate introduction of foreign DNA, a multiple cloning site (MCS) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoZ. Alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoZ gene (phoZMCS) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. The phoZMCS was transferred to pJS3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pDC123. In pDC123, phoZMCS was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetM and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pJS3. S. agalactiae (Group B streptococci, GBS), E. faecalis, S. pyogenes, S. gordonii, and E. coli containing pDC123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (X-p), which was readily distinguished from that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pJS3. Introduction of foreign DNA into the MCS of phoZMCS produced a white colonial phenotype in E. coli and GBS on agar containing X-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. We have used pDC123 to subclone the cpsE gene from the plasmid pCER111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the GBS capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. The plasmid pDC123 containing cpsE was isolated by direct electroporation into GBS strain A909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. This new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant DNA experiments in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Partial budget of the discounted annual benefit of mastitis control strategies.
AB  - The objective of this study was to rank the benefits associated with various mastitis control strategies in simulated herds with intramammary infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. other than Strep. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Escherichia coli. The control strategies tested were prevention, vaccination for E. coli, lactation therapy, and dry cow antibiotic therapy. Partial budgets were based on changes caused by mastitis control strategies from the mean values for milk, fat, and protein yields of the control herd and the number of cows that were culled under a fixed mastitis culling criterion. Each annual benefit (dollars per cow per year) of a mastitis control strategy was compared with the revenue for the control herd and was calculated under two different milk pricing plans (3.5% milk fat and multiple-component pricing), three net replacement costs, and three prevalences of pathogen-specific intramammary infection. Twenty replicates of each control strategy were run with SIMMAST (a dynamic discrete event stochastic simulation model) for 5 simulated yr. Rankings of discounted annual benefits differed only slightly according to milk pricing plans within a pathogen group but differed among the pathogen groups. Differences in net replacement costs for cows culled because of mastitis did not change the ranking of control strategies within a pathogen group. Both prevention and dry cow therapy were important mastitis control strategies. For herds primarily infected with environmental pathogens, strategies that included vaccination for mastitis caused by E. coli dominated strategies that did not include vaccination against this microorganism.
TI  - In vitro activities of E1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - E1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. E1101 was the most active agent against S. agalactiae and E. coli. Since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, E1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. The in vivo efficacy of AM-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (E. coli and B. fragilis) model of rats. The accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in the AM-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. These results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent AM-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Favorable prognosis of purulent meningitis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - We prospectively reviewed all cases of purulent meningitis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected patients > 14 years old that occurred at the Hospital General Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona) during the period 1 January 1985 through 31 March 1997. There were 12 episodes of purulent meningitis in nine of 2,150 HIV-1-infected patients. The annual rate of purulent meningitis was 0.465 cases per 1,000 patients, a rate that is 150 times higher than that for the general population. During 10 episodes, CD4+ lymphocyte counts were < 200/mm3. The etiologic organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae in nine episodes (seven episodes occurred in four splenectomized patients), and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecium each caused one episode. Clinical features and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were similar to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. All patients had bacteremia. The overall mortality was 8.3%. We conclude that purulent meningitis, particularly pneumococcal meningitis, is more frequent among HIV-1-infected patients than in the general population. The prognosis for HIV-1-infected patients is better than for HIV-1-negative patients.
TI  - The Streptococcus agalactiae hylB gene encoding hyaluronate lyase: completion of  the sequence and expression analysis.
AB  - We report the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the Streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hylB4755 allele, the first chromosomally-encoded streptococcal hyaluronate lyase gene to be cloned and sequenced completely. This gene lies in a region homologous to that found in S. mutans, between the mutX and rmlB genes, a region involved in the synthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of this organism. Sequencing of hylB4755 revealed a 3216-bp open reading frame that encodes a 121.2-kDa polypeptide possessing a 30-amino acid signal sequence which was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. A recombinant plasmid, pHYB100, containing hylB4755 together with its promoter and terminator was constructed and used to analyze the expression of the gene in Escherichia coli. In Northern hybridization experiments, hylB4755 was found to be transcribed as 3.3-kb monocistronic mRNA from its own promoter which exhibits an extended, sigma70-like 10 consensus sequence. Transcript mapping by primer extension analysis placed the major transcription initiation site leading to the longest transcript 38 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon, ATG. E. coli TG1(pHYB100) efficiently synthesized hyaluronan-cleaving enzyme activity at approximately 7000 working units/109 cells, with lyase activity detectable in all principle cellular locations. Zymography and Western analysis identified functional activity in TG1(pHYB100) to be associated with approximately 118, 110 and 94-kDa polypeptides, with the two low molecular weight species constituting the major components of the enzyme purified from the culture supernatant fluid of S. agalactiae 4755. The 118-kDa form was shown to represent the undegraded mature enzyme, whereas the smaller species are likely to arise from proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal part of the mature protein. The HylB4755 protein showed extensive sequence identity to the homologous enzymes from S. agalactiae 3502 and S. pneumoniae characterized by others but sequence comparisons clearly show that incomplete genes truncated at their 5' ends had been isolated from these two organisms.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - Adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  - Three strains of Lactobacillus, identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization or antagonism. All three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as G. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. The surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for L. gasseri and lipoproteins for L. acidophilus and L. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. The factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (L. acidophilus and L. gasseri) and carbohydrate (L. jensenii). The receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.
TI  - Group B streptococci persist inside macrophages.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are an important cause of neonatal sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis. In the early phase of infection, macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) are the first immune cells that interact with GBS. In this in vitro study, to gain insight into GBS-macrophage interaction in the absence of type-specific antibodies, we examined the features of GBS survival in thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages and the effect of GBS on the protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent transduction pathway. Our results demonstrate that type Ia GBS, strain 090 (GBS-Ia) and type III GBS strain COH 31r/s (GBS-III), after in vitro phagocytosis survive and persist intracellularly in macrophages for up to 24 and 48 hr, respectively. However, macrophage activation by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli (LPS) caused a significant reduction in the time of intracellular persistence. Macrophage activation by IFN-gamma and LPS seems to be a multifactorial event involving multiple intracellular signal pathways also including PKC. Since PKC is one of the components in the signal network leading to macrophage activation and an important target for several intracellular micro-organisms, we wondered whether PKC could have a role in intracellular GBS survival. Both PKC depletion by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 18 hr and PKC inhibition by Calphostin C rendered macrophages more permissive for the intracellular GBS survival. Furthermore, GBS-infected macrophages were unable to respond to PMA and LPS, activators of PKC, by inducing antimicrobial activity. The ability of GBS to impair PKC-dependent cell signalling was also demonstrated by the reduced c-fos gene expression in GBS-infected macrophages with respect to control macrophages, after LPS stimulation. In conclusion, our results indicate that GBS survive in macrophages and impairment of PKC signal transduction contributes to their intracellular survival.
TI  - Identification of a novel insertion element, IS1548, in group B streptococci, predominantly in strains causing endocarditis.
AB  - Hyaluronidase has been postulated to be a virulence factor in group B streptococci (GBS). No hyaluronidase activity was found in 15 of 50 GBS isolates from adults studied. Most of these hyaluronidase-negative strains belonged to serotype III. In strains lacking hyaluronidase activity, an insertion of 1317 nucleotides was found in the hyaluronidase gene. The fragment was cloned and sequenced and found to have characteristics of a novel insertion sequence, designated IS1548. As well as in GBS serotype III, this sequence was found in 3 of 6 serotype II isolates and in all 10 group A streptococcal strains (GAS) tested. Homologies were found with repeated sequences in Streptococcus pneumoniae and with H repeats in Escherichia coli. All GBS strains harboring IS1548 and some GAS strains had one copy of IS1548 located downstream of the C5a peptidase gene. IS1548 was present in 9 of 13 GBS isolates from blood in endocarditis patients and in 3 of 22 vaginally colonizing strains.
TI  - Incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell counts.
AB  - Incidence of clinical mastitis was studied in 274 herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell count (SCC). Mean incidence rate of clinical mastitis was 0.278, 0.257, and 0.252 cases per 365 cow-days at risk in herds with low (< or = 150,000), medium (150,000 to 250,000), and high (250,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk SCC, respectively. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis was not different among the three categories. Variance in the incidence of clinical mastitis among herds increased as bulk milk SCC decreased. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., or Pseudomonas spp., occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk SCC. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk SCC. Systemic signs of illness caused by clinical mastitis occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk SCC. Both overall culling rate and culling rate for clinical mastitis were not different among groups catergorized by bulk milk SCC. In herds with a high bulk milk SCC, however, more cows that produced milk with a high SCC were culled. In herds with a low bulk milk SCC, more cows were culled for teat lesions, milkability, udder shape, fertility, and character than were cows in herds with a high bulk milk SCC. In herds with a low bulk milk SCC, cows were also culled more for export and production reasons.
TI  - A broad-host-range mobilizable shuttle vector for the construction of transcriptional fusions to beta-galactosidase in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A low-copy-number vector designated pTCV-lac has been constructed to provide a convenient system to analyze regulatory elements in Gram-positive bacteria. The main components of this vector are: (i) the origins of replication of pACYC184 and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1, (ii) erythromycin- and kanamycin-resistance-encoding genes for selection in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, (iii) the transfer origin of the IncP plasmid RK2, and (iv) a promoterless beta-galactosidase-encoding lacZ gene with a Gram-positive ribosome binding site. This 12 kb plasmid is present in Gram-positive hosts in three to five copies per chromosome equivalent and contains three unique cloning sites (EcoRI, SmaI, BamHI) for cloning of DNA inserts upstream of the lacZ gene. Plasmid pTCV-lac and derivatives carrying different promoter fragments have been transferred by conjugation from an Escherichia coli IncP mobilizing donor strain to Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. These plasmids were structurally stable in these hosts and the corresponding promoter activities, quantitated by the determination of the beta-galactosidase specific activities, were found to cover at least a 100-fold range in beta-galactosidase values. These results indicate that pTCV-lac should be useful for analysis of gene regulation in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Epidemiological studies of clinical and subclinical ovine mastitis in Awassi sheep in northern Jordan.
AB  - Forty-six Awassi sheep flocks selected by stratified random sampling were subjected to a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of intramammary infections, to assess the influence of flock size and parity on the prevalence of somatic cell count (SCC) and to identify major udder pathogens. Of the 3472 udder halves examined, 29.8% had over 10(6) SCC/ml and 0.03% had dry teats due to chronic mastitis. Flocks with 30-49 milking ewes (small flock size) were much younger (P < 0.001) than flocks with 50-99 ewes (medium) and flocks with > or = 100 ewes (large). Pairwise analysis of the InSCC of both halves of the udders revealed significant mean differences for small and large flock size (P < 0.05), and for medium and large flock size (P < 0.001). Mean InSCC was lower (P < 0.05) in samples obtained from the left half compared with samples of the right half of the udder. Multiparous ewes had higher (P < 0.001) mean InSCC than primiparous ewes. Also, ewes with twin lambs had higher (P < 0.001) mean InSCC in the right half of the udder compared with single-lamb ewes. Samples collected in January (winter) had lower (P < 0.05) mean InSCC compared with samples collected in June. The most common organisms isolated from subclinical mastitis cases were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (17.8%), E. coli (13.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.8%). Of the 46 flocks, 20 were monitored monthly for 9 consecutive months to determine the incidence of clinical mastitis diagnosed by shepherds or/and sheep farmers with major pathogens. The incidence of clinical mastitis (expressed as the number of clinical cases per 100 ewe-months) were 2.1 +/- 1.9 (SD), 1.9 +/- 1.1, and 1.2 +/- 2.1 for small, medium and large flocks size strata, respectively. The overall population estimate was 1.7 +/- 0.02 cases per 100 ewe-months. The most-common clinical isolates were S. aureus (22% of all clinical isolates) and E. coli (14.2%).
TI  - Giving selenium supplements to dairy cows strengthens the inflammatory response to intramammary infection and induces a growth-suppressing effect on mastitis pathogens in whey.
AB  - Supplementing the feed of selenium-deficient diary cows with selenium (Se)-yeast  or selenite at a level of 0.2 p.p.m. induced self-cure of subclinical mastitis; the prevalence of quarters harbouring subclinical mastitis (bacteriological criteria) decreased to about one half during the 8 week supplementation period. Three phenomena became apparent to explain the beneficial effect of selenium on mastitis: 1. The recruitment of phagocytes to the infected milk compartment of the udder was improved due to Se-supplementation; the correlation between infection and the respective inflammatory response, as indicated by the somatic cell count (SCC) and the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity (NAGase) of milk, was poor in selenium-deficient cows. Selenium supplementation significantly improved the correlation; 2. Selenium supplementation induced an unspecified antibacterial activity in milk lactoserum (whey), restricting in vitro growth of the mastitis pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis, bacterial growth rates in whey samples became inversely correlated with the respective blood glutathione peroxidase activities (GSH-Px); and 3. Selenium supplementation had an effect on redox activities and sulfhydryl activities in whey. These changes were correlated with in vitro bacterial growth rates.
TI  - Neonatal early-onset Escherichia coli disease. The effect of intrapartum ampicillin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal intrapartum ampicillin has been recommended for the prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of this practice, if any, on neonatal early-onset Escherichia coli infection and to delineate the clinical characteristics of infected neonates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All neonates with early-onset E coli infection who were born at Cook County Children's Hospital, Chicago, Ill, from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 1993, were identified from a microbiological register of all neonatal bacteremias and infections. Because intrapartum ampicillin use increased in our hospital since 1988, infection and case fatality rates from 1982 through 1987 (period 1) were compared with data from 1988 through 1993 (period 2). We studied maternal risk factors, clinical characteristics of infected neonates, and microbiological sensitivities of E coli isolates. RESULTS: Early-onset E coli infection was diagnosed in 30 of 61,498 live births. The overall infection rate (0.49 per 1000 live births) did not change significantly during the 2 time periods (0.37 per 1000 live births during period 1 vs 0.62 per 1000 live births during period 2, P = .21; chi 2 test); however, there was an increase in the infection rate in neonates weighing between 1501 and 2500 g. Infected neonates had a clinical syndrome that was indistinguishable from early-onset group B streptococcal infection; respiratory distress was the single most frequent finding in 73% (22/30) infected neonates. An increase in the proportion of infections caused by ampicillin-resistant E coli was observed during period 2 (12/18) compared with period 1 (3/12, P = .03; Fisher exact test). During period 2, 61% (11/18) of mothers of infected neonates received intrapartum ampicillin compared with 17% (2/12; P = .02) during period 1. Overall, a higher proportion of neonates born to ampicillin-treated women had ampicillin-resistant infection (12/13 vs 3/17; P < .001). Mothers of 10 of 15 neonates with ampicillin-resistant infection had received more than 2 doses of intrapartum ampicillin. The difference between the prevalence of intrapartum fever in mothers with sensitive organisms (40%, or 6/15) and resistant organisms (93%, or 14/15) was also significant (P = .003). All 6 early-onset E coli-related deaths were due to ampicillin-resistant organisms; 4 of the 6 mothers received intrapartum ampicillin. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown a shift of early-onset E coli infection from a less fulminant disease caused by ampicillin-sensitive organisms to a more fulminant disease caused by ampicillin-resistant organisms. Increased use of maternal intrapartum ampicillin therapy may account for these changes. In the absence of evidence for group B streptococcal disease, clinicians should consider the possibility of ampicillin-resistant E coli infection in critically ill neonates born to women with a history of intrapartum fever and treatment with intrapartum ampicillin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new carbapenem BO-2727 for use in obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BO-2727 against 100 clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (20 strains), Peptostreptococcus magnus (20 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (20 strains) and Prevotella bivia (20 strains) was compared with those of imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, biapenem and ceftazidime (CAZ). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 50% of tested strains (MIC50s) of BO-2727 against S. agalactiae, E. coli, P. magnus, B. fragilis and P. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. MIC90s of BO-2727 against S. agalactiae, E. coli, P. magnus, B. fragilis and P. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. The efficacy of BO-2727 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra model (E. coli and B. fragilis) in rats. Both the inflammatory changes in the uterus, from the point of view of neutrophil accumulation, and the bacteriological response in the treated group were milder than those in either the nontreated group or the CAZ-treated group. These results indicate that BO-2727 may be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in patients with pyometra.
TI  - Molecular characterization and expression analysis of the superoxide dismutase gene from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced a 3103-bp DNA fragment carrying the gene encoding the Mn-SOD from Streptococcus agalactiae NEM318 serotype III. This DNA fragment contained four orfs that have the same polarity of transcription. Orf1 was truncated by molecular cloning and the corresponding 228-aa-long polypeptide did not exhibit any significant homology with other cognate proteins. Orf2 encodes a protein of 345 aa that displays some similarity (29% identity) with the YqeN peptide of Bacillus subtilis, the function of which is unknown. Orf3 encodes the 202-aa-long Mn-SOD which was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Orf4 was also truncated by molecular cloning and encodes 99 aa of the N-terminal moiety of a protein that displays significant homology (40% f identity) with the antiterminator LicT of B. subtilis. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the sodA gene of S. agalactiae NEM318 was transcribed monocistronically from a promoter, the activity of which is neither regulated by pH, O2, nor CO2 concentrations of the culture medium. Analysis by high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis of the AluI DNA polymorphism of the sodA locus in wild-type strains of S. agalactiae belonging to serogroups I, II, or III revealed no detectable difference.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mreA, from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. In PCR assays, total genomic DNA from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from this strain was cloned into lambda Zap II to construct a library of S. agalactiae genomic DNA. A clone, pAES63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in Escherichia coli was recovered. Deletion derivatives of pAES63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. Studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into E. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. This putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described Mef pump in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent MsrA pump in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Its gene has been designated mreA (for macrolide resistance efflux).
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - Analysis of promoters in Borrelia burgdorferi by use of a transiently expressed reporter gene.
AB  - A transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression system was developed for Borrelia burgdorferi. An Escherichia coli vector containing a promoterless Streptococcus agalactiae cat gene was constructed. Promoters for ospA, ospC, and flaB were placed upstream of this cat gene, and CAT assays were performed in E. coli from these stably maintained plasmids. The plasmids with putative promoters ospA and flaB were found to be approximately 20-fold more active than were the plasmids with ospC or no promoter. The level of activity correlated well with the resistance to chloramphenicol that each plasmid provided. Next, the nonreplicative plasmid constructs were transformed by electroporation into B. burgdorferi. CAT assays were performed by both thin-layer chromatography and the fluor diffusion method. Measurement of CAT activity demonstrated that the ospA promoter was again about 20-fold more active than the promoterless cat gene. The flaB and ospC promoters increased the activity seven- and threefold, respectively, over that with the promoterless construct. This simple transient-expression assay was shown to be an effective method to study promoter function in B. burgdorferi in the absence of a well-developed genetic system.
TI  - New genetic techniques for group B streptococci: high-efficiency transformation,  maintenance of temperature-sensitive pWV01 plasmids, and mutagenesis with Tn917.
AB  - Three techniques were developed to improve the genetic manipulation of group B streptococci (GBS). We first optimized a protocol for transformation of GBS by electroporation, which provided transformation efficiencies of 10(5) CFU/microgram. Variables that influenced the transformation efficiency were the glycine content of the competent cell growth media, the electric field strength during electroporation, the electroporation buffer composition, the host origin of the transforming plasmid, and the concentration of selective antibiotic at the final plating. Our transformation protocol provides an efficiency sufficient for cloning from ligation reactions directly into GBS, obviating an intermediate host such as Escherichia coli. Second, temperature-sensitive plasmids of the pWV01 lineage were shown to transform GBS, and their temperature-sensitive replication was confirmed. Lastly, the temperature-sensitive pWV01 plasmid pTV1OK, which contains Tn917, was used as a transposon delivery vector for the construction of genomic Tn917 mutant libraries. We have shown, for the first time, that Tn917 transposes to the GBS chromosome and at a frequency of 10(-3)/CFU. Furthermore, representative clones from a Tn917 library contained single transposon insertions that were randomly located throughout the chromosome. These techniques should provide useful methods for cloning, mutagenesis, and characterization of genes from GBS.
TI  - A prospective study of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in southern Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the Negev area of southern Israel. DESIGN: A prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the Soroka University Medical Center. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. Thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. During this period 70,709 births (59% Jews and 41% Bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. One hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in Bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in Jewish neonates (P < 0.001). Twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from Days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between Days 8 and 28. A total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. Fifty-seven of all isolates were Gram-negative organisms (mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and Escherichia coli (16%)). Gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. Although E. coli was the most frequently recovered Gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms in nosocomial late onset sepsis. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in late onset sepsis were nosocomial. The incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae was 3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. All cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in Bedouins. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern Israel are similar to those reported in Western Europe and the United States. The incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for Bedouins than for Jewish neonates. The distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern Israel and although Gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, S. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. In southern Israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.

TI  - Blood-brain barrier permeability during the development of experimental bacterial meningitis in the rat.
AB  - In an attempt to examine whether routes of bacterial entry into the central nervous system have any bearing on subsequent changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of circulating 125I-albumin in two different models of experimental meningitis due to K1 Escherichia coli, type III group B streptococcus, or Haemophilus influenzae type b in infant rats: hematogenous meningitis subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation of bacteria vs meningitis induced by direct inoculation of bacteria into the CSF via the cisterna magna. In the model of hematogenous meningitis, the mean CSF penetration was significantly greater in animals with H. influenzae type b meningitis than in those with meningitis due to K1 E. coli or type III group B streptococcus. In contrast, the mean CSF penetration was significantly enhanced in all animals with meningitis induced by intracisternal inoculation regardless of infecting pathogens. Tumor necrosis factor activity in CSF appeared to correlate with the functional penetration of circulating albumin across the blood-brain barrier in both models of experimental meningitis. These findings suggest that the alterations of blood-brain barrier permeability during development of experimental meningitis may vary for different models of inducing meningitis and that the mechanisms responsible for these different permeability changes may be multifactorial.
TI  - The RIB element in the goaG-pspF intergenic region of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The sequence (2,700 bp) between the aldH and pspF genes of Escherichia coli was determined. The pspF gene encodes a sigma54 transcriptional activator of the phage shock protein (psp) operon (pspA to pspE). Downstream of the pspF transcribed region are two open reading frames (ORFs), ordL and goaG, convergently oriented with respect to pspF. These two ORFs, together with the adjacent aldH gene, may constitute a novel operon (aldH-ordL-goaG). The goaG-pspF intergenic region contains a complex extragenic mosaic element, RIB. The structure of this RIB element, which belongs to the BIME-1 family, is Y(REP1) > 16 < Z1(REP2), where Y and Z1 are palindromic units and the central 16 bases contain an L motif with an ihf consensus sequence. DNA fragments containing the L motif of the psp RIB element effectively bind integration host factor (IHF), while the Y palindromic unit (REP1) of the same RIB element binds DNA gyrase weakly. Computer prediction of the pspF mRNA secondary structure suggested that the transcribed stem-loop structures formed by the 3'-flanking region of the pspF transcript containing the RIB element can stabilize and protect pspF mRNA. Analysis of pspF steady-state mRNA levels showed that transcripts with an intact RIB element are much more abundant than those truncated at the 3' end by deletion of either the entire RIB element or a single Z1 sequence (REP2). Thus, the pspF 3'-flanking region containing the RIB element has an important role in the stabilization of the pspF transcript.
TI  - Ampicillin susceptibilities of vaginal and placental isolates of group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli obtained between 1992 and 1994.
AB  - Vaginal group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli isolates were tested for their susceptibilities to ampicillin. All 414 GBS isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin; the MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) was 0.125 microg/ml, and the range was 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml. The MIC50 for the 342 E. coli isolates tested was 4.0 microg/ml, and 27% were resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of pOM1, a small cryptic plasmid from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for Butyrivibrios.
AB  - As a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF1 and pRJF2, pOM1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF1 and ORF2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized-Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM1 has been used in the construction of a new Escherichia coli-B. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF1 plasmid.
TI  - Characterization of two distinct opsonic and protective epitopes within the alpha C protein of the group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of neonatal sepsis, meningitis in early infancy, postpartum endometritis, and serious invasive infections in adults in the United States. We previously cloned, sequenced, and characterized the alpha antigen gene, bca, and showed that the alpha C protein of GBS is a trypsin-resistant, surface-associated polypeptide that contains a signal sequence, a unique N terminus, nine identical tandem repeats, and a C-terminal membrane anchor structure. Polyclonal antiserum raised to the recombinant alpha C protein and an opsonic monoclonal antibody, 4G8, raised to the native protein from GBS have been shown to be protective in a mouse model. The binding site of 4G8 has now been localized to the tandem repeat region of the alpha C protein. To determine whether the N terminus of the alpha C protein contains additional opsonic and/or protective epitopes, the sequence corresponding to the alpha C protein N terminus was subcloned into a pET vector, the expressed peptide from Escherichia coli was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised to the purified recombinant peptide. Antibodies to the alpha C protein N terminus were shown to be opsonic by an in vitro opsonophagocytosis assay. In addition, 69% of newborn mouse pups from mothers passively immunized with the antiserum to the recombinant N-terminal polypeptide of the alpha C protein were protected against lethal challenge with GBS A909. These data indicate that at least two distinct regions of the alpha C protein, the N terminus and the tandem repeat region, contain opsonic and protective epitopes.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from Propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. The gene was isolated on an EcoRI-generated 3-kb piece of DNA. Expression was less in Escherichia coli than in P. acnes; in E. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. The gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kDa. Amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. The leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. The amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Vaginal colonization by Escherichia coli as a risk factor for very low birth weight delivery and other perinatal complications.
AB  - This study evaluated the relationship of vaginal Escherichia coli colonization to birth weight <1500 g and other perinatal complications in a cross-sectional study of 2646 women at the University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, between October 1992 and January 1995. Vaginal E. coli colonization was more strongly associated with delivery at <34 weeks (relative risk [RR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.3) and very low birth weight (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.7) than with prematurity between 34 and 36 weeks or low birth weight. Heavy growth of E. coli had a higher risk of very low birth weight than light growth (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0-6.2). It may be important to screen and treat pregnant women for genital tract colonization with E. coli during prenatal care.
TI  - Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (H17B) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. METHOD: H17B and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (H21B)) were assayed by HPLC. RESULTS: In the absence of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. In the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that H17B degradation was not modified by cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae). Three bacilli increased degradation, Escherichia coli 59.1 +/- 19.4%, Klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0 +/- 17.9%. CONCLUSION: The degradation of H17B into hydrortisone and H21B may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.
TI  - Tissue penetration of Meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. Patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. Plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. The median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/mL. The median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. These tissue concentrations exceed the MICs of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. Meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. A single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Development of a group B Streptococcus (GBS) cloning system.
AB  
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a protective surface protein from type V group B streptococci.
AB  - This report describes a trypsin-resistant laddering protein purified from a type  V strain, a serotype of important emerging clinical significance. This protein is present in a majority of type V clinical strains, elicits protective antibody in an animal model, and is cross-reactive with the alpha C protein and R1. The gene encoding this protein has been cloned; preliminary nucleotide sequence analysis reveals significant homology, though not identity, with the alpha C protein gene. These data support the hypothesis that there exists a family of related but distinct GBS surface proteins which may play a role in immunity to GBS infection.
TI  - Cloning of the glutamine synthetase gene from group B streptococci.
AB  - The glnA gene from the human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae was cloned from a  genomic library prepared with the lambda phage vector lambdaDASHII. A 4.6-kb DNA fragment of one of the recombinant phages was subcloned in pUC18. This Escherichia coli clone expressed a 52-kDa protein encoded by a 1,341-bp open reading frame. The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence shared a significant degree of homology with the sequences of other glutamine synthetases (GS). The highest homology was between our deduced protein and GS of gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Plasmids with the cloned streptococcal glnA were able to complement E. coli glnA mutants grown on minimal media. Rabbit antisera to streptococcal GS recombinant protein recognized not only the recombinant protein but also a similar-sized band in mutanolysin extracts of all group B streptococcal strains tested, regardless of polysaccharide type or surface protein profile. The amino acid sequence of the deduced protein had similarities to other streptococcal cell-surface-bound proteins. The possible functional role of the immunological features of streptococcal GS is discussed.
TI  - A method for determination of the absolute configuration of chiral glycerol residues in natural products using TEMPO oxidation and characterization of the glyceric acids formed.
AB  - A method has been developed for determination of the absolute configuration of glycerol residues in natural products. It is required that the glycerol moiety contain a primary nonsubstituted hydroxymethyl group or that such a group can be obtained by modification without racemization. The method employs TEMPO oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group, hydrolysis, butanolysis with chiral 2-butanol, and acetylation. The acetylated (+)-2-butyl esters of the glyceric acid formed by oxidation are analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The esterification can also be performed with other chiral alcohols, e.g., (-)-2-octanol. The method is general and applicable to both primary and secondary substituted glycerols. It has recently been used for determination of the chiral glycerol-1-phosphate residue of the Escherichia coli O28 O-antigen, and now we report the absolute configurations of the glycerol moieties in Streptococcus pneumoniae type 18A and Streptococcus agalactaie type III. All studied glycerol residues were found to have the D-configuration.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Usefulness of body surface cultures in newborns with early infection risk. Study of 735 neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Difficulty in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis has lead to the practice of superficial cultures. The usefulness of this practice has been criticized repeatedly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Results of 3881 cultures performed on 735 newborns (age < or = 48 hr) with early infection risk were reviewed. The types of samples chosen were urine (UR), gastric aspirate (GA), pharyngeal (PS), external ear (ES), umbilical swab (US), meconium (MC) and blood. BBV for sepsis for the different samples is calculated, as well as which ones better reflect vertical transmission. RESULTS: At the time of the study, 342 newborns (46.5%) were already colonized. Bacteria most frequently isolated were: E. coli (92), PCN staphylococci (85), enterococci (83) and S. agalactiae (70). Twenty-nine newborns had bacteriemia, with S. agalactiae being the leading cause (16). ES correlated best with positive blood cultures (83.3%). UR culture sensitivity was significantly lower than that of all other samples. The Highest PPVs were for GA, PS and US. NPV was high and similar for all samples (98-99%). ES and US best reflected vertical transmission (p < 0.0001). MC provided the highest number of positive mixed cultures, most of them difficult to evaluate. CONCLUSIONS: Body surface sample advantages are: 1) The possibility of discarding a vertically transmitted infection. 2) Quicker positive results than those in blood whenever liquid blood culture media are employed. 3) The possible identification of the etiologic agent when the mother has been given antibiotics intrapartum. 4). Information about dangerous colonization without infection. In order not to lose this useful information, but to save cost and effort, we advise that the number of surface cultures be reduced, keeping only ES and PS?
TI  - Variation in repeat number within the alpha C protein of group B streptococci alters antigenicity and protective epitopes.
AB  - Variable expression of repeating units of the protective alpha C proteins among clinical isolates of group B streptococci (GBS) may have implications for vaccine development. In this study, alpha C protein genes containing various numbers of repeats (1,2,9, and 16) were cloned in a T7 overexpression vector in Escherichia coli. Expression was induced by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and proteins were purified by anion-exchange, gel filtration, or affinity chromatography or by isoelectric focusing. Rabbits were immunized with purified 1-,2-,9-, or 16-repeat proteins. All proteins appeared to be highly immunogenic. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition with 9-repeat protein as the coating antigen and 9-repeat-antigen-elicited antiserum showed that a 200-fold-higher concentration of 1-repeat antigen than of 9- or 16-repeat antigen was required for 50% inhibition of antibody-antigen binding. The concentration of 2-repeat antigen required for 50% inhibition was intermediate relative to the concentrations of 1- and 9-repeat antigens. These results suggested that antibodies to 9-repeat antigen recognized predominantly a conformational epitope(s) contained in proteins with higher numbers of repeats (9 or 16) but lost considerable binding affinities for an epitope(s) contained in alpha C proteins with fewer repeats (1 or 2). Similar results were obtained with antiserum to 16-repeat antigen. However, antibodies to 1- and 2-repeat antigens recognized 1-,2-,9-,and 16-repeat antigens with equal binding affinities. This finding suggested that 1- and 2-repeat-elicited antibodies recognized an epitope(s) on individual repeats. Loss of repeating units from the alpha C proteins may result in decreased protection because the loss of epitopes (including conformational epitopes) gives the microorganisms the opportunity to escape host antibodies. If 1- and 2-repeat-elicited antibodies bind all alpha C proteins with equal affinity, regardless of their repeat number, they may prevent GBS strains with fewer repeats from escaping host immunity. Protection data obtained with antisera to the proteins with different repeat numbers support this hypothesis: mouse pups challenged with GBS strain A909 were better protected when immunized with 1- or 2-repeat-elicited antiserum (76 and 75%, respectively) than when immunized with 9- or 16-repeat-elicited antiserum (41 and 48%, respectively).
TI  - [Evaluation of urine screening in healthy infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate urine screening in healthy infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of the medical records of all children born between June 1, 1993 and May 31, 1995 who are registered at a primary care center in the south of Madrid. Two hundred eighty-eight 1-month-old babies were tested (131 boys and 157 girls) with a urine dipstick (Combur-9 Test) and a uroculture was performed in those children whose test showed an alteration in the dipstick. In patients with urinary tract infection, the study was completed with radiographic procedures RESULTS: Of all tests carried out, only 61 were positive (21.1%) and urinary tract infection was confirmed in 9 patients (14%). A grade II vesicoureteral reflux was detected in only one girl (1.6% of patients with positive test and 0.3% of all the infants studied). The follow up of the 227 infants with initial negative screening found urinary tract infections in 9 of them (3.9%), without malformations of the genitourinary tract. CONCLUSIONS: This study has proven a low positive predictive value of the urine dipstick (1.6%) for urine screening. The authors believe that this screening should be reserved for infants with symptoms of urinary tract infection or at risk groups of children in order to avoid the study and treatment of infants with asymptomatic bacteria.
TI  - Penetration of cefpodoxime into uterine and vaginal secretions from postpartum women after a single oral dose of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) The susceptibilities of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. The MIC at which the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (MIC90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) Seven puerperal women received 200 mg of CPDX-PR orally. The CPDX concentration in the lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. The CPDX concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after CPDX-PR administration. The CPDX concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and gradually declined thereafter. These results suggest that CPDX-PR, with its good transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Volume of blood required to detect common neonatal pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimum volume of blood and the absolute number of organisms required for detection of bacteremia and fungemia by an automated colorimetric blood culture system (BacT/Alert, Organon Teknika). DESIGN: Common neonatal pathogens, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus (GBS): one American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain and one clinical isolate), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans, were seeded into blood to produce bacteremia or fungemia with low colony counts (1 to 3 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter) and ultra-low colony counts (<1 CFU/ml). For each organism, 96 culture bottles were inoculated with either 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 ml of the two seeded blood concentrations. Blood culture bottles were incubated in the BacT/Alert device for 5 days, and time to positivity was noted when applicable. All bottles were subcultured on plated media. DATA ANALYSIS: The Poisson statistic was used to calculate the probability of finding at least one viable CFU per inoculated culture bottle. The fraction of culture bottles with positive findings per group was divided by the probability of one or more organisms present to give the positivity index. RESULTS: Plated subculture identified no growth of organisms not detected by the colorimetric detection system. The false-positive rate for the automated device was less than 1%. The positivity index for the GBS clinical isolate was 1.13, for the GBS ATCC isolate 0.96, for S. epidermidis 0.94, for C. albicans 0.97, and for E. coli 0.95. There was a statistically significant difference with time to positivity and inocula volume (p <0.01), but the difference was not clinically important. CONCLUSIONS: If one or two viable colony-forming units are in the blood inoculated into culture media, the BacT/Alert system will detect growth rapidly. Because there appears to be a sizable subset of neonates who are at risk of sepsis with a colony count less than 4 CFU/ml, then a 0.5 ml inoculum of blood into the culture media is inadequate for sensitive and timely detection of bacteremia. One to two milliliters of blood should increase microorganism recovery in the face of low-colony-count sepsis.
TI  - Interleukin-6 production by human neonatal monocytes stimulated by type III group B streptococci.
AB  - The subcellular components of type III group B streptococci (GBS) that contribute to the host inflammatory response were determined by measuring production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 by cord blood monocytes. Monocytes were stimulated with encapsulated (COH1) or unencapsulated (COH1-13) whole type III GBS or with purified GBS components, including type III capsular polysaccharide (III-PS), group B antigen (GB-Ag), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Monocytes exposed to COH1 and COH1-13 released similar amounts of IL-6. GBS III-PS, GB-Ag, and LTA each induced IL-6. However, IL-6 release by monocytes was significantly greater after stimulation by GB-Ag than by III-PS or LTA (P < .05). Sera from 16 neonates with systemic GBS disease had IL-6 levels of 8 pg/mL to 4.28 ng/mL. GB-Ag is a potent inducer of IL-6 and may play an important role in tissue inflammation during GBS infection.
TI  - Conservation of the C5a peptidase genes in group A and B streptococci.
AB  - The chromosome of group B streptococci (GBS) contains a gene which is related to  the C5a peptidase gene (scpA) of group A streptococci (GAS). scpA encodes a surface-associated peptidase (group A streptococcal C5a peptidase [SCPA]) which specifically cleaves C5a, a major chemoattractant generated in serum by activation of complement. The entire scpA-like gene (scpB) was cloned from a GBS strain and sequenced. The gene encodes an open reading frame of 3,450 bp, which corresponds to a deduced protein (SCPB) of 1,150 amino acids with a molecular weight of 126,237 Da. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of SCPB were found to be highly homologous to those of SCPAs from GAS. Unexpectedly, scpA12 is more similar to scpB than to another GAS gene, scpA49. The sequence 5' of the open reading frame, including transcription start and a termination site in the signal sequence, is also similar to that of scpA, although less conserved than the coding sequences. The near identity of GBS and GAS peptidases is consistent with horizontal transmission of the scp gene between these species. Recombinant SCPB was expressed in Escherichia coli by using the expression vector plasmid pGEX-4T-1 and was shown to be identical in size to the enzyme extracted from the parental GBS strain 78-471.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the CAMP factor gene of Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The gene coding for the CAMP factor from a strain of Streptococcus uberis (ATCC 9927) was cloned in Escherichia coli. Chromosomal DNA from Streptococcus uberis was used to construct a gene library in plasmid pTZ18R and six CAMP-reaction positive clones were obtained from a total of 10,000 transformants. One clone, pJLD21, was subcloned and the CAMP factor gene was located in a 3.2 kb BamHI fragment. The nucleotide sequence of Streptococcus uberis CAMP factor gene was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the corresponding Streptococcus agalactiae protein. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the recombinant strain pJLD21 expressed a protein with a molecular weight of 28 000. Antibodies raised against purified Streptococcus uberis CAMP factor cross-reacted with Streptococcus agalactiae protein B.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of meropenem against clinically isolated strains. The result against strains isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of meropenem (MEPM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MEPM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid that were obtained from January, 1993 to December, 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The MIC-range, 50% MIC (MIC50) and 90% MIC (MIC90) of MEPM were equal to those of imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) against Streptococcus pneumoniae including benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes which are Gram-positive strains, and were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and cefotaxime (CTX). 2. The MIC-range, MIC50 and MIC90 of these 3 drugs of carbapenems (MEPM, IPM and PAPM) were different against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae which are Gram-negative strains. The MIC90 of MEPM was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml and those of IPM and PAPM were 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli. The MIC90 of MEPM was 0.1 microgram/ml, that of IPM was 25 micrograms/ml and that of PAPM was 6.25 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. Thus, the antimicrobial activity of MEPM was stronger than those of IPM and PAPM. The MIC90's of IPM and PAPM against H. influenzae were high with the MIC of IPM at 12.5 approximately 25 micrograms/ml and the MIC of PAPM at 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml against 3 IPM-resistant strains among 17 isolates. 3. The MIC90 of ABPC was 0.39 microgram/ml and that of CTX was 0.1 microgram/ml against 20 strains of S. pneumoniae including 6 strains of PCG-insensitive or resistant S. pneumoniae. The MIC90 of ABPC and CTX were higher than those of 3 carbapenem drugs. There were E. coli of 8 strains with ABPC-high resistance (the MIC of ABPC was > 100 micrograms/ml) and 2 strains for which MIC of CTX were 0.39 microgram/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was found that 29.4% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producing strains. 4. It appeared that antimicrobial activities of carbapenems, particularly MEPM were strong against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. MEPM will be first choice drug by empiric therapy in infections including sepsis and purulent meningitis.
TI  - Efficacy of florfenicol for treatment of clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy of florfenicol treatment for bovine mastitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus nonagalactiae streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, and others. DESIGN: Double blind study with cases randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. SAMPLE POPULATION: 861 cows/10 commercial dairy farms. PROCEDURE: Experimental (750 mg of florfenicol) or control (200 mg of cloxacillin) treatment was administered by intramammary infusion every 12 hours for 3 treatment to all cases. Treatments were randomly assigned identified only by numerical labels. To retain blinding, the longer withdrawal time was adhered to for all cases. Cases remained in the study only if there was no other treatment. Quarter samples were recultured 14, 21, and 28 days later. If all samples after day 1 were culture negative, the case was defined as cured. If only 1 of the follow-up results was positive, the case was considered cured if the day-28 somatic cell count was < 300,000/ ml. Failure of treatment was defined as 2 or more culture positive follow-up samples. RESULTS: Florfenicol and cloxacillin did not differ significantly in efficacy versus clinical (n = 85) or subclinical (n = 71) bovine mastitis, or for any etiologic agent (X2). Overall cure rates for mastitis were: Str agalactiae, 5 of 8 (63%); Sta aureus, 5 of 54 (9%); Streptococcus sp, 16 of 35 (46%); Staphylococcus sp, 7 of 33 (21%); E coli, 5 of 11 (46%); Klebsiella sp, 3 of 6 (50%); others, 1 of 9 (11%); and all cases, 42 of 156 (27%). CONCLUSIONS: Florfenicol did not offer any advantage over cloxacillin in efficacy against bovine mastitis. Overall cure rates were low. As with most mastitis treatment regimens poor efficacy may be partly attributable to the short duration of treatment.
TI  - Characterization of cpsF and its product CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase,  a group B streptococcal enzyme that can function in K1 capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the foremost cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the United States. A major virulence factor for GBS is its capsular polysaccharide, a high molecular weight polymer of branched oligosaccharide subunits. N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid), at the end of the polysaccharide side chains, is critical to the virulence function of the capsular polysaccharide. Neu5Ac must be activated by CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase before it is incorporated into the polymer. We showed previously that a transposon mutant of a serotype III GBS strain which had no detectable capsular Neu5Ac was deficient in CMP-Neu5Ac-synthetase activity (Wessels et al., 1992). In this paper, we report the identification and characterization of cpsF, a gene interrupted by transposon insertion in the previously described Neu5Ac-deficient mutant. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cpsF gene product shares 57% similarity and 37% identity with CMP-Neu5Ac synthase encoded by the Escherichia coli K1 gene, neuA. The enzymatic function of the protein encoded by cpsF was established by cloning the gene E. coli under the control of the T7 polymerase/promoter. Lysates of E. coli in which the cpsF gene product was expressed, catalysed the condensation of CTP with Neu5Ac to form CMP-Neu5Ac. In addition, when CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase-deficient mutant of E. coli K1 was transformed with cpsF, K1 antigen expression was restored. We concluded that cpsF encodes CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase in type III GBS, and that the GBS enzyme can function in the capsule-synthesis of a heterologous bacterial species.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - Effects of freezing on the viability of nine pathogens from quarters with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Milk samples from 45 quarters containing mastitis pathogens were collected from lactating cows to determine the viability of those pathogens after freezing. An initial bacteria count was conducted, and samples were divided into 2-ml portions and frozen. Weekly bacteria counts were conducted for 6 wk. Viability after freezing was determined on five isolates of nine bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus xylosus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteria counts were converted to logarithm base 10, and analysis of variance was conducted to determine alterations in viability over the 6-wk period. Freezing of quarter milk samples for 6 wk did not affect viability of any of these pathogens.
TI  - Effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. We examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (Alveofact, Survanta and Exosurf) approved for treatment of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on Legionella pneumophila serogroup I as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. Addition of Survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined E. coli strains. As opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the exception of Exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of group B streptococci. Though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - Potency of antibacterial drugs in milk as analysed by beta-glucuronidase-based fluorometry.
AB  - The potency of selected antibacterials on mastitis-causing Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactine and Streptococcus uberis in milk, whey and Iso-sensitest broth (ISB) was compared, based on the suppression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase production. The beta-glucuronidase activity in the samples was analysed by substrate-defined fluorometry where the turbidity of milk does not disturb the assay. In ISB, all four E. coli strains were susceptible to enrofloxacin and gentamicin, sulfadoxin-trimethoprim and tetracycline. S. agalactiae and S. uberis strains were susceptible in ISB to most of the antibacterials tested. The antibacterial potency of sulfadoxin-trimethoprim, tetracycline, novobiocin, gentamicin and enrofloxacin on E. coli and S. agalactiae were considerably decreased in milk as compared with that in ISB. However, S. uberis seemed to be more susceptible to antibacterials in milk or whey than in ISB. Regression analysis of the sigmoidal dose-response curves of sulfadoxin-trimethoprim showed that slopes of the linearized lines seemed to become less steep in milk than in the artificial broth medium, indicating a shift of the bactericidic effect in ISB towards a bacteriostatic effect in milk.
TI  - Clinical and diagnostic features of osteomyelitis occurring in the first three months of life.
AB  - We report a retrospective study of 94 infants, ages < 4 months, who underwent investigation for possible osteomyelitis during a 9-year period. Of the 30 babies with proven osteomyelitis (radiographic changes or positive bone cultures or positive blood cultures plus a compatible clinical picture), 17 were preterm artificially ventilated babies and 4 were full term infants receiving intensive care. An etiologic organism was isolated from 28: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 16; methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 7; Escherichia coli, 3; and group B Streptococcus, 2. MRSA occurred exclusively in the preterm group. Osteomyelitis was multifocal in 40% and associated with septic arthritis in 47%. The long bones were frequently affected (80%) whereas the flat bones were often sites of clinically silent disease. Twenty-five (83.3%) of the 30 babies with proven osteomyelitis had focal clinical signs or evidence of disseminated staphylococcal disease. Only 10 were febrile. Four of 27 babies investigated because of positive blood cultures for S. aureus but no focal signs had osteomyelitis, as did only 1 of 27 babies with suspected sepsis but no focal signs. The sensitivity of 99mTc bone scanning was 84%, specificity 89%, positive predictive value 79% and negative predictive value 92%. The addition of gallium scanning (in 39 of the 94 infants) improved the respective figures to 90, 97, 93 and 95% and was useful in interpreting equivocal bone scans.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].

TI  - Infection of the pancreatic duct following pancreas transplantation with bladder  drainage.
AB  - Combined kidney-pancreas transplantation represents a widely accepted therapy for endstage diabetic nephropathy. Drainage of the pancreatic juice into the urinary bladder is the preferred surgical technique in most centers. Between January 1987 and December 1994 a total of 85 pancreas transplantations with pancreatocystostomy were performed at the Innsbruck University Hospital. In all cases a polyvinylcatheter was placed into the pancreatic duct and drained transvesically to the exterior. During several weeks after transplantation pure pancreatic juice was harvested for immunological and microbiological monitoring. Whenever a patient required antibiotic treatment, antibiotic concentrations in pancreatic juice, urine or serum were determined by means of a biological test system using Bacillus subtilis. Nine different ATCC bacterial strains were incubated in pancreatic juice collected from transplant recipients and tested for their multiplication rate. Thirteen patients acquired an infection of the pancreatic duct. Non-fermentative bacteria, gram-negative rods, Enterococcus spp. and Candida spp. were the most often isolated organisms. The in vitro tests revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Escherichia coli grew very well whereas Streptococcus agalactiae was unable to multiply in pancreatic juice. Ampicillin/sulbactam was found to be excreted in high concentrations into the pancreatic juice. Many other tested antibiotics (cephalosporins, carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides) achieved levels below the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for most bacteria. Antibiotic treatment was required for up to 5 weeks to eliminate the pathogens from the pancreas but was successful in 11 out of the 13 patients at the end. The results of this study led to changes in our antibiotic policy and helped to improve the results after pancreatic transplantation.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of the bovine myeloperoxidase system against bacteria associated with mastitis.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a lysosomal enzyme found in the primary granules of mammalian neutrophils. Together with MPO, peroxide and halide form a system of defense against bacteria. The present investigation was undertaken to study the bactericidal effects of the bovine-MPO/peroxide/halide system on pathogenic bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. We demonstrated that MPO together with oxidizing agents generated by xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine and chloride form a potent antibacterial system against the common udder pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Escherichia coli in a synthetic medium. However, when milk was added to the reaction mixture, the bactericidal properties of this enzyme system were completely inhibited. Loss of bactericidal activity in the milk-containing cultures was unable to be restored by increasing the concentration of MPO. Nor did an increase in concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, or the replacement of the above-mentioned peroxidase generating system with a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide, significantly elevated the bactericidal activity that was inhibited by milk. The addition of bovine serum albumin to the synthetic medium reduced the bactericidal activity of the MPO/peroxide/chloride system in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, milk proteins probably form adducts with strong bactericidal agents that are generated by the MPO system and thereby reduce the bactericidal potential of this system.
TI  - A fluorometric beta-glucuronidase assay for analysis of bacterial growth in milk.
AB  - The growth of common mastitis-causing bacteria in milk was followed by a fluorometric technique based on the release of fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) from 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide by the beta-glucuronidase of bacterial or milk origin. Three of four Escherichia coli strains, all four strains of Streptococcus uberis (4/4) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4/4) produced beta-glucuronidase. Four Staphylococcus aureus strains (4/4) and one E. coli strain, though unable to produce the enzyme, activated the milk beta-glucuronidase most probably by lowering the pH of bacterial cultures in milk for optimum activity of the indigenous enzyme. The beta-glucuronidase of milk, Str. uberis and Str. agalactiae origin had similar optimum pH ranges (5.3-6.6) while E. coli beta-glucuronidase was more active at neutral or slightly alkaline pH (6.8-7.7). The increase of beta-glucuronidase activity in milk cultures of E. coli, Str. uberis, Str. agalactiae and S. aureus seemed to parallel the increase of colony forming units and were dependent on the inoculum size. The time to reach a predetermined enzyme threshold in E. coli-milk cultures showed excellent linear relationship with the inoculum size.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The followings, ampicillin (ABPC) and vancomycin (VCM) showed potent activities, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC), minocycline (MINO) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus VCM showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Dicloxacillin (MDIPC) and arbekacin (ABK) were active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. MINO showed the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. All other agents except ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed lower activity. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis MINO showed the highest activity against S. epidermidis. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. The followings, ABK and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others except CPFX were not so active. 4. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) Most of the agents were active against CNS. IPM, ABK and MINO showed the highest activities with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MDIPC, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml. Clindamycin (CLDM) showed lower activity, with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. Streptococcus agalactiae CEZ, cefuzonam (CZON), IPM and CLDM showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the MIC of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The followings, cefmenoxime (CMX) and erythromycin (EM) were active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. PIPC and VCM were also active with the MIC90S 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively Amikacin (AMK) showed lower activity. Escherichia coli IPM, CTM, flomoxef (FMOX), CMX, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and CPFX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were .125 microgram/ml or below. ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZON were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins except mecillinam (MPC) were not so active showing the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneuminiae FMOX, CMX, cefixime (CFIX), IPM, CRMN and NFLX showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of surfactant on nitroblue tetrazolium reduction of polymorphonuclear leucocytes stimulated with type Ia group B streptococci.
AB  - Activation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) was investigated after incubation of adult human PMN and group B streptococci (GBS) type Ia with a type-specific polyclonal antiserum and a modified porcine surfactant (Curosurf). The level of oxidative metabolism of PMN was studied using a micromethod modification of the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test. GBS alone did not stimulate significant oxygen metabolite release from PMN, and incubation of PMN with surfactant alone resulted in decreased NBT reduction. After opsonization of GBS with a specific antibody, PMN were activated and the increased oxygen metabolite release was not suppressed when surfactant was added to the system. We conclude that the encapsulated GBS strain investigated needs opsonization with specific antibody to increase oxidative metabolism of PMN, and that incubation of PMN and opsonized GBS with surfactant does not interfere with NBT reduction.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the tetL gene and identification  of iso-ISS1 elements from Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1.
AB  - The tetracycline-resistance (TcR) determinant of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1 has been identified and located on a 2.2-kb RsaI-EcoRI fragment. The fragment was cloned in Escherichia coli, and specified TcR in this host. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1374 bp, designated tetL. The nt sequence of tetL from pJH1 was identical to that of the tetL present on pLS1 from Streptococcus agalactiae. Upstream of the pJH1 tetL, part of another ORF was found that, except for two single-nt substitutions, was identical to an iso-ISS1 element from Lactococcus lactis. Hybridization studies indicated the presence of several ISS1-like elements in plasmid pJH1, but not on the En. faecalis chromosome. To study its usefulness as a marker in Gram+ organisms, the pJH1 tetL was cloned on the broad-host-range plasmid pNZ124, resulting in pNZ280, that was found to give resistance to 40 micrograms Tc/ml in Lc. lactis and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - [Udder disinfection and mastitis in cattle: a literature review].
AB  - Postmilking teat disinfection is accepted as an important part of standard preventive measures against mastitis in dairy cattle. The efficacy of postmilking teat disinfection against infections with contagious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae is beyond doubt. However, the efficacy of teat disinfection against infections with environmental pathogens such as Escherichia coli is disputed, and a negative effect has even been described in some situations. This article reviews the practice of teat disinfection in dairy cattle. Premilking and postmilking teat disinfection are discussed, as is the efficacy, different ways of teat disinfection, and different disinfectants. It is concluded that post-milking teat disinfection is an effective management measure in most herds. Selection of teat disinfectants should be based on proven efficacy, which is required for registration of the preparation as a veterinary medical product in the Netherlands.
TI  - Ability of normal vaginal flora to produce detectable phosphatidylglycerol in amniotic fluid in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if bacteria are capable of producing phosphatidylglycerol in amniotic fluid (AF) and the number of colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria necessary to produce this result. METHODS: Eleven species of bacteria and one species of yeast, common to the female genital tract and implicated in chorioamnionitis, were selected. Amniotic fluid was collected from 21 women and inoculated with 10(8) CFU/mL of each isolate. Aliquots of AF were tested at 0, 4, 12, and 24 hours for colony counts and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol by thin-layer chromatography. RESULTS: The mean gestational age (+/- standard deviation) of the 21 study patients was 33 weeks and 1 day (+/- 4 weeks). Among the 12 species studied, Escherichia coli produced phosphatidylglycerol, at a concentration of 1.75 x 10(8) CFU/mL, beginning 12 hours after incubation. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli is capable of producing phosphatidylglycerol in AF in vitro and is present in the vagina in 24% of normal pregnant patients. Our findings question the validity of using vaginal pool AF specimens for phosphatidylglycerol determination. Therefore, we recommend that patients presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes be evaluated by amniocentesis to determine fetal lung maturity with phosphatidylglycerol and the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio.
TI  - Group B Streptococcus and E. coli LPS-induced NO-dependent hyporesponsiveness to  noradrenaline in isolated intrapulmonary arteries of neonatal piglets.
AB  - 1. The effects of endotoxin (E. coli lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and heat inactivated group B Streptococcus (GBS) were studied on the contractile responses to noradrenaline (NA) in isolated pulmonary arteries and on the activity of the constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in lung fragments of neonatal piglets. 2. Short-term (< or = 5 h) incubation with LPS (1 micrograms ml-1) or GBS (3 x 10(7) colonies forming units ml-1) did not modify the vascular responsiveness to NA (10(-8) M-10(-4) M) in isolated intrapulmonary arteries. However, long-term incubation (20 h) with LPS or GBS produced a significant reduction in the maximal contractile responses and shifted the concentration-response curve for NA downwards. 3. Endothelium removal or the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor meclofenamate (10(-5) M) did not affect the GBS- and LPS-induced hyporesponsiveness to NA. 4. The presence of the nitric oxide (NO) precursor, L-arginine (10(-5) M), 30 min prior to the contractility challenge increased the LPS- and GBS-induced pulmonary vascular hyporesponsiveness to NA. In contrast, the addition, prior to the challenge with NA, of the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10(-4) M) or coincubation with dexamethasone (3 x 10(-6) M), a potent inhibitor of the induction of NOS, or with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10(-5) M) completely restored the reactivity to NA in LPS- and GBS-treated pulmonary arteries. 5. The incubation for 20 h of lung fragments with LPS and GBS produced a significant increase in the Ca2+-independent (inducible) NOS activity determined by the conversion of radiolabelled L-arginine to citrulline, but did not modify the constitutive NOS activity. This NOS induction was abolished by coincubation with dexamethasone (3 X 10-6 M).6. These results demonstrated that prolonged incubation with GBS and LPS causes an induction of NOS activity which results in a reduced vascular responsiveness to NA in pulmonary arteries of neonatal piglets. Thus, induction of NOS seems to be responsible for the delayed pulmonary vascular hyporesponsiveness induced by GBS (a Gram-positive) and E. coli (a Gram-negative), the most common causal agents of neonatal sepsis.
TI  - [Puerperal endometritis: study of 52 clinically and microbiologically diagnosed cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND: To know the epidemiologic features, clinical manifestations and etiology of puerperal endometritis in our environment in addition to the use of endometrial cultures in the microbiologic diagnosis of this infection. METHODS: A retrospective study of 52 cases of puerperal endometritis, clinically and microbiologically diagnosed over a 4-year period. RESULTS: Fifty percent of patients had undergone a cesarean, 36.5% presented puerperal anemia and 23% presented upper amniorrhexis at 12 hours. All the patients presented puerperal fever greater than 38 degrees C, 46% uterine subinvolution and 24% fetid lochia. The most frequently isolated microorganisms in the endometrial aspirate were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides spp. The association of ampicillin plus cefoxitine and clindamycin plus tobramycin presented in vitro efficacy in more than 85% of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The practice of endometrial aspirate and blood cultures in patients suspected of having puerperal endometritis effectively contributes to the diagnosis and treatment of this infection.
TI  - [Evidence of antimicrobial activity of the follicular fluid: an evaluation and analytical study of samples obtained in an assisted reproduction program].
AB  - Due to lack of evidence of infection in patients for ovarian punction for ovular  capture, the hypothesis of possible antibacterial action that could exist in follicular fluid, was evaluated. One hundred and ten samples of such fluid, were taken for antibacterial analysis, 37 of which, were studied, as they were the clearest ones and not contaminated. Such samples were obtained from hyperstimulated patients, ready for ovular capture through vagina by ultrasonographic guide. A bacterial inoculum, was prepared, in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of follicular fluid against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. agalactiae, L. monocytogenes and C. albicans. Counting of bacterial colonies, at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Results summary shows bacteriostatic activity in all studied colonies, and E. coli and S. agalactiae seem to be the most sensitive, followed by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes; and still present in C. albicans. It is concluded that follicular fluid has an antibacterial action, probably selective; and that keeping this research line will confirm this finding, and possibly will determine the concerned factors.
TI  - Bacterial concentration and blood volume required for a positive blood culture.
AB  - We attempted to define the minimum blood volume and bacterial concentration required to obtain a positive blood culture with the use of placental blood and an in vitro technique. Known amounts of either Escherichia coli or group B beta-hemolytic streptococci were added to heparinized placental blood specimens. Blood samples of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 ml containing bacteria were inoculated into 30 ml of a commercially available broth culture medium, incubated for 24 hours, and examined for bacterial growth. Samples of at least 0.25 ml blood containing more than 10 colony-forming units of bacteria per milliliter resulted in a positive blood culture for 131 of 132 samples. On the basis of these data, we suggest that if 0.25 ml of blood is sampled and the specimen contains more than 10 colony-forming units per milliliter of E. coli or group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, the blood culture is almost certain to be positive.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relations between udder infection and somatic cells in camel (camelus dromedarius) milk.
AB  - Quarter milk samples (n = 391) from 101 camels were examined to study the occurrence and causes of mastitis in traditionally managed camels in eastern Sudan and to evaluate the value of the California Mastitis Test (CMT), somatic cell count (SCC) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the detection of subclinical mastitis in the camel. One hundred and seventy (43.5%) of the quarter milk samples yielded pathogenic bacteria. Streptococcus agalactiae, other Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Escherichia coli were isolated from milk. Thirty-two (8.2%) quarter milk samples yielded mixed cultures, and 189 (48.3%) yielded no growth. Mean values for CMT, SCC and ATP were higher for quarters infected with major pathogens. However, a significant number of quarter milk samples had elevated values in these tests but were from quarters from which no bacteria were isolated. The ability of the tests to predict a positive bacteriology increased slightly when 2 or 3 tests were combined.
TI  - Group B streptococci (GBS) injure lung endothelium in vitro: GBS invasion and GBS-induced eicosanoid production is greater with microvascular than with pulmonary artery cells.
AB  - Neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis and pneumonia cause lung endothelial  cell injury. GBS invasion of the lung endothelium may be a mechanism for injury and the release of vasoactive eicosanoids. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) and lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMvEC) were isolated from neonatal piglets and were characterized as endothelial on the basis of morphology, uptake of acyl low-density lipoprotein, factor VIII staining, and formation of tube-like structures on Matrigel. PAEC and LMvEC monolayers were infected with COH-1 (parent GBS strain), isogenic mutants of COH-1 devoid of capsular sialic acid or all capsular polysaccharide, or a noninvasive Escherichia coli strain, DH5 alpha. Intracellular GBS were assayed by plate counting of colony-forming units resistant to incubation with extracellular antibiotics. All GBS strains invaded LMvEC significantly more than PAEC, showing that the site of lung endothelial cell origin influences invasion. DH5 alpha was not invasive in either cell type. Both isogenic mutants invaded PAEC and LMvEC more than COH-1 did, showing that GBS capsular polysaccharide attenuates invasion. Live GBS caused both LMvEC and PAEC injury as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release; heat-killed GBS and DH5 alpha caused no significant injury. Supernatants from PAEC and LMvEC were assayed by radioimmunoassay for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), and the thromboxane metabolite thromoxane B2. At 4 h, live COH-1 caused no significant increases in eicosanoids from both PAEC and LMvEC. At 16 h, live COH-1, but not heat-killed COH-1, caused a significant increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha greater than PGE2 from LMvEC, but not PAEC. We conclude that live GBS injure and invade the lung microvascular endothelium and induce release of prostacyclin and PGE2. We postulate that GBS invasion and injury of the lung microvasculature contribute to the pathogenesis of GBS disease.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the gene for group B streptococcal hyaluronate lyase.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are a major cause of serious human perinatal infections. Most clinical isolates of GBS secrete hyaluronate lyase, and production of high levels of the enzyme has been associated with strain virulence. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed on the basis of the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides prepared from the purified enzyme, permitted the polymerase chain reaction amplification from GBS chromosomal DNA of a 363-base pair internal DNA fragment of the GBS hyaluronate lyase gene (hylB). This DNA fragment was used as a probe to screen a lambda phage library of GBS chromosomal DNA fragments. Sequence analysis of positive clones identified an open reading frame capable of coding for a 111-kDa protein. Since no single clone was found to contain the entire gene it was necessary to reconstruct the gene from two plasmids containing inserts with suitable overlapping sequences. When this reconstructed gene was transformed into Escherichia coli, high level expression of hyaluronate lyase activity was obtained.
TI  - Characterization of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase of group B streptococci.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide is a critical virulence factor for group B streptococci associated with human infections, yet little is known about capsule biosynthesis. We detected CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase, the enzyme which activates N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, or sialic acid) for transfer to the nascent capsular polysaccharide, in multiple group B streptococcus serotypes, all of which elaborate capsules containing Neu5Ac. CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase isolated from a high-producing type Ib strain was purified 87-fold. The enzyme had apparent Km values of 7.6 for Neu5Ac and 1.4 for CTP and a pH optimum of 8.3 to 9.4, required magnesium, and was stimulated by dithiothreitol. This is the first characterization of an enzyme involved in group B streptococcus capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis.
TI  - Opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - Several standard intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) products are available in the United States and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. We evaluated more than 100 lots of IVIG, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. Neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in these preparations for Staphylococcus epidermidis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia, Ib, Ia/c, II and III; and Escherichia coli (K1). Pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. Within an IVIG lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains or serotypes of the same organism. Opsonic activity was significantly (P < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing method. We conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an IVIG lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. Clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of IVIG products by lot are known. In the future neonatal IVIG research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the cfb gene encoding group B streptococcal CAMP-factor.
AB  - An internal fragment of the cfb gene from group B streptococcal (GBS) strain R268 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate primers with sequences derived from the CAMP-factor amino acid (aa) sequence of GBS strain NCTC8181 [Ruhlmann et al. (1988) FEBS Lett 235:262-266]. After cloning and sequencing this fragment, the remainder of cfb and the adjacent 5' and 3' sequences were amplified by inverted PCR of genomic DNA and directly sequenced from the PCR product. Within the 1560 bp sequenced, a complete cfb gene deviating in two deduced aa residues from the published sequence was identified. In addition, the cfbR268 sequence contained a 29-aa leader peptide. Using primers directed to the 5' and 3' ends of cfb for PCR, a cfb gene of uniform size could be detected in 19 clinical GBS isolates including three phenotypically CAMP-negative strains. Utilizing Northern blot analysis and primer extension assays, the cfbR268 promoter was located and the length of the cfb transcript was assessed at about 1100 bp. In a parallel experiment, no cfb transcript could be detected from the CAMP-negative GBS strain 74-360. The complete cfbR268 gene and different portions of its 5' and 3' ends were cloned into the plasmid pJLA602 and expressed in E. coli DH5 alpha. The recombinant peptides could be detected by Western immunoblots with polyclonal antiserum. Only the full-sized recombinant CAMP-factor was found to exert co-hemolytic activity in a sheep-blood agar assay. This co-hemolytic activity could be inhibited by anti-CAMP antiserum.
TI  - [Epidemiology of primary bacterial meningitis].
AB  - In industrialized countries, the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis is between 5 and 10 cases/10(5) population/year. The highest age-specific attack rates are recorded between 0 and 2 years of age and can reach 100 cases/10(5) population/year or more in some countries. In this range of age, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli are responsible for meningitis in neonates whereas Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae cause meningitis in children older than 1 month. H. influenzae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children but its incidence has declined since the introduction of routine childhood immunization with conjugate vaccines. N. meningitidis is the leading cause of meningitis in teenagers and young adults, whereas S. pneumoniae is responsible for most of meningitis in the elderly. Prognosis of bacterial meningitis mainly depends on the type of causative organism and on the age of onset. Detailed epidemiologic features of Haemophilus, meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis are provided.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - Neonatal meningitis in England and Wales: a review of routine national data.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe trends in neonatal meningitis in England and Wales during the years 1975-91. Laboratory reports and, for the years 1983-91, data on statutory notifications and deaths from neonatal meningitis were reviewed. The mean annual total of laboratory reports of neonatal bacterial meningitis 1975-91 was 109 cases (range 69-133) with a slight upward trend apparent in the latter half of the study period. The mean annual number of reports of neonatal viral meningitis was only 14 cases with no trend apparent. The leading bacteria isolated were group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes accounting for 34.1%, 28.5%, and 6.8% of reports, respectively. There was a change in the pattern of causative bacteria from 1981 onwards with the group B streptococcus displacing E coli as the leading cause. With respect to neonatal viral meningitis, echoviruses and coxsackie viruses accounted for 55.4% and 38.6% of cases, respectively. Neonatal meningitis was seriously undernotified; the ratio of laboratory reported cases to cases notified ranged from 12:1 in 1985 to 4:1 in 1989. The annual numbers of deaths ranged from 18 to 39. The laboratory reporting system provided the most useful data on secular trends and causative organisms for neonatal meningitis. The slight upward trend in the number of reports of bacterial meningitis merits continued surveillance.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Clinical usefulness of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen studies.
AB  - A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate the effect that positive results of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen tests had on the care of patients with presumed bacterial meningitis. Of 901 tests ordered, costing $26,000 per year, 29 showed positive results--and only four of these affected patient care. By using cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen testing only when another test does not identify an organism, or in an attempt to determine central nervous system infection late in therapy for presumed sepsis, one can greatly reduce costs with no detrimental effect on patients.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The effects of nonclassic pediatric bacterial pathogens on the usefulness of the  Directigen latex agglutination test.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are classically the predominant meningeal pathogens of children. The Directigen latex agglutination test identifies these pathogens by detecting specific antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine. The authors tested 1151 specimens from 791 children with suspected meningeal infections. They found that the sensitivity of the Directigen test for detecting the five classic CSF pathogens of children was 83.3% with CSF and 60% with urine specimens. In detecting all pathogens, however, the sensitivity was only 50% with CSF and 37.5% with urine. Thus, an increased prevalence of nonclassic pathogens in a pediatric population adversely affects the efficacy of the Directigen test for confirming a diagnosis of meningitis and emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the clinical history and other routine CSF tests.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Streptococcus agalactiae with plasmid DNA.
AB  - A protocol for efficient electrotransformation of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) Lancefield's strain O90R (NTCT 9993) (an unencapsulated derivative of type Ia strain O90) was developed. The Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector pDP28 (7.8 kb) carrying the ermB gene for resistance to erythromycin was used as donor DNA. Frozen 'electrocompetent' cells were prepared by repeated washes in 10% glycerol. A 50-microliters aliquot containing about 5 x 10(9) colony forming units of bacteria was subjected to the electric pulse. Optimal conditions for electrotransformation were determined using different media, harvesting cells at different points of the growth curve, and using different field strengths. The dose-response curve for transformation of S. agalactiae with pDP28 showed one-hit kinetics as donor DNA varied between 0.01 and 3 micrograms. The efficiency of electrotransformation for this range of amounts of donor DNA was 1.2 x 10(4) cfu micrograms-1. The transformation frequencies obtained with this electroporation protocol are high enough to allow both subcloning and shotgun cloning of streptococcal DNA in S. agalactiae.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.

AB  
TI  - Risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with group B streptococcal urinary infections or urinary antibodies to group B streptococcal and E. coli antigens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish whether there is an association between preterm delivery  and either group B streptococcal urinary infection or the presence of urinary antibodies to group B streptococcal or E. coli antigens. DESIGN: A prospective study with urine culture and antibody measurement performed at the first antenatal visit and at 28 weeks gestation. SETTING: Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. SUBJECTS: Two thousand and forty-three women registering consecutively at an antenatal clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation. RESULTS: No increase in preterm delivery was observed in women with positive urine cultures for group B streptococci either at booking or at 28 weeks, even when confirmed by positive repeat cultures. Preterm delivery was more common in women with elevated urinary antibodies to E. coli antigens at booking (relative risk 1.81, 95% CI 1.22-2.68, P = 0.005) and at 28 weeks (relative risk 2.36, 95% CI 1.60-3.48, P < 0.0001) and to group B streptococcal antigens at 28 weeks (relative risk 2.24, 95% CI 1.46-3.43, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support previous reports that positive urine cultures for group B streptococci are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. Our report of an association between elevated levels of urinary antibodies and preterm delivery is a new finding consistent with the possibility that a local inflammatory response to uro-genital infection may be important in stimulating the onset of preterm labour. The results suggest that screening for urinary antibodies at 28 weeks gestation might help to identify a group of women at increased risk of prematurity.
TI  - PCR primers and probes for the 16S rRNA gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A set of broad-range PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the PCR product. The first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a Bacteroides-Flavobacterium probe, and two probes for other gram-negative species. The second series was designed to detect PCR products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The third series was designed for the detection of DNA from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The primers amplified DNA from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. Southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being Deinococcus radiopugnans and Gardnerella vaginalis. The gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria, Alloiococcus otitis and Rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by Gram stain characteristics. The CSF pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. Testing of the CSF pathogen and contaminant probes against DNA from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in CSF.
TI  - The promiscuous plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 from gram-positive bacteria encode complementary resolution functions.
AB  - pIP501 and pAM beta 1 are promiscuous plasmids from gram-positive bacteria which  carry structurally and genetically related replication functions (L. Janniere, A. Gruss and S.D. Ehrlich, 1993, in "Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics (A.L. Sonenshein, J.A. Hoch, and R. Losick, Eds.), pp. 625-644). We report here the sequence of a approximately 1 kb region located downstream of the pIP501 minimal replicon. This region is 82% homologous to the corresponding region of pAM beta 1 and encodes a resolution system which complements that of pAM beta 1. Additionally, we present evidence that the structural similarity between the two plasmids extends for further approximately 2 kb, through a region which may encode a topoisomerase protein in pAM beta 1.
TI  - [Therapy of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in lactating dairy cows using intra-mammary Sulphamycin (Polfa, PR)].
AB  - Sulphamycin (Polfa, Poland) is an intramammary preparation for the treatment of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in dairy cows. Its effects were observed in 141 dairy cows treated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The animals were selected after clinical examination of the mammary gland and bacteriological examination of udder secreta. In 37 subclinically diseased cows the efficiency of treatment depended on the infectious agent and amounted to 85.2, 77.8, 73.3 and 60.0%, Streptococcus agalactiae beta-haemolytical Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium pyogenes being the respective pathogens. In 61 cows with acute mastitis the efficiency of the preparation reached 71.2, 78.3, 61.7 and 80.9% in the cases induced by S. agalactiae, beta-haemolytical Streptococci, S. aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Forty-three cows were treated for acute mastitis and concomitant alteration of the general health state; in these cases, S. agalactiae, S. aureus and E. coli were identified as the infectious agents and the respective therapeutic efficiency presented 62.5, 69.8 and 76.2%. S. agalactiae and beta-haemolytical Streptococci responded most sensitively to erythromycin whereas S. aureus and E. coli proved to be septrin- and streptomycin-sensitive, respectively.
TI  - [Biocenosis of the vagina and infection with Chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  - The authors have examined 379 women for infection by Chlamydia trachomatis, performing vaginal smears and routine bacterial cultures. C. trachomatis was discovered in 33.2% of the women, most frequently accompanied by erosion of the collum, cervicitis and CIN-Ca. Women with C. trachomatis had the following levels of vaginal purity: 1-44.4%, 2-23.0%, 3 and 4-29.4%, 3.2% -leukocytes only. Leukocytes were present in significantly more women with level 1 of vaginal purity than in the control group. Additional infections (Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli and Trichomonas vaginalis) were found in only a small percentage of women with C. trachomatis, just as in controls. The presence of leukocytes or level 1 of vaginal hygiene with leukocytes may favour C. trachomatis, just as in controls. The presence of leukocytes or level 1 of vaginal hygiene with leukocytes may favour C. trachomatis infection, therefore these cases should be subjected to a more thorough examination.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - Internal bacterial flora of solid uterine cervical cancer.
AB  - Twenty-five patients with uterine cervical cancer (Two cases stage O; four cases  stage Ia; five cases stage Ib; one case stage IIa; ten cases stage IIb; two cases stage IIIa; one case stage IVa) served as the subjects. The bacterial flora inside the cervical cancers was investigated using the optimal technique. There was mixed abnormal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in all subjects. The average number of bacterial species isolated from inside the cervical cancers was 6.3. The predominant bacteria isolated were the aerobes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis, and Prevotella bivia. As the stages of cervical cancer progressed, G. vaginalis, B. distasonis and P. bivia were detected at higher rates and higher counts than other bacteria. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between G. vaginalis, B. distasonis and P. bivia and the onset and growth of cervical cancer.
TI  - Adverse perinatal outcome and resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes and group B streptococcus carriage.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with  resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and group B streptococcus. METHODS: Maternal and neonatal records were reviewed of four cases in which adverse perinatal outcomes occurred from resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for either PROM or positive group B streptococcal cultures. Information on clinical setting, antibiotic usage, maternal and neonatal complications, and maternal and neonatal cultures was noted. RESULTS: All four cases were complicated by PROM at 25-35 weeks' gestation. Ampicillin or amoxicillin was used in several clinical settings, including therapeutically for the presence of group B streptococcus, presumptively for PROM, and prophylactically pending the results of group B streptococcal cultures. Clinical chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in all four cases, and in two cases the maternal course was prolonged and complicated by persistent fever and the need for therapy for pelvic vein thrombophlebitis. Two neonates died from fulminant clinical sepsis. A third infant, one of a twin gestation, was stillborn, presumably because of sepsis. In three cases, neonatal and placental cultures revealed Escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin; in the fourth case, Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, with only intermediate sensitivity to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: Resistant Enterobacteriaceae associated with adverse perinatal outcomes may result from the use of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, after PROM. In deciding whether antibiotic therapy for PROM or group B streptococcal prophylaxis is appropriate, the value of purported benefits must be weighed against presumably infrequent but serious outcomes, including neonatal sepsis and death due to selection or overgrowth of resistant organisms.
TI  - Infections of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: approach to management.
AB  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are being used with increasing frequency  for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Nevertheless, no guidelines exist for the management of infections of these devices. We report our experience with infections of these devices and review the English-language literature. In all cases, patients presented with local signs of generator infection; systemic signs of infection and bacteremia were often absent. Most infections are due to staphylococcus. Risk factors for the development of infection include placement of the device via median sternotomy during another cardiac surgical procedure, reoperation, and intercurrent infection at another site. Infections are most reliably treated with full explantation of the device and antibiotics. In rare cases, patients may respond to a combination of intravenous antibiotics and removal and replacement of only the generator.
TI  - Gram-negative meningitis and chronic constipation: an unusual presentation of caudal regression syndrome.
AB  - Congenital malformations may present as meningitis caused by enteric organisms, but this is extremely rare and occurs almost exclusively in the paediatric population. We report an unusual case of a young man with chronic constipation presenting with spontaneous Gram-negative meningitis due to an underlying congenital spinal malformation known as the caudal regression syndrome.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Neonatal bacterial septicemia in a tropical area. Four-year experience in Guadeloupe (French West Indies).
AB  - During a four-year study (1987-1990) at the Neonatal Department, University Hospital Pointe-a-Pitre (French West Indies), blood culture was systematically performed on all admitted newborns. The incidence of septicemia was 48 of 1000 admissions and 8.9 of 1000 inborn live births. Among the 107 neonatal positive blood cultures, group B streptococcus accounted for 37% of blood culture isolates and was the most frequent cause of septicemia. The overall mortality rate was 8.4%. The incidence of neonatal bacterial septicemia was among the high rates reported in the literature. The incidence of neonatal bacterial septicemia is discussed as a public health problem in perinatology in Guadeloupe in spite of good medical care. A review of the literature on bacterial septicemia in tropical or developing countries compared to the Guadeloupean experience allows speculation that this problem might be underestimated in third world countries.
TI  - Evaluation of 57 teat sanitizers using excised cow teats.
AB  - Fifty-seven teat dip formulations were tested for germicidal activity with an excised teat assay. Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 27956), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29740), and Escherichia coli+ (a wild strain isolated from an Ohio cow 2956RR during the dry period) were used. Log reductions ranged from 5.6480 to 1.8330 for Strep. agalactiae compared with undipped controls. Staphylococcus aureus were reduced from 4.8972 to 1.0102. Escherichia coli were reduced from 5.8677 to 1.1450. The percentages of the products tested that had log reductions < 3 against Strep. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and E. coli were 24, 30, and 61. Four teat dip formulations contained 4% sodium hypochlorite; all were effective against Strep. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and E. coli. The three formulations containing glutaraldehyde were effective against the three mastitis pathogens. Formulations containing 1 and .5% iodine were not consistently effective against Strep. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, or E. coli. Teat sanitizers containing .5% chlorhexidine also showed inconsistency. Variations in formulation for products containing iodine or chlorhexidine affected germicidal activity.
TI  - Radiotelemetry temperature responses of mammary gland and body to intramammary injection of Escherichia coli endotoxin or Streptococcus agalactiae in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - To investigate the feasibility of using changes in body or mammary temperature to detect mastitis, radiotransmitters were implanted midway between rear udder quarters and in the peritoneal cavity of 5 Holstein cows (1 to 3 months in lactation) housed in an environmental chamber (16 +/- 2 C; lights on 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM). After a 6-week control period, Escherichia coli endotoxin (0.5 mg) was injected after the morning milking into left rear teat cisterns via the teat canal. Wisconsin mastitis test score and somatic cell count in all quarters increased significantly (P < 0.01) by the next milking. Effects were greatest in the endotoxin-exposed quarters. Milk yields for all quarters decreased significantly (P < 0.01) by the first milking after endotoxin injection. Udder and body temperatures at milkings were similar and were not affected by treatment. When temperatures were averaged for the 5 cows for each of 120 time points/d, average temperatures, relative to time of injection of endotoxin, were increased by 0.5 C above baseline at 2.75 hours, peaked at +2.9 C at 6.50 hours, and remained high through 9.25 hours after injection. Power spectra calculated for individual cows on a daily basis universally indicated an increase in power at low frequencies on the day of injection. Subsequently, Streptococcus agalactiae (200 colony-forming units) was injected into right rear teat cisterns. Wisconsin mastitis test score increased at the second milking after injection. Cell count and quarter milk yield decreased by the third milking. As with endotoxin, injection of S agalactiae could not be detected via a change in temperature at milkings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Costs of clinical mastitis and mastitis prevention in dairy herds.
AB  - A stratified random sample of 50 Ohio dairy herds, monitored for 1 year between March 1988 and May 1989, was used to estimate the component costs of clinical mastitis per cow-year overall and by organism, the component costs of an episode of clinical mastitis overall and by organism, and the incidence of clinical mastitis by organism. Each herd was visited monthly by a veterinarian who conducted on-farm interviews and completed standardized data-collection forms designed to elicit economic information about the on-farm costs of clinical mastitis and mastitis prevention. Producers collected milk samples prior to treatment of clinical mastitis cases. Culturing methods allowed identification of 18 specific mastitis pathogen classifications. Annual costs estimated were on a per cow-year and clinical episode basis. The monthly mean population of cows monitored was 4,068. Mastitis prevention cost $14.50/cow-year, whereas the cost incurred by producers because of clinical cases of mastitis was $37.91. Organisms prevalent in the cows' environment caused the most costly types of mastitis. Disregarding contaminated samples and episodes for which no milk samples were taken, mastitis for which 2 organisms were isolated accounted for 35.5% of costs of clinical mastitis, followed by cases for which Escherichia coli (21.3%) was isolated, cases for which culturing yielded no growth (8.6%), and cases for which esculin-positive Streptococcus spp (6.4%), Klebsiella spp (5.7%), esculin-negative CAMP-negative Streptococcus spp (5.1%), Enterobacter spp (4.8%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp (4.1%), coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp (3.0%), S agalactiae (2.5%), and Bacillus spp (1.2%) were isolated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Correlating infectious outcome with clinical parameters of 1130 consecutive febrile infants aged zero to eight weeks.
AB  - The study objectives were to characterize the infectious outcomes and associated  clinical parameters of a large group of febrile young infants who received outpatient sepsis evaluation. This retrospective review of consecutive cases during a seven-year period was set in an urban pediatric emergency department. Febrile infants, aged zero to eight weeks, were the participants. All received a standard evaluation for sepsis, including complete blood count/blood culture, lumbar puncture/cerebrospinal fluid culture, and urinalysis/urine culture. Of 1130 patients, 447 (42%) were aged zero to four weeks, and 683 (58%) were aged four to eight weeks. In 96 cases (8.5%), a bacterial pathogen was isolated by culture of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or stool; 58% were aged zero to four weeks and 42% were aged four to eight weeks. The rate of positive cultures per patient age was doubled in those aged zero to four weeks (12%) compared with those aged four to eight weeks (6%). The 49 cases of invasive bacterial infections (bacterial meningitis/bacteremia) were most commonly associated with lower degrees of fever, as slightly over one half (25/49) had temperature < 39 degrees C. The most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection were group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli, accounting for 33 of 49 cases (67%); the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection in older children (Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were relatively underrepresented, accounting for only five of these 49 (10%) cases.
TI  - Detection of bacterial antigens in milk samples from clinical cases of bovine mastitis in which culture is negative.
AB  - ELISAs to detect antigens against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis were developed and used on whey samples from quarter milk samples from cases of clinical mastitis in which no bacterial pathogen had been isolated by standard culture techniques. Antigens against one or other of the bacteria listed above were detected in 68 per cent of 84 samples. Fifty-one per cent of the 84 samples contained antigens to E coli. Antigens against one or other of these bacteria were also detected in 51 per cent of 53 quarter milk samples which were negative on culture but had somatic cell counts of more than 500,000 cells/ml. It is suggested that ELISAs for the detection of antigens in quarter milk samples could be a useful adjunct to culture, to determine the infection status of a quarter.
TI  - Group B streptococci invade endothelial cells: type III capsular polysaccharide attenuates invasion.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are the most common cause of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia. The pathogenesis of GBS disease is not completely defined. GBS-induced endothelial cell injury is suggested by histological findings at autopsy and in animal studies. We hypothesized that (i) type III GBS (COH-1) invade and injure human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells and (ii) isogenic mutations in GBS capsule synthesis would influence HUVE invasion. Confluent HUVE monolayers were infected for 0.5, 2, or 6 h. Media with penicillin plus gentamicin were added and incubated for 2 h to kill extracellular bacteria. Cells were washed and lysed, and the number of live intracellular bacteria was determined by plate counting. COH-1 invaded HUVE cells in a time-dependent manner at levels 1,000-fold higher than those of the noninvasive Escherichia coli strain but significantly lower than those of Staphylococcus aureus. There was no evidence for net intracellular replication of GBS within HUVE cells. COH-1 infection of HUVE cells caused the release of lactate dehydrogenase activity. GBS invasion was inhibited by cytochalasin D in a dose-dependent manner; GBS-induced lactate dehydrogenase release was attenuated by cytochalasin D. The isogenic strains COH 1-11, devoid of capsular sialic acid, and COH 1-13, devoid of all type III capsule, invaded HUVE cells three- to fivefold more than the parent COH-1 strain. The type III capsular polysaccharide and particularly the capsular sialic acid attenuate GBS invasion of HUVE cells. Electron micrographs of lung tissue from a GBS-infected newborn Macaca nemestrina also showed GBS within capillary endothelial cells. We conclude that endothelial cell invasion and injury are potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of GBS disease.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of the amniotic fluid during the last week of pregnancy].
AB  - Amnion fluid samples were obtained from 100 pregnant women in the last week of pregnancy just before in labor. In detecting of antibacterial effectiveness, S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. agalactiae ATCC 13813 strains were used. Antibacterial effectiveness of amnion fluid to these bacteria are found respectively as; 74%, 63% and 73.9%.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.

TI  - [Neonatal septicemia: incidence and risk factors].
AB  - The cases of 131 newborns with positive blood cultures have been reviewed. These  children were born in our hospital between 1985 and 1990. We found that the incidence of sepsis was 4.3/1000 newborns. Early neonatal sepsis was the most frequent, representing 58% of the cases. Late sepsis in hospitalized infants represented 1.34% of the cases. Streptococcus B was the microorganism most frequently isolated (26.7%), followed by S. epidermidis (19.8%), E. coli (13.7%) and S. aureus (10.68%). In over 50% of the cases of early sepsis, maternal-fetal risk factors were present. Mortality was 7.6%, with half of these cases due to Streptococcus B.
TI  - Characterization of the minimal origin required for replication of the streptococcal plasmid pIP501 in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - By using deletional analysis the origin of replication, oriR, of the streptococcal plasmid pIP501 in Bacillus subtilis has been mapped at a position immediately downstream of the repR gene. Determination of both the right and left border of oriR allowed the definition of a sequence of a maximum of 52 nucleotides which theoretically constitutes the minimal origin of replication. Recently, the start point of leading-strand synthesis of the closely related plasmid pAM beta 1 has been mapped at a position which is located exactly in the middle of this sequence (Bruand et al., 1991). The function of oriR did not depend on its location downstream of the repR gene. Translocation of oriR-containing fragments to other regions of the plasmid proved to be possible. The smallest translocated fragment that still reconstituted autonomous replication was 72bp in size. This fragment was also active in directing the replication of an Escherichia coli plasmid in B. subtilis when the RepR protein was supplied in trans from a repR gene integrated into the host chromosome. The transformation efficiency of plasmids carrying translocated oriR fragments showed a certain dependence on the fragment length and orientation. The DNA sequence of oriR included an inverted repeat, both branches of which appeared to be essential for oriR function. The repeats of oriR shared sequence similarity with a repeat located upstream of promoter pII, which has been suggested to be involved in autoregulation of repR expression.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - Large, identical, tandem repeating units in the C protein alpha antigen gene, bca, of group B streptococci.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the United States. The surface-associated C protein alpha antigen of GBS is thought to have a role in both virulence and immunity. We previously cloned the C protein alpha antigen structural gene (named bca for group B, C protein, alpha) into Escherichia coli. Western blots of both the native alpha antigen and the cloned gene product demonstrate a regularly laddered pattern of heterogeneous polypeptides. The nucleotide sequence of the bca locus reveals an open reading frame of 3060 nucleotides encoding a precursor protein of 108,705 Da. Cleavage of a putative signal sequence of 41 amino acids yields a mature protein of 104,106 Da. The 20,417-Da N-terminal region of the alpha antigen shows no homology to previously described protein sequences and is followed by a series of nine tandem repeating units that make up 74% of the mature protein. Each repeating unit is identical and consists of 82 amino acids with a molecular mass of 8665 Da, which is encoded by 246 nucleotides. The size of the repeating units corresponds to the observed size differences in the heterogeneous ladder of alpha C proteins expressed by GBS. The C-terminal region of the alpha antigen contains a membrane anchor domain motif that is shared by a number of Gram-positive surface proteins. The large region of identical repeating units in bca defines protective epitopes and may play a role in generating phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the alpha antigen.
TI  - Intravenous immune globulin therapy for early-onset sepsis in premature neonates.
AB  - Newborn infants may have IgG deficiencies that increase their susceptibility to bacterial infection. To determine whether intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy improves survival rates in early-onset sepsis, we prospectively entered 753 neonates (birth weight 500 to 2000 gm, gestation less than or equal to 34 weeks, age less than or equal to 12 hours) into a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial. Blood culture specimens were obtained and infants randomly assigned to receive 10 ml (per kilogram) intravenously of a selected IVIG (500 mg/kg) or albumin (5 mg/kg) preparation. Maternal and neonatal risk factors were not different between groups. Thirty-one babies (4.2%) had early-onset sepsis; the causative organisms were group B streptococcus (12 babies), Escherichia coli (6), and others (13). Of these 31 neonates, 7 (23%) died. Total serum IgG was higher for 7 days after IVIG therapy than after albumin treatment (p less than 0.05). During these 7 days, 5 (30%) of 17 albumin-treated and none of 14 IVIG-treated patients died (p less than 0.05). The survival rate at 56 days of age, however, was not significantly improved. Group B streptococcus type-specific IgG antibody was significantly increased after IVIG treatment and appeared to be related to the amount of IVIG specific antibody. Infusion-related adverse reactions were less frequent in patients receiving IVIG therapy (0.5%) than in those receiving albumin. The IVIG therapy in neonates with early-onset sepsis, while reducing the early mortality rate, did not significantly affect the overall survival rate. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to determine more effective therapeutic regimens.
TI  - Production of an electrolyte beverage from milk permeate.
AB  - The objective of this study was to prepare shelf-stable electrolyte beverages from milk permeate. The average composition of permeate was 4.59% total solids and .40% ash. Lactose was hydrolyzed (approximately 80%) with a commercial fungal lactase enzyme. Additional sweetness was provided by sucrose. The pH was reduced to 3.5 to 3.8 by the addition of citric acid. Shelf-stable products were made using four processes: 1) UHT followed by aseptic filling, 2) heating of filled bottles to 85 degrees C for 30 min, 3) addition of .05% benzoate, and 4) nanopore filtration. The mineral composition of the finished product, expressed in parts per million, was calcium, 150; phosphorus, 157; magnesium, 43; potassium, 1166; sodium, 286; iron, 17; copper, 8; and zinc, 3.4. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella dublin, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae grew well when they were inoculated into unacidified, hydrolyzed permeate. None of these organisms were isolated from properly processed products. A shelf-stable electrolyte beverage high in minerals was made from whole milk permeate. This beverage could be used to replace electrolytes lost from the human body. The production of a permeate beverage would help alleviate disposal problems of permeate.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics treatment of in vitro fertilized bovine embryos to remove adhering bacteria.
AB  
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - Pasteurella multocida chorioamnionitis from vaginal transmission.
AB  - A 21 year old primigravida with a twin pregnancy developed Pasteurella multocida  chorioamnionitis. Infection occurred at 27 weeks gestational age after prolonged rupture of membranes. The twin in the separate sac presenting proximal to the cervix suffered infection and died shortly after birth whereas the other twin was not infected. The bacterium is believed to have caused ascending infection from asymptomatic colonization of the vaginal tract.
TI  - In vitro germicidal activity of teat dips against Nocardia asteroides and other udder pathogens.
AB  - Nine commercial teat dip formulations containing 1.94% linear dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, or 1% available iodine from nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanol-iodine complex, or .5% chlorhexidine acetate were tested for contamination with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and their in vitro germicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Nocardia asteroides. All products were free of bacteria when neutralized samples were tested on blood agar or liquid thioglycollate media. To test for in vitro efficacy, each teat dip preparation was mixed with a suspension of one of the pathogenic test organisms containing 10(8) bacteria/ml (final concentration) for .5 to 15 min. Viable bacteria were evaluated by direct plating of neutralized aliquots and by filtration techniques. All products were effective against E. coli, Staph. aureus, and Strep. agalactiae. With N. asteroides, the direct plating method gave equivocal results. The filtration experiments indicated that all teat dips containing dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid and nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanol-iodine complex were effective against all four pathogens. Three of the teat dips containing chlorhexidine acetate were ineffective against N. asteroides. The fourth teat dip, containing chlorhexidine acetate and an emollient, was partially effective.
TI  - Effects of intrauterine infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin in normal cows and in cows with endometritis induced by experimental infection with Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Two experiments were carried out to describe the effects of intrauterine infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin on some aspects of nonspecific uterine defense mechanisms in healthy cyclic cows (Experiment 1) and in cows with induced endometritis by experimental infection with Streptococcus agalactiae (Experiment 2). In Experiments 1 and 2, the mean log(e) total white cell counts (>95% neutrophils) in the uterine flushing fluid of the endotoxin-treated group were significantly increased (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). Streptococcus agalactiae was detected by the Latex Agglutination Test (LAT) in 47% of the samples from uteri experimentally infected with this organism; 12.5% were positive on culture, and only 10% were positive on both tests. With one exception, all the samples with a positive culture were positive to the LAT, but not all samples submitted to the LAT had positive culture. There was a significant (P<0.05) association between endotoxin treatment and the presence of infection detected by the LAT but not with that detected by culture (P>0.05) at 3 to 12 days post infection. Similar results were found at 8 to 16 days post infection. The infection disappeared from the endotoxin-treated group but not from the non-treated group 12 days after the induction of infection. It is concluded that intrauterine E. coli endotoxin infusion might provide an alternative treatment for those cows with endometritis that is refractory to conventional antimicrobial and hormonal therapy. It is also concluded that the LAT is an easier, quicker and more reliable method than bacterial culture for the detection of endometritis caused by Strep. agalactiae , and, possibly, such immunodiagnostic tests may be useful for the detection of other uterine infections.
TI  - Heterologous gene expression in Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis and other gastrointestinal tract Bacteroides are unusual gram-negative eubacteria in that genes from other gram-negative eubacteria are not expressed when introduced into these organisms. To analyze gene expression in Bacteroides, expression vector and promoter probe (detection) vector systems were developed. The essential feature of the expression vector was the incorporation of a Bacteroides insertion sequence element, IS4351, which possesses promoter activity directed outward from its ends. Genes inserted into the multiple cloning site downstream from an IS4351 DNA fragment were readily expressed in B. fragilis. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) structural gene from Tn9 was tested and conferred chloramphenicol resistance on B. fragilis. Both chloramphenicol resistance and CAT activity were shown to be dependent on the IS4351 promoters. Similar results were obtained with the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene (uidA) but activity was just 30% of the levels seen with cat. Two tetracycline resistance determinants, tetM from Streptococcus agalactiae and tetC from E. coli, also were examined. tetC did not result in detectable tetracycline resistance but the gram-positive tetM gene conferred high-level resistance to tetracycline and minocycline in Bacteroides hosts. Based on the cat results, promoter probe vectors containing the promoterless cat gene were constructed. These vectors were used to clone random B. fragilis promoters from partial genomic libraries and the recombinants displayed a range of CAT activities and chloramphenicol MICs in B. fragilis hosts. In addition, known E. coli promoters (Ptet, Ptac, Ptrc, Psyn, and P1P2rrnB) were tested for activity in B. fragilis. No chloramphenicol resistance or CAT activity was observed in B. fragilis with these promoters.
TI  - The changing spectrum of neonatal meningitis over a fifteen-year period.
AB  - One hundred seventy-seven cases of neonatal meningitis treated at the University  of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston over a 15-year period (1974-1988) were reviewed. Over this period, the incidence of bacterial meningitis decreased, the incidence of aseptic meningitis remained stable, and the diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis increased in frequency. During 1984-1988, enterovirus was the most common cause of meningitis in neonates older than seven days and accounted for one third of all cases of neonatal meningitis. Half of all neonates with bacterial meningitis had negative blood cultures. We recommend that 1) diagnostic lumbar puncture remain part of the routine assessment of the neonate with suspected sepsis, and 2) CSF be cultured for enterovirus as well as for bacteria when a neonate older than seven days presents with suspected sepsis.
TI  - The potential use of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutic modalities in neonatal  infection.
AB  
TI  - Adherence and colonization by bacterial pathogens in explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue.
AB  - Explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue taken from virgin heifers were used to  examine adherence, colonization and cytopathogenesis of Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in the putative target tissue. None of the five bacteria was able to adhere to healthy ductular epithelium but all showed a marked tropism for exposed connective tissue. S. aureus and E. coli induced a marked cytopathic effect in ductular epithelium after 6 hours in culture but the bacteria were not in close association with the affected tissue. No evidence could be found to support the hypothesis that adherence to epithelium might be the first stage in the pathogenesis of mastitis caused by these organisms.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  - Flomoxef sodium (FMOX) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). Serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. Serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml) and N.D. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. FMOX was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected, and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. In 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. The bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of Escherichia coli, and 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". Moreover, the drug, administered with or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. No side effects were observed in any of the patients. Concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in GOT were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. The results suggest that FMOX is useful and safe also in neonates.
TI  - Direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a DNA probe.
AB  - This study involved the rapid, direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (BACTEC, Johnston Laboratories, Inc.) by using the AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) culture confirmation test. This method uses a chemiluminescent DNA probe that detects the rRNA of the target organisms. The manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. Two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. The first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml) from the blood culture bottle. The second method used a microcentrifuge and less volume (1 to 1.5 ml). A total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by AccuProbe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. The microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. When combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the AccuProbe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of RU29246 (HR916 metabolite) compared with four other oral beta-lactams tested against more than 5000 clinical isolates.
AB  - The activity of RU29246, the active metabolite of the oral cephalosporin ester HR916, was compared in a multicenter study with that of the four oral beta-lactam antibiotics cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanate (amoxicillin/CA). RU29246 was generally 2- to 8-fold more active than the other oral cephalosporins and comparable to amoxicillin/CA against staphylococci, and was the most active cephalosporin against group B streptococci. All four cephalosporins were ineffective against enterococci. RU29246 was the only cephalosporin consistently active against Acinetobacter, but all beta-lactam antibiotics had poor activity against Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia. RU29246 was comparable to cefixime and more active than the other cephalosporins against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, all of the antibiotics had poor activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Quality control reference ranges for the quality control organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 are proposed for the broth dilution method based on data derived from this multicenter study.
TI  - Effect of milking without pulsation on teat duct colonization with Streptococcus  agalactiae and penetrability to endotoxin.
AB  - Forty quarters of 10 cows were milked for a 9-d period with one of four treatments: 1) no liner pulsation, 2) conventional milking, 3) no pulsation for 4 d followed by conventional milking for 5 d, and 4) conventional milking for 4 d followed by milking without pulsation for 5 d. All teat orifices were inoculated with approximately .5 million cfu of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae on d 1 and 5. Recoveries of Strep. agalactiae from the teat end were increased for teats milked without pulsation. Recoveries of Strep. dysgalactiae were lower than those of Strep. agalactiae and not increased by milking without pulsation. In a second experiment, teats of 20 cows were milked for a 15-d period with or without liner pulsation. For 10 successive milkings, all teats were inoculated with 1.0 micrograms of Escherichia coli endotoxin either immediately or 2.5 h after each milking. The frequency of endotoxin penetration, measured by the Wisconsin Mastitis Test, in pulsated quarters and in nonpulsated quarters was similar. For quarters milked without pulsation but not for pulsated quarters, inoculation of endotoxin immediately after milking led to greater incidence of teat duct penetration than for inoculation 2.5 h after milking.
TI  - Bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  - During delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. Due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells of respiratory nasal mucosa. Bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. Bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. In mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. Results of the study performed by usual methods revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. Gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.
TI  - Early response in septicemia in newborns and their mothers. Effect of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and tumor necrosis factor on lactoferrin release and the generation of tissue thromboplastin.
AB  - Using a whole blood in vitro model, we have investigated the effect of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci, GBS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) on the generation of lactoferrin (LF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) and tissue thromboplastin (TPL) in healthy newborns at term and their mothers. E. coli (at a final concentration of 10(7)/ml) significantly increased the release of LF in whole blood from newborns after 20 as well as 60 min stimulation, and in samples from their mothers after 60 min stimulation. A significant increase in the release of LF was observed in both newborns and their mothers after 20 and 60 min stimulation with TNF (at a final concentration of 1000 pg/ml). A combination of TNF/E. coli or TNF/GBS never gave any significant additional stimulatory effect. After stimulation with E. coli or GBS (both at a final concentration of 10(7)/ml) for 60 min a significant increase in production of TNF and TPL was observed in newborns. In newborns a significant increase in production of TNF and TPL was observed also after 20 min stimulation with E. coli. TNF (at a final concentration of 1000 pg/ml) significantly increased the generation of TPL after 20 and 60 min stimulation in both groups. There was a tendency for a greater release of LF and generation of TNF and TPL in samples from newborns compared with their mothers, but the differences were not statistically significant. E. coli, GBS and TNF had no significant effect on the production of IL-1.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810, CPR), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma and urinary levels of CPR were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. Average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. Average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. The results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with CPR were investigated. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of 49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. These results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. These levels appear to be higher than MIC90 values against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. CPR was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. Evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute UTI, totalling 61 cases. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 38 cases, good in 22 cases and fair in 1 case with an efficacy rete of 98.4% (excellent + good).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular characterization of an IgA receptor from group B streptococci: sequence of the gene, identification of a proline-rich region with unique structure and isolation of N-terminal fragments with IgA-binding capacity.
AB  - Certain strains of group B streptococci express a cell surface protein that binds IgA and acts as a virulence factor. This IgA receptor is referred to here as protein Bac. The gene for protein Bac was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the complete nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of 1134 residues includes a signal sequence of 37 amino acids and a putative membrane anchor region at the C-terminal end. The processed form of the receptor, 1097 residues, has a calculated molecular weight of 123,786. There are no cysteines in protein Bac, suggesting a fibrillar structure. The C-terminal half of the protein includes a 90 residues long region with a novel type of periodic structure, the "XPZ motif", in which every third amino acid is proline. Unlike other bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins, there are no long repeats in protein Bac. Clones which express only part of the protein Bac gene were used to show that IgA-binding takes place in the N-terminal part of the molecule. Protein Bac was originally described as an antigen called beta, but N-terminal fragments that bind IgA do not react with a reference serum against the beta antigen. These and other data indicate that protein Bac can be divided into two regions with different functions: an N-terminal IgA-binding region and a C-terminal region corresponding to the beta antigen. The IgA-binding region of protein Bac does not show any homology to protein Arp, the IgA receptor from group A streptococci, although these receptors have similar binding properties. This indicates that convergent evolution has favored the appearance of these two structurally different streptococcal IgA receptors.
TI  - Cloned alpha and beta C-protein antigens of group B streptococci elicit protective immunity.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci [GBS]) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the United States. The surface-associated C proteins of GBS play a role in immunity, but their number, size, structure, function, and virulence properties have not been well characterized. A recombinant library of DNA fragments from GBS strain A909 (type Ia/C) was prepared in the plasmid pUX12, a specially constructed Escherichia coli expression vector. The library was screened with a rabbit antiserum shown to be protective for passive immunity to GBS infection in a mouse lethality model. Clones were divided into two distinct groups on the basis of DNA-DNA cross-hybridization, restriction enzyme analysis, and the expression of antigenic proteins in E. coli. A characteristic clone from each group was chosen for further study. Clone pJMS23 expresses gene products that biochemically and immunologically correspond to the trypsin-resistant, C-protein alpha antigen. Clone pJMS1 expresses a gene product that binds to immunoglobulin A and is similar to the trypsin-sensitive, C-protein beta antigen. Antisera raised in rabbits against E. coli containing each of the plasmid clones were able to elicit protective immunity in mice challenged by GBS strains carrying the C proteins but not by non-C-protein-bearing strains. Southern blot analysis shows no DNA homology between the clones, and there is no immunological cross-reactivity between the antigens they express. Therefore, pJMS23 and pJMS1 encode two different C proteins that define unique protective epitopes.
TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of daily tracheal aspirate cultures in predicting organisms causing bacteremia in ventilated neonates.
AB  - The sensitivity of daily tracheal aspirates in predicting neonatal bacteremia was ascertained from 48 of 354 ventilated neonates who became septic during a 4-year period. Fourteen babies (designated Group A) had a positive blood culture on the first day of life; 28 infants (Group B) and 6 infants (Group C) had bacteremia beyond the first day. Group C infants became septic as a result of intraabdominal pathology. Pathogens isolated from blood were correlated with those from preceding daily tracheal aspirates. The overall sensitivity of tracheal cultures in predicting results of blood cultures was 81% (Group A, 71%; Group B, 93%; Group C, 50%). The specificity of daily tracheal aspirates was ascertained from 28 of 50 ventilated infants who were nonseptic and had negative blood cultures during a 6-month period. Only 18 had consistently sterile tracheal aspirates (specificity, 64%). The mean number of days of intubation was 6.6 for the 10 false positive and 3.6 for the 18 true negative. Because of low positive predictive value (0.26) the role of daily tracheal aspirate culture is limited to providing early information regarding potential pathogens when sepsis occurs rather than to identify babies who are going to become septic.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - Can the nonstress test predict congenital sepsis?
AB  - The possible role of the nonstress test (NST) in the prediction of congenital sepsis in pregnancies complicated by prolonged premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) was investigated in a retrospective controlled study. Thirteen NSTs performed within 24 hours of the delivery of infants with congenital sepsis were coded, blinded, and mixed with an equal number of blinded NSTs derived from randomly selected patients matched for gestational age with PROM but without neonatal or maternal infection. Eleven of 13 infants with congenital sepsis had a reactive NST, and two had a nonreactive test. Among the controls, there were also 11 reactive and two nonreactive NSTs. The sensitivity and specificity of the NST in predicting congenital sepsis in patients with PROM were 15.4% and 84.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were 50%. Our results suggest that the NST is not a useful tool for prediction of congenital sepsis.
TI  - [Clinical features and evaluation of initial antibiotic treatment in 125 cases with purulent meningitis in infancy and childhood].
AB  - A survey of purulent meningitis in infancy and childhood from 1980 through 1986 was made by sending questionnaires to 32 pediatric institutions in Aichi, Gifu and Shizuoka prefectures. Case cards of 125 patients were collected and analyzed. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.78. The age distribution for all patients was as follows: younger than 1 month, 24.8%; 1-12 months, 32.8%; 1 year, 19.2%; 2-5 years, 16.0%; older than 6 years, 7.2%. Nearly 3/4 of all purulent meningitis cases occurred in infancy. 2. The isolation rate of causative organisms was 71.2%. The 4 major causative organisms were Haemophilus sp. (28 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (14 cases), Streptococcus agalactiae (13 cases), and Escherichia coli (12 cases). Haemophilus sp. was dominant in patients over 3 months of age, and S. pneumoniae was noted in all age groups. The latter 2 were dominant under 3 months of age. 3. The outcome of 125 cases was as follows: cured, 73 cases (58.4%); improved, 26 cases (20.8%); dead, 15 cases (12.0%); unknown, 11 cases (8.8%). As to the outcome by age, the mortality of infants within 1 month old was the highest, 29.0%, and then decreased with increasing age. As to the outcome by causative organisms, Haemophilus sp. and E. coli were associated with good outcome, whereas S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae with poor outcome. 4. Among several antibiotics, ampicillin was the most frequently used in 94 cases, followed by cefotaxime in 50 cases. 5. As to the initial antibiotic treatment, 51 cases were treated with penicillins (PCs) (including PCs + aminoglycosides (AGs], 9 cases with cephalosporins group I, II, IV, (CEPs I, II, IV) (including CEPs I, II, IV + AGs), 25 cases with CEPs V (including CEPs V + AGs) and 31 cases with CEPs V + PCs (including CEPs V + PCs + AGs). No significant differences were observed in the outcome among these initial treatment group. 6. Compared with the initial treatments of CEPs V or CEPs V + PCs groups, other antibiotics were used more frequently in those of PCs + AGs and CEPs I, II, IV groups. In the light of this analysis, the initial treatments of purulent meningitis with PCs + AGs or CEPs I, II, IV were not so effective as those with CEPs V or CEPs V + PCs.
TI  - Comparison of functional activities between IgG1 and IgM class-switched human monoclonal antibodies reactive with group B streptococci or Escherichia coli K1.
AB  - The influence of valence and heavy chain on antibody activity was investigated using transfectoma-derived, class-switched IgG1 and IgM human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive with the bacterial pathogens Escherichia coli K1 and group B Streptococcus species. IgG-IgM pairs were compared in vitro for antigen binding and opsonic activities and in vivo for protective efficacy in neonatal rats. For the anti-E. coli pair, the IgM MAb was 1000-fold more potent in all assay formats. Importantly, the 50% protection dose (PD50) of the IgM MAb was 10-20 ng/rat, while 100 micrograms of the IgG MAb was only minimally protective. For the group B streptococcal MAbs, the IgM was 100- and 4500-fold more potent in binding and opsonization assays, respectively. However, while 20 micrograms of IgM protected neonatal rats, 100 micrograms of IgG MAb was partly protective. These experiments demonstrate the utility of recombinant DNA technology for creating a panel of antibodies that may aid in selecting potential immunotherapeutic candidates.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Early response in neonatal septicemia. The effect of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and tumor necrosis factor on the generation of lactoferrin.
AB  - Using an in vitro model, we report the early effect of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Streptococcus agalactiea (group B streptococci, GBS) and recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) on the release of lactoferrin (LF) and the generation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) due to E. coli, using heparinized whole blood from healthy full-term newborns. We wanted to find a dose response relationship between lactoferrin generation on the one hand and the amount of E. coli, GBS and TNF on the other hand. In a final concentration of 10(7) per ml both bacteria increased the release of LF significantly. The response to E. coli was immediate and mg/l +/- 0.29 mg/l, E. coli 1.83 mg/l +/- 0.76 mg/l, p less than 0.001). GBS was a less potent stimulant than E. coli and the response was only apparent after 20 minutes (mean +/- S.D.: 1.06 mg/l +/- 0.49 mg/l, p less than 0.01). TNF in a concentration of 10000 pg/ml as well as 1000 pg/ml increased the release of LF significantly (after 20 minutes mean +/- S.D.: 1.09 mg/l +/- 0.42 mg/l and 0.97 mg/l +/- 0.36 mg/l, respectively), whereas a concentration of 100 pg/ml had no effect. Whole blood incubated with different preparations of LF for 20 minutes did not increase the generation of LF significantly. No significant changes in IL-1 levels were observed. Lactoferrin had bacteriostatic but no bactericidal effect on GBS and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Immunoglobulin therapy for neonatal sepsis: an overview of animal and clinical studies.
AB  - Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and group B streptococci are common neonatal pathogens. Neonates infected perinatally often develop overwhelming sepsis which may rapidly progress to shock and death in just a few hours. This fulminant course suggests that immunity to these bacteria is deficient. Studies from several laboratories have shown that antibody is important in immunity to group B streptococcus. In vitro studies have demonstrated that efficient phagocytosis and killing of these bacteria by neutrophils or monocytes requires opsonic antibody. Many premature babies have decreased amounts of total serum immunoglobulin G and term babies may not have sufficient levels of group B streptococcal antibodies to be protected. Immune globulin that contains adequate opsonic antibody to group B streptococcus may therefore be of value as adjunctive therapy for treating infections with these bacteria and may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with group B streptococcal infection in high-risk neonates. Although intravenous immune globulin has been used to both prevent and treat infections in neonates, only limited efficacy data are available. Several large, blinded, and controlled studies that are being completed and analyzed will be important to determine the role of immune globulin therapy in neonates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Detection of causative bacteria for bovine mastitis and their susceptibility to  beta-lactam antibacterial agents].
AB  - During the period from November 1988 to May 1989, causative bacteria in a total of 172 clinical mastitis cases observed in 66 farms in 5 districts with 6 areas in Japan were examined and frequencies of their occurrences were determined. Susceptibilities (in MICs) of the isolates to 6 beta-lactam antibacterial agents were also determined. As a result, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was identified in 94 out of 172 cases (54.7%) and were the most prevalent. Corynebacterium spp., Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were found in 52 (30.2%), 49 (28.5%) and 43 (25.0%) cases, respectively. Four species of Streptococcus family (S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis and S. bovis) were identified in a total of 58 cases (33.7%). Susceptibility testing of CNS to cefoperazone (CPZ), cefazolin (CEZ), benzylpenicillin (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) showed that all MIC80's (inhibiting bacterial growth of 80% of all isolates) were within a range from 0.10 to 3.13 micrograms/ml and that there was no marked differences in antibacterial effects among the antibiotics used. The highest antibacterial effect on S. aureus was exhibited by MCIPC, which inhibited the growth of all isolates at 0.39 microgram/ml. The MICs of DMPPC against all isolates of S. aureus were 3.13 micrograms/ml or less and no methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was detected. There was no difference in antibacterial activities against Streptococcus family between penicillin antibiotics (DMPPC, MCIPC, ABPC and PCG) and cephem antibiotics (CPZ and CEZ), both of which showed excellent antibacterial activities. Cephem antibiotics exhibited higher activities against Gram-negative bacteria than penicillin antibiotics. Especially CPZ, the third generation cephem, showed excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., as well as against other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Plus-origin mapping of single-stranded DNA plasmid pE194 and nick site homologies with other plasmids.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194 manifests a natural thermosensitivity for replication and can be established in several species, both gram positive and gram negative, thus making it attractive for use as a delivery vector. Like most characterized plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pE194 generates single-stranded DNA. The direction of pE194 replication is clockwise, as determined by the strandedness of free single-stranded DNA. Significant homology exists between a 50-base-pair sequence in the origin of pE194 and sequences present in plasmids pMV158 (Streptococcus agalactiae), pADB201 (Mycoplasma mycoides), and pSH71 (Lactococcus lactis). We used an initiation-termination reaction, in which pE194 initiates replication at its own origin and is induced to terminate at the related pMV158 sequence, to demonstrate that pE194 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism; the initiation nick site was localized to an 8-base-pair sequence.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Use of a new simplified assay for phospholipase A2 to measure bacterial enzyme levels.
AB  - During investigation of possible phospholipase A2 (PLA2) production by pathogenic bacteria associated with preterm labour, a rapid and simple assay method was developed which involved few steps and which could be applied easily to large numbers of samples. The principle difference from previously described methods lies in separation of the reaction products by partitioning them between organic and aqueous solvents, rather than by using thin layer chromatography. This enabled us to determine that none of the bacteria studied released PLA2 into the culture medium spontaneously, and that only Escherichia coli contained high levels of PLA2.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Sensorineural hearing loss in children recovered from purulent meningitis: a study in Thai children at Ramathibodi Hospital.
AB  - Hearing loss is one of the serious complications of bacterial meningitis. Conventional audiometry and auditory brainstem response (ABR) methods were used to detect this complication in eighteen children who recovered from bacterial meningitis treated at Ramathibodi Hospital from January 1983 to December 1987. Six patients (33%) were found to have persistent bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Among them, the causes of meningitis were: Hemophilus influenzae (3 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (1 patient) and Escherichia coli (1 patient). Various clinical and demographic factors were examined in relation to the hearing loss, but no significant correlation was observed. Since meningitis often affects small children and makes conventional audiometry tests difficult, ABR was found to be a more effective method for testing this group of patients.
TI  - Neonatal susceptibility and immunity to major bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Neonatal bacterial sepsis has continued in this decade to contribute significantly to neonatal mortality and morbidity and is a critical determinant of outcome in infants of very low birth weight despite the availability of antibiotics. The group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens for the newborn infant. Studies on the epidemiology, microbiology, and immunology of group B streptococcal disease are more extensive than those on E. coli disease. Type-specific antibodies, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and complement are integral to immunity against group B Streptococcus, and experimental data are presented to support the importance of these components. The newborn infant is handicapped by temporary deficiencies in host defenses, and approaches for restoring immunocompetence, such as immunization of the mother or passive administration of intravenous immunoglobulins or other immune factors, are presented for consideration. Further studies are required to demonstrate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of these approaches.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in the newborn: a Kuwaiti experience.
AB  - Forty-five neonates with bacterial meningitis admitted to a regional hospital in  Kuwait over a 5-year period are reported. The attack rate was 6.7/10,000 live births. Listeria monocytogenes was the most common bacteria isolated (31 per cent), followed by Streptococcus agalactiae (15 per cent), and Escherichia coli (11 per cent). Gram negative pathogens constituted 38 per cent of the total. Ten patients died (22 per cent) and 10 (28 per cent of the survivors) developed severe neurological sequelae.
TI  - Bacterial counts in cerebrospinal fluid of children with meningitis.
AB  - Eighty-five cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from the same number of pediatric patients with meningitis were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship of this count to the microscopy results, the ages of the patients and the bacterial species isolated. Bacterial counts ranged from 2 x 10 to 4 x 10(9) CFU/ml CSF. Twenty-five percent of the 85 CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli K1 and group B streptococci had counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. Children between 1 and 6 months of age had significantly higher counts (p less than 0.05) than the other age groups. The three patients who had positive CSF cultures 24 h after the start of therapy all had initial bacterial counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. The detection limit for Gram stain/microscopy was 10(5) CFU/ml. No correlation was found between bacterial count and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Endometrial histopathology in patients with culture-proved upper genital tract infection and laparoscopically diagnosed acute salpingitis.
AB  - To define and quantitate histologic changes in the endometrium that best correlate with documented upper genital tract infection (UGTI) and laparoscopically diagnosed acute salpingitis, we studied endometrial biopsy specimens from 69 consecutive patients with clinically suspected acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) who underwent microbiological evaluation for UGTI and laparoscopic examination for acute salpingitis. Both UGTI and acute laparoscopically confirmed salpingitis were present in 37 patients (54%), UGTI without salpingitis in 1 (1%), salpingitis without UGTI in 11 (16%), and neither UGTI nor salpingitis in 20 (29%). Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae UGTI was found in 34 women, Escherichia coli in two patients, Peptococcus magnus in one woman, and with Streptococcus agalactiae in one woman. The following features were correlated both with UGTI and with salpingitis: presence of any neutrophils in the endometrial surface epithelium; neutrophils within gland lumens; dense subepithelial stromal lymphocytic infiltration; any stromal plasma cells; and germinal centers containing transformed lymphocytes. The simultaneous presence of five or more neutrophils per X 400 field in endometrial surface epithelium, together with one or more plasma cell per X 120 field in endometrial stroma, was the best predictor of UGTI plus salpingitis. This combination had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 87% for predicting the diagnosis of both UGTI and laparoscopically confirmable acute salpingitis. Prospective studies are needed to assess the usefulness of these criteria.
TI  - Control of fetal membrane prostaglandin E2 production by bacteria.
AB  - The effect of bacteria on the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGE2 metabolites by fetal membranes has been investigated. Live bacteria stimulated a large increase in the levels of PGE2 metabolites, but only a small increase in the levels of PGE2 on the fetal side of the membranes. No significant changes in the levels of PGE2 or its metabolites were found on the maternal side. Bacteria may therefore stimulate PGE2 production by fetal membranes during short-term incubations, but it seems that the metabolic capacity of the chorion was so high that no change in PGE2 levels was detectable on the maternal side of the fetal membranes. This was confirmed by the finding that less than 1% of 3H-PGE2 added to the fetal side of the membrane reached the maternal side without being metabolized.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in infections of neonates].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated for its absorption and excretion as well as for therapeutic effectiveness in neonates and premature infants. The following results were obtained. 1. Serum concentrations of the drug were examined in 3 premature infants 1 to 11 days old upon intravenous administration of about 10 mg/kg body weight (1st group), in 2 premature infants 18 and 32 days old and 1 neonate 17 days old upon intravenous administration of about 20 mg/kg (2nd group), and in 1 neonate 15 days old with meningitis upon intravenous administration of 45.2 mg/kg. Concentrations of CMX at 30 minutes after administration were 43, 29 and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 46, 37 and 44 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 208 micrograms/ml in the other neonate, and appeared to be dose-dependent. Concentrations of CMX at 6 hours after administration were 18.2, 6.6 and 8.1 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 9.6, 11 and 1.35 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 5.2 micrograms/ml in the other subject. Serum half-lives were, respectively, 4.59, 2.85 and 3.48 hours in the 1st group, 2.52, 2.73 and 1.14 hours in the 2nd group and 1.0 hour in the other subject. Urinary recovery rates during the first 6 hours after administration were 45.8, 87.0, 50.2 and more than 100% in 4 cases examined. Two of these cases, in which recovery rates were 45.8 and 50.2%, were premature infants of low birth weight. Spinal fluid concentrations of the drug at 80 to 90 minutes after dosing to 1 neonate with purulent meningitis (causative organism presumed: Escherichia coli) given 48.3 mg/kg tended to decline gradually with the recovery of the disease, 3.8, 1.72 and 1.32 micrograms/ml on the 2nd, 6th and 8th day, respectively. 2. The drug was given to 9 neonates 0 to 24 days old. The therapeutic effectiveness on bacterial infections was evaluated in 7 cases (10 diseases) including 1 disease of purulent meningitis presumably caused by E. coli, 4 of septicemia caused by E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (1, 2 and 1, respectively), 3 of urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, Serratia and Enterococcus faecalis (1 each), 1 of purulent parotitis caused by S. aureus and 1 of pneumonia (causative organism was unknown). Therapeutic efficacies were assessed as "Excellent" in all of meningitis, septicemia and urinary tract infection cases, and "Good" in 1 each of purulent parotitis and pneumonia cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Bacterial growth in mastitic whey in relation to bacterial association with mastitis.
AB  - The growth of mastitis pathogens (eight strains) and non-pathogenic bacteria (eight strains) was studied using microturbidometry. All bacteria grew well in whey originating from uninflamed quarters. However, the growth of bacteria which are not considered to be mastitis pathogens (Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) became suppressed by whey from mastitic quarters. On the contrary, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was generally better in mastitic samples. Streptococcus agalactiae showed inconsistent results.
TI  - Hospital-acquired neonatal bacterial meningitis: the impacts of cefotaxime usage  on mortality and of amikacin usage on incidence.
AB  - All cases of bacterial meningitis in the neonatal unit at King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban for the period 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1987 were reviewed. In particular, we looked at the impact of cefotaxime on mortality rates and amikacin on the incidence of hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacillary (GNB) meningitis. Klebsiella was found to be the commonest cause of neonatal meningitis, followed by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. Eighty-four per cent of all cases of GNB meningitis presented more than 3 days after birth, with the vast majority being caused by gentamicin-resistant Klebsiella. A decline in the incidence of meningitis from 1.27/1000 live births in 1981 and 0.95/1000 for the period 1981-1986 to 0.22/1000 live births in 1987, with no cases of Klebsiella meningitis being seen in that year, coincided with the exclusive use of amikacin as the parenteral aminoglycoside in place of gentamicin in the unit after August 1986. The initial decline in the incidence of meningitis from 0.93/1000 in 1985 to 0.46/1000 in 1986 was attributed to the introduction in 1985 of strict hand disinfection measures to prevent cross-infection in the unit. The case mortality rate (CMR) fell from 0.65 for the period 1981-1984 to 0.42 for the period 1985-1987, and we believe this was largely a result of the introduction of cefotaxime in 1984 as first-line therapy for GNB meningitis, together with better patient care facilities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a hemolysin gene from Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - This article describes the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolysin gene from a serotype 1 strain of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The hemolysin was a thermolabile protein with an apparent molecular weight of 29,500 (29.5K hemolysin). Unlike expression of the recently described 105K hemolysin of A. pleuropneumoniae (J. Frey and J. Nicolet, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 55:41-46, 1988), expression of this hemolysin was not regulated by Ca2+. Antiserum prepared against the 105K hemolysin did not neutralize the activity of the 29.5K hemolysin; conversely, antiserum prepared against the 29.5K hemolysin did not neutralize the activity of the 105K hemolysin. The hemolytic activity was not neutralized with antisera against hemolytic Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, or purified streptolysin O, but antisera prepared against recombinants containing the 29.5K gene and convalescent pig sera abrogated hemolytic activity. Although hemolytic activity could be detected in several strains of E. coli K-12 and in minicells expressing several different constructs encoding the 29.5K hemolysin, we could not rigorously exclude the possibility that the gene which we have isolated encodes a regulator of hemolytic activity rather than a hemolysin per se.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis--a four year survey in a paediatrics unit.
AB  - The aim of this prospective survey was to study the clinical profile, the incidence among the various age groups, the bacteriology, sequelae and mortality in patients, with bacterial meningitis. Patients included in the study were 36 cases of bacterial meningitis admitted to the Paediatric Unit, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, between the period January 1984 to December 1987. Of the total number of patients, 36% were in the neonatal age group. Positive bacterial cultures were obtained in 45% of cases in both the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. The incidence of neurological sequelae was about 10%. 14% of the patients died and the majority of deaths were patients in the neonatal age group. Among the patients studied, was one who had recurrent episodes of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Changes in milk plasminogen, plasmin and in vitro bacterial growth in whey during early lactation.
AB  - The activity of milk plasmin, plasminogen and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGase) and the trypsin-inhibitor capacity (TIC) were monitored in 40 quarters during the first month of lactation. TIC and NAGase activity decreased rapidly and plasmin activity more slowly during the first week. Conversely milk plasminogen increased as time elapsed from parturition. When the quality of whey was analysed as a growth medium for mastitis pathogens, a slight inhibition in the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae was seen at the day of parturition. There was a distinct stimulatory effect on the growth of Str. agalactiae during the second week of lactation. No relationship was found between in vitro bacterial growth and respective plasmin or plasminogen activity in milk.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - Investigation of apparent false-positive urine latex particle agglutination tests for the detection of group B streptococcus antigen.
AB  - In our nursery, we identified neonates with positive urine latex particle agglutination (LPA) tests for group B streptococcus (GBS) antigen who did not have corroborating cultural evidence of infection. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these apparent false-positive reactions, we examined the urine LPA test in an unselected population of neonates suspected of sepsis. Urine specimens for LPA testing and culture and simultaneous perirectal cultures were obtained from 134 neonates with suspected sepsis. Six infants had positive blood cultures for GBS; four of the six were positive by LPA testing. An additional 20 infants had positive LPA tests but negative blood cultures; of these, 13 had mothers who received antibiotic treatment prior to delivery. Two infants with positive LPA results and negative blood cultures had bacteria isolated from urine cultures obtained in a nonsterile fashion (GBS, Escherichia coli). GBS was not isolated from perirectal swabs of infants with positive LPA tests and negative blood cultures. In conclusion, (i) a high proportion of neonates evaluated for sepsis gave positive LPA tests and negative blood cultures, (ii) local contamination of the perirectal skin or urinary tract with GBS was an unlikely source of false-positive LPA reactions, and (iii) maternal antibiotic pretreatment during labor may represent an important cause of apparent false-positive LPA reactions.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a region of the group B streptococcus chromosome involved in type III capsule expression.
AB  - Type III group B streptococci (GBS) are the most common cause of neonatal sepsis  and meningitis in the United States. The important role of the type III polysaccharide capsule and of the terminal sialic acid moiety of the capsule in the virulence of GBS has been demonstrated by using Tn916 mutagenesis. Several of the transposon insertion sites that resulted in defective type III capsule synthesis were located in a 30-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome. Hybridization analysis of two other type III strains that differed in their relative virulence and of GBS serotypes Ia, Ib, Ic, and II showed that this region of the chromosome was highly conserved. A repetitive 1.4-kb sequence was found only in the 30-kb region of the more virulent type III strain, COH 1. The Escherichia coli maxicell in vivo expression system and an in vitro coupled transcription-translation system successfully identified the proteins expressed from the 30-kb region. Comparison of the proteins expressed from the same DNA fragments in these two assays indicated that some of these proteins may contain leader sequences that would ultimately result in their secretion to the cell surface. Identification and further characterization of the genes and their products will provide the foundation for understanding the genetic and biochemical events in GBS capsular polysaccharide production.
TI  - IS861, a group B streptococcal insertion sequence related to IS150 and IS3 of Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 1,442-base-pair (bp) insertion sequence (IS861) was identified in the type III  group B streptococcal (GBS) strain COH-1. It is flanked by 26-bp imperfect inverted repeats and contains two open reading frames, 1 and 2, encoding 141- and 277-amino-acid proteins, respectively. A 3-bp target sequence, ACA, is duplicated and flanks each inverted repeat. IS861 shares greater than 30% homology with IS3 and IS150 of Escherichia coli, primarily in the region of their putative transposases. Northern (RNA) analysis revealed that RNA is actively transcribed in vivo by IS861 and 17- and 36-kilodalton proteins were synthesized in E. coli maxicell assays. Multiple copies of IS861 were observed throughout the chromosome of COH-1, and one of the copies is located near genes involved in GBS capsule synthesis. IS861 is the first insertion sequence identified in GBS. Its role in GBS and the significance of its relationship to the phylogenetically similar insertion sequences typified by IS150 and IS3 of E. coli are unknown.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Incidence of clinical mastitis on farms with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk.
AB  - A total of 1140 clinical cases of mastitis, with at least one inflamed quarter, were reported on 125 farms with somatic cell counts in bulk milk less than 150,000/ml. The average annual incidence was 17.9 cases per 100 cows and ranged from none to 80 cases per 100 cows. The microorganisms most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli (16.2 per cent), coagulase negative staphylococci (13.0 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus (9.6 per cent) and Streptococcus uberis (8.0 per cent). Only two cases of Streptococcus agalactiae were found. As the incidence of clinical mastitis increased, the proportion of S aureus also increased, while the proportions of E coli, S uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae remained about the same. Most of the clinical cases of mastitis occurred in early lactation, in November, December and January. However, after correction for the number of calvings per month, the incidence of mastitis was highest in the early summer months.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of CPDX (oxime type cephem antibiotic). CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). The 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. Drug sensitivity test was performed for the following strains: (i) Strains retained by our department; 52 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of Bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which CPDX-PR was administered; 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of S. pyogenes, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Drug sensitivities of the strains retained by our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), amoxicillin (AMPC), and methicillin (DMPPC), and those against strains separated from the cases to which CPDX-PR was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for R-3746, CCL, CEX, cefadroxil, ampicillin (ABPC), DMPPC and cloxacillin (MCIPC). Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of glycolytic and cytoskeletal inhibitors on phagocytic and nitroblue tetrazolium reductive activities of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Phagocytic and oxidative metabolic activities of bovine blood neutrophils were determined in the presence of glycolytic (NaF) and cytoskeletal (colchicine, cytochalasin B, and prostaglandin E1) inhibitors. Phagocytosis and post-phagocytic oxidative metabolic activity, measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, were determined using zymosan, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus agalactiae. Sodium fluoride (1.25 microM to 1.25 mM concentrations) did not significantly (P greater than 0.05) inhibit phagocytosis of S aureus and Str agalactiae, whereas phagocytosis of zymosan and E coli was significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited only at 1.25 mM concentration. Colchicine at 1.25 nM to 1.25 microM concentrations significantly inhibited phagocytosis of zymosan and E coli, but not of S aureus and Str agalactiae. Cytochalasin B at 1.25 nM to 1.25 microM concentrations significantly inhibited phagocytosis of zymosan and all 3 bacteria, whereas prostaglandin E1 was noninhibitory at similar concentrations. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, in general, was not significantly affected by NaF and cytoskeletal inhibitors.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a cohemolysin, the CAMP factor of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - The genetic determinant of the cohemolysin which is responsible for the CAMP phenomenon, a cohemolysis, of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was cloned in Escherichia coli. Total DNA from the A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 type strain 4074 was used to construct a gene library in plasmid pUC18 in E. coli JM83. A total of 10,500 clones containing recombinant plasmids have been screened for hemolysis on blood plates. Fifty-five clones which showed a weak hemolytic response after 24 to 48 h of incubation were screened for the CAMP reaction with Staphylococcus aureus. This led to the identification of one clone which showed a positive CAMP reaction. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the recombinant strain expressed a protein with a molecular mass of 27,000 daltons, similar in size to the CAMP protein of the group B streptococci. Rabbit antibodies against the CAMP+ clone neutralized the CAMP reaction mediated by the E. coli strain containing the cloned CAMP gene as well as that of A. pleuropneumoniae. Antibodies raised against the cloned CAMP cohemolysin cross-reacted with Streptococcus agalactiae protein B. We designate the 27,000-dalton molecule CAMP factor protein and name its corresponding gene cfp.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion of IPM and CS sodium were determined in 7 neonates with ages between 7 and 26 days (gestation periods were 37 to 41 weeks and birth weights were 2,410 to 3,890 g) upon 1 hour drip intravenous infusion of IPM/CS at 10 mg/10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Mean plasma concentrations of IPM reached their peaks at the end of infusion with levels of 12.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml for the group given 10 mg/10 mg/kg, and 19.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/20 mg/kg. The concentration of IPM in plasma showed a dose-response to the 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 20 mg/20 mg/kg dosages. Concentrations decreased with half-lives of 1.87 +/- 0.71 hours and 1.97 +/- 0.21 hours for the low and the high dosages, and plasma levels at 8 hours after administration were 0.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration were 37.6 +/- 11.8% and 26.8 +/- 17.2% for the low and the high dosages. While, mean plasma concentrations and mean urinary recovery rates of CS were higher than those of IPM, mean plasma half-lives of CS were similar to IPM. 2. IPM/CS was administered to 11 neonatal patients (with ages between 1 and 26 days) of various bacterial infections, and clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in cases including 7 with acute pneumonia and 1 each with suspected septicemia, intrauterine infection, acute urinary tract infection and periproctal abscess were judged excellent in 10 and good in 1 case, and the efficacy rate was 100%. Causative organisms isolated from these patients included 3 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae Enterococcus faecalis and Haemophilus influenzae. All the organisms were eradicated by IPM/CS, thus the bacteriological eradication rate was 100%. No adverse reactions were observed, but decreased platelet in 1 patient and increased GOT in 2 patients were found as abnormal laboratory test values. These changes, however were transient, and returned to normal after discontinuation of IPM/CS. It was concluded that the clinical results of IPM/CS are indicative of excellent efficacy, safety and usefulness of the drug in the treatment of infections in neonates.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results were as follow: 1. A total of 27 patients consisting of 17 mature and 10 immature infants were treated with IPM/CS. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, and it was administered 2 approximately 3 times daily, in a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 approximately 12 days. The clinical efficacy of IPM/CS in 10 patients with bacterial infections (2 with sepsis, 3 with suspected sepsis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with acute omphalitis) was evaluated as excellent in all patients, with an efficacy rate of 100%. All 5 causative organisms found in 5 patients (Staphylococcus aureus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Escherichia coli in 2 and Flavobacterium meningosepticum in 1) were eradicated. Among 27 patients administered IPM/CS, adverse reactions were observed in 2 patients. These were rash and diarrhea. As for abnormal laboratory test values, elevations of GOT and GPT were observed. 2. MICs of IPM against 14 clinical isolates (S. epidermidis 1, S. aureus 6, Streptococcus agalactiae 4, E. coli 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1 and F. meningosepticum 1) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. IPM showed good antibacterial activity comparable to that of cefotaxime against S. agalactiae; however, the activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus was poor. 3. Serum levels of IPM and CS were investigated in a total of 22 patients consisting of 15 mature and 7 immature infants after 20 mg/20 mg/kg of IPM/CS was administered. IPM and CS produced peak serum levels at the end of the drip infusion. In mature infants, peak serum levels of IPM and CS were 31.8 micrograms/ml (17.1 approximately 59.0 micrograms/ml) and 59.9 micrograms/ml (35.6 approximately 99.0 micrograms/ml), respectively. In low birth weight infants, these were 25.0 micrograms/ml (16.8 approximately 41.8 micrograms/ml) and 55.2 micrograms/ml (33.8 approximately 82.4 micrograms/ml), respectively. Half-lives of IPM and CS were 1.0 approximately 2.7 hrs. and 0.9 approximately 7.4 hrs. in mature infants, and 1.6 approximately 3.0 hrs. and 1.3 approximately 9.7 hrs. in immature infants, respectively. Generally the longer half-lives were observed in the younger neonates. Serum levels of CS remained higher and half-lives of CS were longer than those of IPM. The pharmacokinetics in neonates were different from those in adults or children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Flotation of mastitis pathogens with cream from subclinically infected quarters.  Prospects for developing a cream-rising test for detecting mastitis caused by major mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial isolates, originating from 36 subclinically infected quarter milk samples, were labelled with 75Se and checked for cream-rising at various temperatures in a system analogous to the ABR test ("Abortus Bang Ringprobe"; the cream-rising test based on stained brucella organisms for detection of brucellosis). Diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were analyzed in experiments where labelled bacterial isolates were mixed with a number of quarter milk samples with known bacteriological status as well as samples from healthy control quarters. Creaming at 37 degrees C resulted in specific "recognization" as the bacterial isolates showed preferential flotation in the milk samples from which they had been isolated as well as is milk samples harbouring the same bacterial species. At lower creaming temperatures, the specificity was lost since all the isolates became concentrated in the cream phase irrespective of the milk sample. When comparing the specific recognization by cream of the respective bacteria, bacterial species vary: The prospects for developing diagnostic cream-rising tests for Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli seems promising, but less so for coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis. The mechanism behind the cream-rising of labelled bacteria at 37 degrees C seems to lie in specific fat globule membrane-bound immunity of IgA type. Therefore the milk fat globules from chronically infected quarters function as absorbents for the respective isolates. Flotation of bacteria with cream indicates an in vivo mechanism enabling bacteria to invade the upper parts of milk ducts within the udder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Loading of polystyrene solid phases with microbial agents and their polysaccharide antigens for the screening of monoclonal antibodies].
AB  - Before screening monoclonal antibodies using enzyme immuno assays, it is necessary to prove that the coating of the solid phases occurs efficiently. The adhesion of whole cells of group B streptococci, Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Candida albicans as well as B-Streptococcus group antigen, H. influenzae type b capsular antigen, and C. albicans cell wall antigen to polystyrene solid phases was studied and detected by the following methods: Peroxidase competition procedure, scintillation measurement of 32phosphate-labelled germs, and reactions with monoclonal antibodies.
TI  - [Neonatal sepsis in Finland over one decade].
AB  
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime in the newborn.
AB  - A study of the pharmacokinetic parameters of cefotaxime (CTX) and desacetylcefotaxime (dCTX) in newborns was conducted; the former is commonly used for neonatal infections. The elimination half life of CTX correlated with gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). Elimination of dCTX was longer permitting a synergistic or additive effect with CTX against Gram-negative bacteria. CTX is indicated in the treatment of neonatal sepsis because of the increasing resistance of Escherichia coli to ampicillin and its good efficacy against group B streptococcus.
TI  - Neonatal septicaemia in Finland 1981-85. Predominance of group B streptococcal infections with very early onset.
AB  - A survey of blood culture-confirmed neonatal septicaemia was carried out in seven delivery hospitals in 1981-85, for a second successive five-year period. The total number of cases was 377, to compare with 410 in the previous five-year period. Group B streptococcus (GBS) was throughout the major pathogen (29%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15%) and Escherichia coli (14%), while Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%) has emerged as a significant new causative agent. Septicaemia with very early onset was predominant: 49% of the cases had onset within the first 24 hours; in the majority the symptoms were present from birth. GBS was responsible for 49% of the cases detected in the first 24 hours of life. The overall mortality was 20% as compared to 23% in the previous five-year period, whereas in the very early onset septicaemia mortality was now 18%, down from the preceding 30%. Despite the modest progress, GBS septicaemia with very early onset remains a significant problem, and effective preventive measures are needed.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Computed tomography in bacterial meningitis of childhood.
AB  - The hospital records of 85 children with bacterial meningitis were reviewed and a subset of 25 children who underwent computed tomography of the head were identified. The major stated indications for computed tomography were fever (8 patients), seizures (4 patients), signs of increased intracranial pressure (4 patients), focal neurologic dysfunction (3 patients) and recurrent meningitis (2 patients). Abnormal findings were demonstrated by computed tomography in 20 of 25 patients but in 8 patients consisted solely of nonspecific dilatation of spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid or of basilar enhancement. The yield of information that was useful either diagnostically or therapeutically was low; positive findings of obvious clinical relevance were present in only 2 cases. Computed tomography provides an accurate means of diagnosing intracranial complications of bacterial meningitis. It must be used conservatively, however, to limit expense and radiation exposure and enhance the yield of potentially relevant information. Computed tomography is indicated for children with persistent neurologic dysfunction, persistently positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures or recurrent meningitis, whereas it is of little value for children with prolonged fever alone.
TI  - Group B streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  - Infection with group B streptococci (GBS) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. In the present studies, we have examined the effects of group B streptococci on C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Fresh human serum was activated to form C5a and C5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. The activated serum was then incubated with group B organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Group B organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in C-dependent chemotactic activity. The degree of inhibition was profound with 1 X 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). Experiments indicated that significant chemotactic factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to GBS organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. A number of different strains of GBS of types I, II, and III possessed inhibitory activity. In contrast, group D streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Group A streptococci that were M protein positive also inactivated C-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. The inhibitory activity of the GBS strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. C5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by RIA were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain suggesting that absorption was not involved. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that group B streptococci degrade the C5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 Da. Thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of GBS infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate C-derived inflammatory mediators. The GBS C5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonatal infections].
AB  - Ten patients with infections (8 neonates and 2 infants) were treated with 10.2 mg/10.2 mg/kg-37.7 mg/37.7 mg/kg of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) b.i.d. or t.i.d. by a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion. The plasma concentrations of IPM/CS were determined in 5 of the 10 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient of the 5. 1. The patients studied included 5 with pneumonia and 1 each with urinary tract infection, omphalitis, suspected meningitis, periproctal abscess and suspected septicemia. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 9 patients: the patient with suspected meningitis was excluded from the clinical evaluation because the infection was doubtfully due to bacteria. Responses were excellent in 4 and good in 5 patients. No patient with a poor response was observed. All of the 6 etiological isolates obtained from 5 patients (2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis) were eradicated. 2. As for side effects, rash was observed in 1 patient and petechiae accompanied by decreases in platelets and reticulocytes and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in another. Other abnormal laboratory test values in addition to the above abnormalities consisted of an increase in GPT in 1 patient and increases in GOT and GPT in another. These side effects and abnormalities in laboratory test values were mild and normalized after discontinuation or completion of IPM/CS administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of fibronectin on the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with unopsonized and antibody-opsonized bacteria.
AB  - Fibronectin (Fn) affects the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs)  with certain bacteria. Fn alone enhanced the response, in a chemiluminescence (CL) assay, of PMNLs to Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .05) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .01) but had no effect on type III, group B streptococci (GBS) or Escherichia coli. When GBS or E. coli were first preopsonized in antibody, Fn significantly enhanced the CL response of PMNLs (P less than .05). The intracellular metabolic inhibitor NaN3 but not the extracellular scavengers superoxide dismutase or human serum albumin inhibited Fn-enhanced CL; this fact suggests that enhancement of the respiratory burst by Fn is an intracellular event. We used an acridine orange-crystal violet monolayer assay to examine the effects of Fn on ingestion and intracellular killing of bacteria by PMNLs. Fn alone promoted uptake and killing of S. aureus (P less than .01) and S. epidermidis (P less than .05) by PMNLs but did not enhance monolayer phagocytosis of GBS or E. coli, unless these bacteria were preopsonized in antibody (P less than .01).
TI  - Identification and cloning of a plasmid-encoded erythromycin resistance determinant from Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Plasmid analysis, plasmid curing, cloning, and hybridization experiments were used to study four Lactobacillus reuteri strains showing high resistance to erythromycin. Plasmid curing with acriflavine resulted in a loss of erythromycin resistance in a frequency of 1-10%. For three of the strains this was accompanied by a loss of a 6.9-MDa plasmid, which was shown to be identical for the different strains and designated pLUL631. The erythromycin (erm) gene was located on a 5.5-MDa plasmid in the fourth strain. A restriction map of pLUL631 was constructed and the location of the erm gene on the plasmid was identified by cloning in Escherichia coli. By using a Streptococcus lactis-E. coli shuttle vector, the erm gene was also transformed to S. lactis and expressed. The erm gene from L. reuteri was shown to be related to the erm gene from pIP501 (Streptococcus agalactiae) by DNA-DNA hybridization.
TI  - Phagocytic and postphagocytic activities of bovine neutrophils for pure and mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  - A comparative study of phagocytosis and postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of bovine blood neutrophils incubated with pure and mixed cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae was preformed. Most neutrophils when incubated with mixed cultures showed preferential phagocytosis for one species and a smaller number phagocytized both species of microorganisms. Percent phagocytosis for E. coli in pure culture was similar to that of Strep. agalactiae in pure culture and higher than that for Staph. aureus in pure culture. Neutrophils incubated with mixed cultures of E. coli and Staph. aureus or E. coli and Strep. agalactiae showed greater than expected phagocytosis of each microorganisms alone and reduced phagocytosis of both microorganisms together. Postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of neutrophils, measured by percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, did not differ following phagocytosis of these three microorganisms in pure cultures. In comparison, a synergistic effect on nitroblue tetrazolium reductive activity was seen in mixed cultures as evidenced by higher percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction following phagocytosis of both E. coli and Staph. aureus or E. coli and Strep. agalactiae. These observations indicate that the phagocytic and metabolic activities of neutrophils for bacteria in mixed cultures may not be identical to those in pure cultures.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the CAMP factor of group B streptococci in Escherichia  coli.
AB  - The genetic determinant of the CAMP factor from a strain of group B streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) was cloned in Escherichia coli. Total cell DNA from the GBS strain R268 was used to construct a gene bank with bacteriophage lambda EMBL4 in the E. coli K-12 strain LE392. Recombinant phage plaques were detected by immunoblots by using a specific antiserum raised against purified CAMP factor. Two hybrid phages showing expression of CAMP factor were identified. Subcloning the CAMP gene (cfb) into the high-copy-number vector pUC8 resulted in highly unstable plasmids. Therefore, subcloning was performed with the low-copy-number vector pLG339 resulting in the stable recombinant plasmids pCO61 and pCO62 which lead to expression of CAMP protein first identified by colony immunoblotting. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a similar CAMP protein pattern in lambda EMBL4 recombinant phage lysates (molecular weight, 22,000 to 24,000) as compared to that obtained from a GBS culture supernatant (molecular weight, 22,000 to 26,000) but a different CAMP protein pattern (molecular weight, 20,000 to 23,000) from lysates of E. coli carrying pCO61 or pCO62. To study the excretion of the CAMP protein we performed a semi-quantitative dot blot analysis of proteins recovered from cell fractions and supernatants of the E. coli recombinant clones. In contrast to GBS R268, where the CAMP factor is readily excreted, the CAMP protein is not excreted in E. coli clones containing pCO61 and pCO62 but is found associated with the cell fractions.
TI  - [Studies of ceftizoxime in perinatal period].
AB  - Bacteriological studies and clinical evaluations of ceftizoxime (CZX) in perinatal period were carried out, and results are summarised as follows: Antibacterial activities of CZX in amniotic fluid were determined using the broth dilution method, and bactericidal effect on Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were demonstrated. The bactericidal effect of CZX increased in amniotic fluid and remarkable increases of activities against resistant strains were demonstrated. The penetration of CZX into mother's milk was low, and it was speculated that the drug transfer to the newborn through breast feeding was very little. Clinically, CZX was effective in the treatment of perinatal infections without any side effect. The above results has demonstrated that CZX is a clinically useful antibiotic for the prophylaxis and the treatment of perinatal infections.
TI  - Production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
TI  - Phagocytic and nitroblue tetrazolium reductive properties of bovine neutrophils for mammary pathogens.
AB  - A comparative evaluation of in vitro phagocytic and metabolic activities of freshly isolated bovine blood neutrophils from 26 cows was performed. Degrees of phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by neutrophils were measured using zymosan, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Salmonella sp., and Brucella abortus opsonized with fresh bovine serum. Percent phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by the neutrophils were determined by microscopic evaluation of stained coverslip smears. Individual variation among cows was found in parameters measured, but age was not a contributing factor. Phagocytosis was high (73 to 81%) for E. coli, Salmonella sp., Strep. agalactiae, and zymosan; intermediate (64%) for Staph. aureus; and low (24 to 40%) for M. bovis and B. abortus. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction was distinctly lower than zymosan (74%) for all microorganisms. Similar percentages (32 to 41%) of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were observed for E. coli, Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and M. bovis; intermediate (28%) was obtained for Salmonella sp. and lowest (11%) for B. abortus.
TI  - Vaginal colonization by bacteria and yeast.
AB  - A number of different factors have been found to influence the microflora of the  vagina. Studies showing an increased rate of colonization associated with pregnancy, menses, oral contraceptive use, and estrogen replacement therapy illustrate the influence of hormones, glycogen content, and pH on vaginal colonization. The microorganisms found in the vagina may also be dependent on the existence of specific attachment sites, which may differ in the various areas of the vagina. Vaginal colonization appears to be altered in patients with diabetes mellitus, those receiving steroid therapy, and immunosuppressed individuals. Surgical manipulation of the vagina and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may also contribute to the growth of organisms in the vaginal tract.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of group B streptococcal plasmids and comobilization of Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle plasmids to Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - The antibiotic resistance group B streptococcal plasmids, pIP501 and pVA797, were conjugally transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to Lactobacillus plantarum. The Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle plasmids, pVA838 and pSA3, were mobilized from S. sanguis to L. plantarum by pVA797 via cointegrate formation. pVA838 readily resolved from pVA797 and was present in L. plantarum as deletion derivatives. The pVA797::pSA3 cointegrate failed to resolve in L. plantarum.

TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on the use of ceftriaxone  in the perinatal period].
AB  - Laboratory studies and clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone (CTRX) were carried out with mothers and infants in perinatal period. The presence of synergistic effect between CTRX and amniotic fluid were studied using a broth dilution method. Stronger effects were recognized when both agents were present together compared to each agent alone by the fact that values of MIC and MBC became closer together for Escherichia coli as well as for Streptococcus agalactiae. Against the growth of E. coli, a synergism was observed, but for S. agalactiae, only an additive effect was found. The placental transmission of CTRX upon the administration was rapid, and the blood CTRX level reached its peak shortly after the intravenous administration of the drug. The transport of the drug into the fetus through placenta was excellent and one dose of 1 g of CTRX gave drug concentrations in the umbilical cord serum and amniotic fluid higher than MIC's against main pathogenic organisms. According to these results, it should be possible to treat or prevent perinatal infections by a dose of one gram per day of CTRX, once or twice daily. Cases of perinatal infections were treated with CTRX. An effective treatment without side effects was obtained. No physical abnormalities nor unusual laboratory test results were recognized in neonates delivered from mothers who received CTRX administration. The penetration of CTRX into mothers' milk was low, thus the drug transfer into neonates through the breast-feeding should not be a problem. It appears, from the above study, that CTRX is a clinically useful antibiotic for the prophylaxis and the treatment of perinatal infections.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone in the treatment of neonatal infections].
AB  - Ceftriaxone (CTRX) was administered to the newborn and its clinical effectiveness as well as its blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels were studied. 1. Average blood levels of CTRX 1 hour after single intravenous administration were 39 micrograms/ml in 2 cases receiving about 10 mg/kg, 70 micrograms/ml in 2 other cases receiving 20 mg/kg and 208 micrograms/ml in one receiving 52.6 mg/kg. As is apparent from these cases data, blood levels of CTRX were dose dependent. Blood levels of the drug were between 3.7 to 12.4 micrograms/ml 24 hours later. Half-lives of the drug in blood in the 5 newborns ranged from 7.13 to 10.6 hours. In a 53-day-old patient receiving 43.4 mg/kg of CTRX via intravenous injection, the one-hour blood level of the drug was 140 micrograms/ml and the half-life was 3.68 hours. The blood level of the drug 36 hours after single intravenous administration with 17.3 to 20.0 micrograms/ml to 5 other cases 0 to 5 days of age ranged from 4.6 to 13.7 micrograms/ml. 2. The cerebrospinal fluid level of CTRX 4 hours after intravenous administration with 49.6 mg/kg to cases of Escherichia coli meningitis was 9.7 micrograms/ml on the first day following the start of the treatment. It increased to 23.6, 25.2 and 31.0 micrograms/ml on the third, fourth and fifth days, respectively, and then gradually decreased. Cerebrospinal level was still 5.8 micrograms/ml on the 22nd day during the recovery period. These levels were far more than 1,000 times as much as the MIC for the pathogen at the highest level, and more than 100 times even at the lowest level. 3. CTRX was administered via intravenous injection once or twice a day (11.0-39.5 mg/kg in total) to 13 newborns and 3 infants. The efficacy of CTRX was good to excellent in 10 cases for treatment of 11 diseases (sepsis 1, pneumonia 4, urinary tract infection 4 and fetal infection 2) and all the pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae 1, E. coli 3, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2, Citrobacter diversus 1) disappeared. In 6 cases where CTRX was used prophylactically, infection did not occur at all. The efficacy was excellent in another newborn with E. coli meningitis intravenously receiving 49.6 mg/kg of CTRX twice daily for 25 days. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Mild eosinophilia was observed in 4 cases. Follow-up examinations of 3 of the 4 cases showed that these abnormal levels were returned to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of source and washing of erythrocytes on growth of bacterial pathogens from the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Effects of source and washing of RBC on quantitative growth and hemolytic zone sizes of common bacterial pathogens of the bovine mammary gland were evaluated. Blood samples used to prepare the blood agar media were obtained from 10 adult dairy cows, 10 dairy calves, and 10 sheep. Hemolytic zone sizes produced by Staphylococcus aureus were significantly (P less than 0.01) larger on blood agar prepared with washed RBC than on blood agar prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. With the exception of Corynebacterium bovis, growth of all bacteria was equivalent or significantly higher on medium prepared with washed RBC, compared with that on medium prepared with nonwashed RBC, regardless of RBC source. Significantly higher numbers of C bovis (P less than 0.01) and Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than 0.01) were isolated on medium prepared with washed cow RBC. Significantly higher numbers of Str uberis (P less than 0.01) and S aureus (P less than 0.05) were isolated on medium prepared with washed sheep RBC and washed calf RBC, respectively. Growth of Escherichia coli was not affected by the RBC source. Seemingly, RBC used in the preparation of medium should be washed. The source of RBC, as well as inter-animal variation, also should be considered in the quality control of medium.
TI  - A randomised prospective comparison of cefotaxime versus netilmicin/penicillin for treatment of suspected neonatal sepsis.
AB  - In an open prospective study performed in 2 neonatal units, infants with suspected neonatal sepsis (SNS) of unknown microbial cause were randomly allocated to receive treatment with either cefotaxime (CTX) or netilmicin plus penicillin (N + P). 236 patients were entered into the trial, of whom 222 were evaluable. The number of 'definitely' and 'probably' infected babies was similar in both groups. There was no difference in clinical outcome between patients in the 2 treatment groups and no side effects were recorded for either of the antibiotic regimens. Antibiotic sensitivity testing of bacterial isolates from peripheral sites showed almost universal sensitivity of potential pathogens to both antibiotic regimens at the start of treatment in all infants. Thereafter, organisms resistant to CTX were isolated from patients in both treatment groups, possibly reflecting the antibiotic sensitivity profile of the colonising bacteria in both neonatal units. The results of this study indicate that either CTX or N + P are suitable, in our units, for the 'blind' treatment of early SNS. In units where listerial infections are prevalent, specific cover should be added to CTX. For SNS developing after admission, the choice of antibiotics will depend upon the background antibiotic sensitivity profile of the colonising bacteria.

AB  - Over a 2-year period, 1% of 24,000 urine cultures with possible relevant bacteria from males and non-pregnant females greater than or equal to 15 years of age were found to harbour group B streptococci (GBS) in quantities greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml; a further 0.9% harboured GBS in quantities greater than or equal to 10(4) but less than 10(5) cfu/ml. Patients with GBS in urine were evenly distributed by age. Those with greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu GBS/ml in voided urine more frequently had true bacteriuria (i.e. bacteria in the urine bladder) than did patients with less amounts (p = 0.01) as determined by suprapubic aspiration of 23 patients. One third (3/9) of the aspirated patients with greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu GBS/ml in simultaneously voided urine, had contaminated urine only and no true bacteriuria. The acute symptoms and clinical conditions of 128 patients with greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu GBS/ml urine were studied by matching 128 patients with negative urine cultures (less than 10(2) cfu/ml) and 128 patients with comparable quantity of Escherichia coli. The incidence of acute lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with GBS was greater than that in patients with negative urine cultures (p less than 0.01), and the same as that in patients with E. coli. The incidence of fever was lower in patients with GBS than in those with E. coli (p less than 0.01). The incidence of urinary tract abnormalities was greatest in patients with GBS in urine. No GBS serotype seems to have particular affinity to the urinary tract.
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriologic studies of the frequency of mastitis during and after parturition in heifers lactating for the first time].
AB  - The udders of 100 heifers were examined for clinical changes during parturition.  Of each quarter colostral samples were taken and analyzed bacteriologically. 35 heifers (13.5% of the quarters) showed clinical changes of the quarters and/or of colostral samples. 14 of these animals (4.75% of the quarters) suffered from cellulitis-like mastitis. 13 (5.25% of the quarters) had acute catarrhalic mastitis and eight heifers (3.5% of the quarters) showed acute galactophoritis. In all milk samples of animals with pathological changes of the udder or of colostrum the causing bacteria could be identified. Besides the group of 35 heifers with clinical lesions udder-pathogenic bacteria were found in samples of 24 apparently healthy animals (20.5% of the quarters) during parturition. However, these animals failed to show clinical signs of inflammation at least until the end of this study (10 days post partum). Isolated bacteria included facultative and obligate pathogenic species, 70% of which were gram-positive cocci (i.e. Streptococcus [Sc.] uberis, Sc. dysgalactiae, Sc. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci) versus 30% of gram-negative bacteria (i.e. Escherichia [E.] coli, Klebsiella and other coliform species. In-vitro-susceptibility tests showed best effectiveness of Penicillin against Sc., Cloxacillin against staphylococci and Gentamycin and Polymyxin B against coliform bacteria. Possible pathways, leading to bacterial infection of first lactating heifers during parturition, are discussed. Pathways of infection seem to be of lesser importance for the development of apparent, sometimes severe mastitis with coliform bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - I.v. immune globulin: efficacy and safety.
AB  - Experimental studies suggest that IGIV therapy can be highly effective in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in a number of different patient groups. Several intravenous immune globulins are available in the United States (Table 5). For the most part, these preparations are well tolerated, but adverse reactions have been observed. They may be due to a rapid rate of infusion, the presence of circulating immune complexes, or the production of anti-IgA by IgA-deficient individuals. With respect to HIV transmission, clinical experience strongly suggests that IGIV preparations are safe.
TI  - Effects of alterations of zinc-to-phosphorus ratios and meconium content on group B Streptococcus growth in human amniotic fluid in vitro.
AB  - Several authors have described the bacterial growth-altering properties of amniotic fluid. We examined Group B Streptococcus growth in aseptically obtained amniotic fluid in vitro after altering its zinc, phosphorus, and meconium contents. Zinc and phosphorus levels were calculated in amniotic fluid and in meconium. Separate solutions of zinc and phosphorus were added to yield concentrations of 0.7, 7.0, 70, and 700 mumol. The solutions were incubated with Group B Streptococcus III 893 and Escherichia coli C5 strains, and 24-hour growth curves were plotted. Meconium, 0.5 mg/ml, was added to each amniotic fluid + zinc and amniotic fluid + phosphorus solution, and growth curves were plotted. The rate of proliferation of Group B Streptococcus varied directly with the zinc concentration (700 = 70 greater than 7 greater than 0.7 mumol) and inversely with the phosphorus content (700 less than 70 less than 7 = 0.7 mumol). Meconium enhanced the proliferative effect of zinc and hindered the inhibitory effect of phosphorus. Thus one possible mechanism whereby meconium enhances bacterial growth in amniotic fluid may be by alteration of zinc-to-phosphorus ratios.
TI  - [The study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX; 6315-S), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. The activity of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and MIC was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. This MIC value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. The distribution of MIC's of FMOX against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. Serum concentrations of FMOX after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours after administration, respectively, and T1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. Serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg FMOX were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, T1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. FMOX was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. In these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. Clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. All bacterial species identified including Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with FMOX. 4. Only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated GOT and GPT, and 1 case of elevated GPT were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.
TI  - Effect of bacterial growth on the bursting pressure of fetal membranes in vitro.
AB  - By mounting a layer of chorioamniotic membrane on a specially designed reaction vessel, we studied the effect of Escherichia coli and/or group B streptococcus growing on the decidual surface of the membranes in tissue culture or bacteriologic medium. The organisms grew equally well in either medium. When growing in tissue culture medium, either organism significantly weakened the membranes as compared with controls (membranes incubated in the absence of either organism). Membranes derived from pregnancies delivered vaginally or abdominally responded similarly. When organisms were grown in bacteriologic medium, bursting pressures did not decrease. Addition of bacteriologic medium (20-60%) to tissue culture medium did not affect bacterial growth, but inhibited significantly the lowering of bursting pressures. Bacteriologic medium also inhibited the peroxidase-H2O2-halide system in vitro. Heat-killed bacteria and/or supernatants of culture medium previously inoculated with bacteria were not effective in weakening membranes. The results suggest that live bacteria in conjunction with active membrane metabolism lead to a weakening and eventual rupture of the membranes.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the Ibc protein genes of group B streptococci: binding of human immunoglobulin A to the beta antigen.
AB  - Total-cell DNA isolated from a highly virulent serotype Ic strain of a group B streptococcus was used to construct a gene bank with bacteriophage lambda L47.1 in Escherichia coli K-12. Recombinant phage plaques in the bank were immunoblotted by using anti-alpha- and anti-beta-specific antibodies directed towards the Ibc proteins purified from the streptococcal cell surface, and hybrid phages expressing the alpha protein (lambda alpha +) and the beta protein (lambda beta +) were identified. DNA inserts in these phages were subcloned into E. coli high-copy-number plasmid vectors to produce stable alpha + (pPHC10) and beta + (pPHC8 and pPHC33) recombinant plasmids, and restriction maps of the cloned streptococcal sequences were constructed. Antibodies against the two Streptococcus-derived proteins reacted with high-molecular-weight polypeptides made in E. coli cells carrying the corresponding hybrid plasmids and with several degradation peptides from them. A 190-kilodalton alpha protein, previously undetected, was identified; this species may be the native alpha protein or a precursor of it. In addition, mutagenesis of the cloned sequences was carried out by using the omega fragment to determine the direction of transcription. In E. coli, the beta protein, but not the alpha protein, bound human immunoglobulin A (IgA) in Western blots, and neither protein bound IgG or IgM.
TI  - A two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  - There are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.
TI  - [Drug resistance of bacterial strains isolated from sows with the clinical picture of mastitis-metritis-agalactia].
AB  - The disk method with Ericson and Bauer's solid nutrient media were employed to ascertain the drug resistance of a total of 54 strains of Escherichia coli, 25 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 11 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 7 strains of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 7 strains of Streptococcus uberis, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 1 strain of Streptococcus disgalactiae isolated from utero-cervical exudate and milk samples of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA). It was found that gentamycin only suppressed 100 per cent of the strains. So far as the other chemotherapeutic agents were concerned the organisms showed a varying extent of resistance. After determining the sensitivity of the strains to drugs two groups of pigs (from which the strains referred to were isolated) were subject to treatment. All 20 sows of the first group were treated with oxytocin only, while the 446 animals of the second group were treated with gentamycin in combination with oxytocin. It was found that effective therapy in the case of MMA was impossible with the application of preparations on the base of the hind lobe of the pituitary only. It is necessary to use chemotherapeutic means tow which the isolated organisms are susceptible.
TI  - Microbiology of the genitalia of nulliparous and postpartum Savanna brown goats.
AB  - A study of the bacterial flora of the genitalia of nulliparous Savanna Brown does was carried out both before breeding and at different intervals postpartum to investigate the type of microbial organisms that could be present in the uterus, cervix and the vagina respectively. Of 29 pre-breeding vaginal swabs, Staphylococcus sp. was isolated from 20 goats, Streptococcus sp. from 15 goats and Micrococcus sp. from four goats. Mycoplasma agalactiae was isolated from five goats. The postpartum vagina did not show any appreciable change in the microbial flora, except that Escherichia coli was encountered in two cases. The uterus yielded E. coli from the goats slaughtered 2 days postpartum; Micrococcus sp. from goats slaughtered 12 days postpartum; Staph. aureus from goats slaughtered 16 days postpartum and Staph. aureus from goats slaughtered 24 days postpartum. Also in these two cases-a goat slaughtered at two days postpartum (dpp) and a goat slaughtered 16 dpp-E. coli was present in the uterus. Other isolates from the uteri of slaughtered goats were Micrococcus sp. (12 dpp), Staph. aureus and Micrococcus sp. (16 dpp) and Staph. aureus (24 dpp).
TI  - Proliferation of group B streptococci in human amniotic fluid in vitro.
AB  - The group B Streptococcus is one of the most virulent organisms causing perinatal infection. Human amniotic fluid from the second and third trimesters was pooled and analyzed for electrolytes, protein, albumin, zinc, inorganic phosphorus, ferritin, lysozyme, and immunoglobulins. We inoculated replicates of specimens with known virulent strains of group B streptococci (893, 891, and 878) and Escherichia coli (C5) with Todd-Hewitt broth and normal saline solution used as controls. Group B streptococci strains 893 and 891 proliferated rapidly at rates similar to their rates in Todd-Hewitt Broth. Strain 878 grew at a rate slower than that of strains 893 and 891. The amniotic fluid specimens were similar with respect to factors reported as inhibitory to bacterial proliferation. Second- and third-trimester amniotic fluid supports the growth of group B streptococci as well as a culture medium optimized for bacterial growth. Strain-specific variance in group B streptococci growth rates in amniotic fluid may have clinical significance for those at risk for group B streptococci infection.
TI  - Changing pattern of neonatal meningitis in Sweden. A comparative study 1976 vs. 1983.
AB  - A nationwide retrospective epidemiological survey of neonatal meningitis in Sweden was performed in order to estimate possible changes in incidence, etiology and mortality. The total number of newborns with meningitis was 137 and 40 (29%) were preterm (less than 37 gestational weeks) infants and 27 of these preterm boys (20%). Meningitis from group B streptococci and Escherichia coli, the two major causative organisms in 1976, had decreased markedly in 1983. The identification rate of viral origin was more frequent during 1983 compared to 1976. The total incidence of meningitis was 8.9/10,000 livebirths in 1983 vs. 5.6/10,000 in 1976 but the rate of verified bacterial meningitis had decreased from 3.6/10,000 (1976) to 1.9/10,000 (1983). The total outcome was improved significantly since the combined mortality and handicap rates decreased from 34% in 1976 to 15% in 1983.
TI  - The effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of E. coli, Staph. aureus and B. subtilis, while Ps. aeruginosa, Str. faecalis and Str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. But when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. The levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. Antibacterial activity against E. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. When lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on B. subtilis was restored. The growth of Staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants two to six weeks old.
AB  - We reviewed our experience with bacterial meningitis in older neonates (2 to 6 weeks of age) during a five-year period. Seventeen patients with bacterial meningitis were diagnosed and treated. Bacteria recovered from the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) included pneumococci (29%), E. coli and meningococci (23% each), group B streptococci (12%), Enterobacter and H. influenzae (6% each). There were no cases of Listeria monocytogenes. The mean duration of symptoms before admission was 3.1 days. The mortality rate was high (30%), and 36% of the patients had significant neurologic residua. Our study shows that this specific age group is different from newborns or older infants. Therefore, the initial selection of antibiotics for the treatment of meningitis in this age group should include antibiotics that are effective across this spectrum of potential pathogens.
TI  - Possible induction of disseminated intravascular coagulation in the mouse by group B streptococcal clumping factor.
AB  - A hydrochloric acid extract, the clumping factor fraction, obtained from a clumping factor-positive strain of group B streptococci, was capable of killing mice by administration after injection of heat-killed cells of group B streptococci or Escherichia coli intravenously. In mice killed between 24 and 48 h later, fibrin thrombi were observed in the renal glomeruli, as well as in the heart, lung, liver, and pancreas. These findings suggest the possible induction of disseminated intravascular coagulation by these organisms in the mouse.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies of cefotiam in neonates and premature infants].
AB  - The effect of cefotiam (CTM) on neonates and premature infants was examined in basic and clinical studies. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CTM against 190 clinically isolated strains kept by this department were investigated. This drug was found to have a strong antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, although some strains were resistant. The CTM was given to 0-3, 4-7, and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by intravenous injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and we studied changes in serum CTM levels over time. Mean serum CTM levels were 62.3 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 16.4 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after the injection, with the half-life of 3.6 hours, for the 0-3 day-old premature infants. They were 38.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 10.1 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 2.9 hours, for the 0-3 day-old neonates. Those levels were 22.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 2.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.9 hours, for the 4-7 day-old neonates, and 51.8 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 1.0 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.1 hours, for the greater than or equal to 8 day-old neonates. The CTM was given to 0-3 and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by 1-hour intravenous drip infusion at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and changes in serum CTM levels after the infusion were followed. The 0-3 day-old premature infant (there was only one subject) had a peak serum CTM level of 21.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after the start of the infusion (that is, at the time of its completion), with the level decreased to 8.6 micrograms/ml at 7 hours and the half-life was 5.4 hours. The mean peak serum CTM level in 0-3 day-old neonates were 36.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, which decreased to a mean of 7.0 micrograms/ml at 7 hours; the half-life was 2.3 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis].

TI  - Structure of a conjugative element in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We have cloned and mapped a 69-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome of Streptococcus pneumoniae DP1322, which carries the conjugative omega (cat-tet) insertion from S. pneumoniae BM6001. This element proved to be 65.5 kb in size. Location of the junctions was facilitated by cloning a preferred target region from the wild-type strain Rx1 recipient genome. This target site was preferred by both the BM6001 element and the cat-erm-tet element from Streptococcus agalactiae B109. Within the BM6001 element cat and tet were separated by 30 kb, and cat was flanked by two copies of a sequence that was also present in the recipient strain Rx1 DNA. Another sequence at least 2.4 kb in size was found inside the BM6001 element and at two places in the Rx1 genome. Its role is unknown. The ends of the BM6001 element appear to be the same as those of the B109 element, both as seen after transfer to S. pneumoniae and as mapped by others in pDP5 after transposition in Streptococcus faecalis. We see no homology between the ends of the BM6001 element and find no evidence suggesting that it ever circularizes.

TI  - The role of specific antibody in neonatal bacterial infections: an overview.
AB  - Neonatal infections caused by GBS are commonly associated with a deficiency of IgG antibody to the type-specific polysaccharide of the infecting organism. The prevalence and importance of human antibody to specific surface proteins, which are very common in clinical GBS strains, are unknown. Type-specific antibody is sufficiently prevalent that immunoglobulin preparations for both intramuscular and intravenous use contain animal-protective, opsonic antibody for many GBS strains. The availability of polysaccharide vaccines suggest that even more potent, "hyperimmune" preparations can be prepared from immunized volunteers. The importance of selective antibody deficiency in K1 E. coli infections of newborns is less clear. Protective, opsonic antibody is more difficult to demonstrate in human serum, but activity has been shown in some IGIV preparations. The specificity of the active antibody and the feasibility of producing hyperimmune IGIV against K1 E. coli are unknown at this time.

AB  
TI  - Bacteriostatic activity of bovine milk lactoferrin against mastitic bacteria.
AB  - The bacteriostatic activity of bovine lactoferrin (Lf) against mastitic bacteria  was assessed with an in vitro microassay. The most susceptible species was Escherichia coli; all of the 35 isolates tested were susceptible to bacteriostasis by apo-Lf (0.1 mg ml-1), although a few strains showed a lower degree of inhibition. Heterogeneity among strains was more pronounced among 10 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, four of which were apparently unaffected by apo-Lf (1 mg ml-1). Under the same conditions, Streptococcus agalactiae (six isolates) and Str. uberis (five isolates) resisted the bacteriostatic action of apo-Lf.
TI  - Direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urines positive in the MS-2 urine  screening program.
AB  - A study was performed using the Abbott MS-2 system, in which positive urine screening specimens were set up directly to an antimicrobial susceptibility test. These results were compared with standard techniques. The overall correlation for urines containing single pathogens was 95.4%. Results were available 5-8 hr after receipt by the laboratory.
TI  - Infections of congenital cervical neck masses associated with bacteremia.
AB  - Congenital cervical neck masses are usually benign lesions. However, cystic hygromas and cervical teratomas are associated with a high risk for potentially life-threatening complications, primarily that of respiratory distress secondary to tracheal compression. Children with unoperated teratomas are also at high risk for malignant changes. A third potential complication is that of infection of the lesion. We present two newborns with infections of cervical neck masses associated with bacteremia. One lesion was a teratoma, the other a cystic hygroma. In both infants, surgical excision had been delayed. These cases illustrate the need for prompt, accurate diagnosis and treatment of congenital cervical neck masses.
TI  - Opsonic and protective activity of immunoglobulin, modified immunoglobulin, and serum against neonatal Escherichia coli K1 infection.
AB  - Because modified immune serum globulin (M-ISG) has been proposed for therapy in neonatal bacterial sepsis, we evaluated it in a suckling rat model of Escherichia coli K1 sepsis. We compared a M-ISG preparation (lot 2581), which was protective against group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis, with other M-ISG, standard ISG preparations and with adult and cord serum. All immune serum preparations and sera demonstrated opsonic activity against E. coli K1 and were superior to saline in protecting against death due to E. coli K1 sepsis. Survival rates were higher for one M-ISG preparation (lot 2581) than for randomly selected standard immune serum globulin and cord sera but were similar to adult sera in these protection studies. Therapeutic and opsonic activity of standard immune serum globulin and M-ISG prepared from the same donors were similar, suggesting that the different processes used for their manufacture did not affect these activities. Because the M-ISG preparation studied showed protective activity to both GBS and E. coli K1, we studied it further by adsorbing the preparation with GBS and E. coli K1. Opsonic activity to E. coli K1 was removed by E. coli adsorption but not by adsorption with GBS, indicating that this activity was not due to a single cross-reacting antibody. Empirical therapy with M-ISG prescreened for opsonic activity to both E. coli K1 and GBS may be of clinical value. Trials appear warranted to study the pharmacology and efficacy of M-ISG in septic newborns.
TI  - Does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? A microbiological study.
AB  - In 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. Before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including Chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The Gram-positive aerobic cocci, Staph. epidermidis, Strept. faecalis and Strept. agalactiae as well as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. These microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. Staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. These three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. On the other hand, Strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. Since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.
TI  - Microbial pathogens from goat mastitis and phage-typing of Staphylococcus aureus  isolates.
AB  - Examination of milk from goats yielded 41 strains from 40 clinically affected halves; 15 were Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Staph. epidermis, 1 Streptococcus agalactiae, 2 Strept. dysgalactiae, 5 Strept. uberis, 2 Corynebacterium pyogenes, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Pasteurella spp. and 4 Mycoplasma spp. One half had dual infection of Staph. aureus and Strept. dysgalactiae. Twenty two of the 297 milk samples from apparently normal halves also harboured pathogens comprising of 9 Staph. aureus, 1 Strept. agalactiae, 2 E. coli, 2 Pasteurella spp., 2 Candida albicans and 6 Mycoplasma spp. Most of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to many broad spectrum antibiotics. Twenty of the 24 Staph. aureus isolates were phase typable by a set of 23 human Staphylococcal International Phages suggesting the utility of these phages for the typing of goat strains. The isolates were grouped into 15 phage-types, many of which have been reported from human infections in Iraq. This indicates the possibility of association of human strains of Staph. aureus in caprine mastitis. No definite correlation could be noted between antibiogram and phage types of Staph. aureus strains.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime with clindamycin and gentamicin and cefoxitin in the treatment of postcesarean endomyometritis.
AB  - New third generation cephalosporins have been recommended as single agent antibiotic therapy in the treatment of postoperative infections. This study compares the new third generation cephalosporin ceftizoxime with cefoxitin, clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of postcesarean section endomyometritis. The results indicate that the clindamycin and gentamicin regimen is more efficacious in the treatment of severe infection after cesarean section than either ceftizoxime or cefoxitin regimens. Therefore, the results of this study suggest caution in substituting single drug antibiotic therapy with cefoxitin or the third generation cephalosporins for the standard clindamycin and gentamicin regimen in the treatment of postcesarean section endomyometritis until more clinical data are available.
TI  - In vitro growth inhibition of mastitis causing bacteria by phenolics and metal chelators.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of three phenolic compounds and four metal chelators were tested at 0, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm in vitro against four major mastitis-causing bacteria, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Overall, butylated hydroxyanisole and tert-butylhydroquinone showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. These phenolics were bactericidal at 250 to 500 ppm against all four bacteria tested. The butylated hydroxytoluene was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but was ineffective against the coliforms. At 250 ppm, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but much less effective against the gram-negatives. However, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was more growth inhibitory than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid against the gram-negative bacteria and especially against Escherichia coli. All other compounds were generally much less effective or ineffective against all four microorganisms. Therefore, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid may have practical implications in the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone alone and in combination with penicillin,  ampicillin and piperacillin against neonatal meningitis pathogens.
AB  - The activities of penicillin G, ampicillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone alone and in combination against 130 isolates of Escherichia coli, group B streptococci and Listeria monocytogenes from neonatal meningitis were assessed by using agar dilution, checkerboard and time-kill techniques. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were highly active against E. coli and group B streptococci (MIC90 0.05-0.1 mg/1) but not active against List. monocytogenes. Penicillin G was more active than ampicillin and piperacillin against group B streptococci (MIC90 0.1, 0.12 and 0.24 mg/l respectively) and ampicillin was the most active against List. monocytogenes (MIC90 0.6 mg/l). Every double beta-lactam combination was synergistic for 3-14% of E. coli, 8-26% of group B streptococci and 67-100% of List. monocytogenes in the checkerboard titration. The ceftriaxone combinations were less synergistic than the cefotaxime combinations. In time-kill evaluations using concentrations representative for cerebrospinal fluid, the killing kinetics of E. coli were not influenced by any combination. A significant delay in killing of group B streptococci was observed with penicillin G-cephalosporin and ampicillin-cephalosporin combinations. A significant increased killing of List. monocytogenes was observed with penicillin G-cephalosporin combinations. The other combinations did not alter the killing kinetics of group B streptococci and List. monocytogenes.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Evaluation of Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser for detecting significant bacteriuria.
AB  - In a pilot study a prototype Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser was used to study the growth of six commonly encountered urinary pathogens in a range of five different laboratory media. No single medium had been able to show acceptable conductance changes for all bacteria within five hours. Subsequently, the Malthus system, with fastidious anaerobe broth as the culture medium, was used to screen 500 consecutive clinical specimens of urine for significant bacteriuria. After two and a half hours the Malthus system detected 32 out of the 40 true positives and eight of the 44 contaminated urines. Increasing the detection time to five hours permitted the recognition of 39 true positives and 37 contaminated urines.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Neonates are susceptible to infection since several elements of the immune system are deficient. At present, the most common pathogens are Group B streptococci and Escherichia coli. Prolonged rupture of membranes with amnionitis is a high-risk setting. Clinical signs suggesting neonatal sepsis include respiratory distress, poor feeding, hypothermia, seizures and hypotonia. After the sepsis work-up is completed, the initial choice of antibiotics is based on the prevailing organisms and antibiotic sensitivities within the community.
TI  - Efficacy of BMY-28142 in experimental bacteremia and meningitis caused by Escherichia coli and group B streptococci.
AB  - We evaluated the activity of BMY-28142 against a K1 E. coli strain and a type III group B streptococcal strain in vitro and in vivo and compared the results with those of cefotaxime and penicillin G, respectively. In vitro, the MICs and MBCs of BMY-28142 were close to those of cefotaxime (less than or equal to 2-fold difference) for E. coli and fourfold less than those of penicillin G for group B streptococci. In vivo studies with an experimental bacteremia and meningitis model in newborn rats revealed that the mean penetration of BMY-28142 into the cerebrospinal fluid was 15% that of concomitant levels in serum and that significantly greater bactericidal titers were achieved in blood and cerebrospinal fluid for both test organisms with BMY-28142 than with cefotaxime and penicillin G. However, the overall efficacy of BMY-28142 was similar to that of cefotaxime for the E. coli infection and that of penicillin G for the group B streptococcal infection. This was shown by similar rates of bacterial clearance from blood and cerebrospinal fluid and similar mortality rates. These findings indicate that the activity of BMY-28142 is bactericidal in vitro and in vivo against E. coli and group B streptococci, suggesting that this agent may be a suitable alternative for the therapy of E. coli and group B streptococcal bacteremia and meningitis.
TI  - Plasma fibronectin concentrations in healthy and septic infants.
AB  - The concentration of plasma fibronectin was determined by Laurell's electroimmunoassay in 75 preterm or term newborns within the first 2 days of life, in 97 healthy infants aged from 3 days to 12 months, in 40 septic infants and in 38 healthy adult subjects. The mean fibronectin concentration in citrated plasma of normal adults was 318 +/- 84 ml/l. Healthy eutrophic term newborns 1-2 days old had approximately one-third of the fibronectin concentration of adults. There was no significant difference in the values between healthy term and eutrophic preterm newborns or between eutrophic and hypotrophic newborns. The plasma fibronectin increased strongly over the 1st month of life. No significant difference was observed between fibronectin levels in infant boys and girls. The values in septic newborns and septic older infants were significantly lower when compared with those of age-matched healthy controls. It is speculated that this deficiency, because of linkage to fibrin in disseminated intravascular coagulation or due to increased utilisation as a nonspecific opsonin and sequestration at sites of tissue injury, may contribute to organ failure in septicaemia.
TI  - Opsonic activity of cord blood sera against various species of microorganism.
AB  - The results of the present study on the opsonic activity of cord blood serum against various microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and group B streptococci) show that the activity of cord blood serum in promoting IgG-mediated ingestion is equal to that of sera of healthy adults. This implies that IgG concentrations, as assessed by immunochemical methods, in cord blood and adult sera represent functionally similar IgG activities. Ingestion of microorganisms involving complement-dependent opsonization was found to be of the same level for cord blood and adult sera, when the opsonization occurred via the classical pathway of complement activation. However, due to decreased concentrations of factors B, P, and D in cord blood serum, optimal opsonization of microorganisms requiring the alternative pathway of complement was impaired. Taken together, these results indicate that an opsonic defect of cord blood serum affects mainly microorganisms requiring opsonization via the alternative pathway of complement.
TI  - Adrenal abscess in the neonate.
AB  - Adrenal abscess in the neonate is a rare complication of adrenal hemorrhage. The  radiographic and clinical findings of 12 previously published cases and two new cases of adrenal abscess in the newborn are presented. Sonography was the most helpful examination in distinguishing a suprarenal lesion from an intrarenal lesion and in demonstrating the morphology of the abscess.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy with special reference to group B streptococci.
AB  - The relationship between significant bacteriuria (SB), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. From 30 (70%) of the 43 women with SB studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. The same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with Escherichia coli, the one with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with Staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. Six of 10 patients with group B streptococci (GBS), 1 of 4 patients with Streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. Serotype III was isolated from 8/10 patients with SB caused by GBS. One child born to a woman with GBS SB but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. The poor predictive value of SB with GBS, S. faecalis and S. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), i.e. AB with bacteria in the urinary bladder. SB with GBS even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.
TI  - Rapid in vitro replication of group B streptococcus in term human amniotic fluid.
AB  - 4-hour in vitro growth curves of a type III group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli were examined in sterile term human amniotic fluid specimens. Both bacterial strains proliferated despite ratios of phosphate to elemental zinc in the range reportedly inhibitory for E. coli. After 4 h of incubation, despite comparable inocula, GBS numbers exceeded those of E. coli by 10-fold. The strikingly rapid growth of some GBS strains in amniotic fluid may represent yet another factor responsible for perinatal GBS infection of the human neonate.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - Difference in susceptibility to gram-negative urinary tract infection between C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice.
AB  - The difference in susceptibility to urinary tract infection between C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice was tested for with gram-negative strains differing in lipopolysaccharide composition. Recently, impaired clearance of Escherichia coli from the kidney of C3H/HeJ compared to C3H/HeN mice was shown to be correlated with the LPS low responsiveness. In this study, a difference in clearance from the kidneys of C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice was found only with lipopolysaccharide-containing bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Streptococcus agalactiae, were recovered in essentially equal numbers from the kidneys of mice of both strains. In contrast, of the lipopolysaccharide-containing strains used, all persisted in higher numbers in the kidneys of C3H/HeJ mice than in the kidneys of C3H/HeN mice. Variations in the O side chain did not eliminate this difference. E. coli Hu734 O75+K5+ and the rfb- mutant O75-K5+ remained in similar numbers in C3H/HeJ mice, although O75-K5+ was eliminated more rapidly in C3H/HeN mice. The core structure did not affect the differential persistence in the two mouse strains. The rfb mutants with R1-R4 cores were eliminated after 24 h from the C3H/HeN mice, but remained in significant numbers in the kidneys of C3H/HeJ mice. Even the Re mutant of Salmonella minnesota persisted in low numbers in C3H/HeJ mice. The relative bacterial recovery from either mouse strain was related to the overall virulence of the infecting bacterial strain, but the difference between C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice was associated with responsiveness to parts of lipopolysaccharide common to the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Reversible inhibition of bacterial growth after specific inhibition of spermidine synthase by dicyclohexylamine.
AB  - The effect of dicyclohexylamine on seven freshly isolated bacterial strains of mastitis pathogens was studied. Streptococcus uberis was the most sensitive strain investigated, since 5 mM-dicyclohexylamine totally arrested its growth and 1.25 mM of the drug caused 60% growth inhibition. The Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also sensitive to the drug, but less so than Strep. uberis, since 5 mM drug caused only partial inhibition of growth. Micrococcus sp. and Klebsiella sp. grew in the presence of 10.0 mM-dicyclohexylamine, and, finally the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae was not at all affected by dicyclohexylamine. These different sensitivities towards dicyclohexylamine in vivo were paralleled by different sensitivities of the bacteria's spermidine synthase to the drug in vitro, and also by the ability of the drug to lower spermidine concentration in bacterial cells. Spermidine synthase from sensitive bacteria was inhibited by more than 90% by 50 microM-dicyclohexylamine in vitro, and the concentration of spermidine was decreased in E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa by 70% and in Strep. uberis by 95%, whereas in Strep. agalactiae 5 mM-dicyclohexylamine did not affect the concentration of spermidine at all. Dicyclohexylamine treatment led to the accumulation of putrescine in Strep. uberis. Spermidine synthesis catalysed by the extracts of Micrococcus sp. required 500 microM-dicyclohexylamine for 90% inhibition, and Strep. agalactiae contained a spermidine synthase that was still active at 1000 microM-dicyclohexylamine, The observed inhibition of growth was totally reversed by adding 50 microM-spermidine (final concentration) to the medium. Putrescine reversed the inhibition only when bacteria had a spermidine synthase activity insensitive to dicyclohexylamine. Spermine did not overcome the inhibition of growth caused by dicyclohexylamine, probably because it was not taken up by the bacterial cells used in this study. The inhibition of the growth by dicyclohexylamine (even in the case of Strep. uberis) was reversible in the sense that addition of 50 microM-spermidine 18 h after dicyclohexylamine still restored the growth rate of untreated controls.
TI  - Immediate postmortem cultures in an intensive care nursery.
AB  - The results of several published studies suggest that bacterial infection plays an important role in the mortality of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients. To evaluate more thoroughly this role we have routinely performed postmortem cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid on all infants who die in our NICU. During a 5-year review period 25.9% of infants who died had one or both cultures positive for an organism considered to be pathogenic in the neonate. The organisms most commonly cultured were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Group B Streptococcus. Of those infants who had positive postmortem cultures and who had an autopsy, 95% had histologic evidence of infection. Forty-three percent of our infants with positive postmortem cultures were not suspected of having a serious infection and had not received antibiotics before death. Postmortem cultures appeared to be helpful in identifying NICU patients in whom serious infection may have played a role in mortality. Unsuspected serious infection is a common finding in infants who die in a neonatal intensive care setting.
TI  - The effects of group B streptococcus and other organisms on the pulmonary vasculature.
AB  - In this article, the authors review the effects of group B streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli on the pulmonary vasculature and the possible mechanisms involved in their genesis.
TI  - A study of 280 cases of neonatal meningitis in The Netherlands.
AB  - Within the framework of a more extensive study of the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in The Netherlands (1976-1982), 280 cases of neonatal meningitis were investigated retrospectively. Escherichia coli (132 cases, 47%), Streptococcus agalactiae (68 cases, 24%), Listeria monocytogenes (12 cases, 4%) were the organisms most commonly isolated. The mortality rate for these 280 cases was 27%. The male-female ratio was 1.33:1. The minimum incidence for The Netherlands was calculated to be 23 per 100 000 live births.
TI  - Management of neonatal meningitis, 1984.
AB  - Neonatal bacterial meningitis continues to cause substantial mortality and morbidity despite the advent of new antimicrobial agents and of modern intensive care facilities. In Dallas, the case-fatality rate for bacterial meningitis in newborn and young infants is 17% (40 of 231 patients). Three pathogens, Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes, accounted for 84% of the causative agents. Although new beta-lactam antibiotics have been extensively evaluated in experimental meningitis due to these pathogens, there is limited clinical experience from which to judge efficacy and safety. Currently, conventional therapy with ampicillin and an amino-glycoside should be used as initial empirical therapy for neonatal meningitis. Once the pathogen has been identified and the susceptibilities determined, the most appropriate antibiotic or combination of antibiotics can be selected. Latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefotaxime are highly active agents in vitro against Gram-negative enteric bacilli and may prove useful for therapy of meningitis due to those organisms. Additional experience with these compounds is required before they can be recommended for routine use.
TI  - Tachycardia as a sign of early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - A prospective study in two parts was designed to assess tachycardia in neonates (less than 72 hours of age) and its role as an early indicator of neonatal sepsis. In Part I of the study we determined the incidence of tachycardia among all inborn neonates in 1 year, and in Part II we assessed the presence of tachycardia in inborn and outborn infants evaluated for sepsis. Twenty-one infants were tachycardic among 4530 live births (incidence, 4.64/1000). Ten tachycardic infants were septic. Of 82 infants who were evaluated for sepsis, 13 had proved sepsis, 12 of whom had tachycardia as one of their presenting symptoms. Of the remaining nonseptic infants 6 of 69 had tachycardia. There was a significant difference in the two groups (P less than 0.001). The results demonstrate that tachycardia is an important sign of neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Gram's stains of tracheal secretions predict neonatal bacteremia.
AB  - The presence of bacteria in tracheal secretions stained by the Gram method was evaluated as a method of predicting neonatal bacteremia. The presence of bacteria had a 74% sensitivity and a 47% predictive accuracy in identifying neonates with bacteremia before 12 hours of age. The specificity in predicting newborns without bacteremia was 98%. In the same neonates, an immature neutrophil-total neutrophil ratio of 0.2 or more had a 77% sensitivity in predicting neonates with bacteremia. Neonates with bacteria in their blood and tracheal aspirates, who died shortly after birth, had pneumonia on postmortem examination. In newborns who have respiratory distress and a risk of infection at birth, Gram's stains of tracheal secretions are a practical and useful method of predicting congenital bacteremia.
TI  - [MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime, desacetylcefotaxime and ceftriaxone against four principal bacteria causing meningitis].
AB  - The MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (Des-CTX) and ceftriaxone (CTRX) were determined in relation to 4 of the principal bacterial species which cause meningitis, i.e., S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, H. influenzae and E. coli. These tests were performed using final inocula of 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml. Comparison was made with the MIC and MBC values of benzylpenicillin (PCG) and ampicillin (ABPC). 1. Against 25 strains of S. pneumoniae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.024 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml, respectively; and PCG, less than 0.012 micrograms/ml at both size. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.01 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.024 and 0.012 micrograms/ml, respectively. It is thus apparent that PCG showed the lowest values for both the MIC and MBC, followed by CTX, CTRX and then Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of S. agalactiae, the MIC 90 values with inocula of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values of Des-CTX were 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml, while the other 3 antibiotics showed the same values with both the 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml inocula: 0.10 micrograms/ml for CTX, 0.20 micrograms/ml for CTRX and 0.39 micrograms/ml for PCG. Accordingly, CTX showed the lowest values, followed by CTRX and then PCG being about the same as Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of H. influenzae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, 50 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 1.56 and 1.56 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, greater than 100 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. Accordingly, in terms of the MIC 90, CTX and CTRX showed the same values, but in terms of the MBC 90 CTX was superior. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Assessment in the mouse of cefoperazone as a treatment for mastitis.
AB  - The value of cefoperazone in mastitis therapy was assessed in the mouse model of  mastitis primarily by its effect on bacterial cell numbers in the gland. In addition histological studies showed that the drug was not an irritant in the mammary gland. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that it was slowly absorbed from the gland (six days to absorb 500 micrograms) but was easily removed by milking. In ascending order of efficacy cefoperazone (500 micrograms/gland) was active against four-hour-old intramammary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Strep uberis. The effect against Staph aureus was titrated down to a dose of 50 micrograms/gland. Cefoperazone was not bactericidal against intracellular staphylococci but it did sensitise them to the action of lytic enzyme. Cefoperazone and cloxacillin behaved similarly against progressive staphylococcal mastitis. Both antibiotics significantly reduced the bacterial numbers when four-hour-old infections were treated but the effect on 26-hour-old infections was perceptible only when each antibiotic was assayed against saline treatment in the mouse. The results suggest that further studies in dairy cattle should be undertaken.
TI  - Relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  - Objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. Approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo) infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. Relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. Largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important economically, but average differences were much smaller. Selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.
TI  - Use of the Becton-Dickinson urine culture tube with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system.
AB  - Urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both Becton-Dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. Quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system. The time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. Isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from Becton-Dickinson tubes. By these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and Becton-Dickinson tubes. Escherichia coli (n = 72), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group B streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. Time for detection of positive urine samples was similar in both types of tubes. Delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. Antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by Becton-Dickinson tube transport. The MS-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. The Becton-Dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the MS-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.
TI  - [Neonatal bacterial infections. Kinetic study of C-reactive protein and orosomucoid].
AB  - Changes in serum concentrations versus time of C reactive protein and orosomucoid were investigated in 134 neonates with either materno-foetal infection (group A, n = 111) or nosocomial infection (group B, n = 23). Both proteins were significantly elevated in group A neonates, with mean +/- S.E.M. values of 0.029 +/- 0,003 g/l for C reactive protein (n = 111) and 0.56 +/- 0.003 g/l for orosomucoid (n = 37). In cases with superinfection serum levels of both proteins rose before clinical symptoms developed. Changes in orosomucoid concentrations occurred a few hours after changes in C reactive protein concentrations. Monitoring C reactive protein and orosomucoid levels, in an excellent means of assessing the effectiveness of treatment and of deciding on its withdrawal when both proteins return to normal values.
TI  - Lipid composition of milks from cows with experimentally induced mastitis.
AB  - Changes in milk lipid composition were measured during the course of mastitis infections induced in cows by infusion of either Escherichia coli endotoxin or Streptococcus agalactiae into 2 quarters of the udder; untreated quarters were used as controls. Experiments were divided into 3 distinct phases: a pre infusion period during which several samples were collected before infusion; a post infusion period following infusion and corresponding to the occurrence of elevated cell counts in milk from infused quarters; a recovery period followed after a short pause and represented the return of the cell count in milk from infused quarters to the level in the corresponding controls. Milk total fatty acid composition was unaffected by the infusion. Free fatty acid (FFA) composition did, however, undergo some alteration. There was a significant increase in long-chain saturated acids in milk from infused quarters relative to the corresponding controls during the post infusion period. FFA concentration (mequiv./100 g fat) also increased significantly during this period although the net increase was only slight. Phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher post infusion in milk of infused quarters. The results suggest that changes in concentration and composition of those milk constituents synthesized and secreted by the mammary epithelium occur after secretion in the alveolar lumen and milk ducts.
TI  - Bacterial attachment to the chorioamniotic membranes.
AB  - Intra-amniotic infections are believed to result from bacteria of cervical and vaginal origin which gain access to the amniotic sac. The logical sequence in this process would be bacterial attachment to the maternal surface, followed by migration through the chorioamniotic membranes to the fetal surface. Fresh sterile chorioamniotic membranes were interposed between two arms of specially constructed incubation vessels. Bacteria (Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae) were inoculated into the arm (containing a basal salt medium) contiguous with the maternal surface. The arm contiguous with the fetal surface of the membrane contained pseudoamniotic fluid. At intervals up to 24 hours after inoculation, the membranes were removed, washed, fixed in glutaraldehyde, and examined by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopes. The ability of group B streptococci and E. coli to attach to and invade the chorioamniotic membranes was demonstrated by this technique. It appeared that group B streptococci had a greater capacity to attach and invade than did E. coli, whereas N. gonorrhoeae predictably failed to attach.
TI  - Correlation between opsonic activity for various microorganisms and composition of gammaglobulin preparations for intravenous use.
AB  - In this study 12 commercial immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration were investigated with respect to their opsonic activity for various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci, and in addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments, and IgG aggregates (dimers) was determined. The results show that four preparations that had been treated with enzyme or by reduction and alkylation had hardly any opsonic activity; the other preparations were as effective as inactivated serum. A statistical analysis showed an excellent correlation between the concentration of intact IgG molecules in a preparation and the opsonic activity for the various bacteria; a negative correlation between the concentration of IgG fragments and the opsonic activity was found. The combination of the two techniques used in this study provides a basis for recommendations on the choice of gammaglobulin preparations for clinical use.
TI  - Microflora and somatic cell content of goat milk.
AB  - The results of tests to determine the microflora and somatic cell content of 483  milk samples from 250 dairy goats in the North of Scotland are presented. Milk from uninfected udders had extremely low levels of bacterial contamination, 80 per cent of such samples having less than 100 bacteria/ml. One quarter of all samples were infected, the organisms isolated being coagulase negative staphylococci (83.5 per cent), coagulase positive staphylococci (12.4 per cent) streptococci (3.3 per cent) and Escherichia coli (0.8 per cent). Streptococcus agalactiae was not detected. Somatic cell count levels were higher than those usually found in cows' milk: 33 per cent more than 2,000,000/ml; 22 per cent between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000/ml; 25 per cent between 500,000 and 1,000,000/ml; 22 per cent less than 500,000/ml. The levels of cell counts were similar for uninfected halves and halves infected with coagulase negative staphylococci. Halves infected with coagulase positive staphylococci had much higher cell counts, eg, 73 per cent in excess of 2,000,000/ml. The interpretation of tests based on somatic cell content as indicators of mastitis in goats is discussed.
TI  - Comparative opsonic activity of intravenous gamma globulin preparations for common bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Immune globulin intravenous is a reduced and alkylated preparation of gamma globulin that is stabilized in 10 percent maltose and 0.1 M glycine at pH 6.8. Recently, a modified immune globulin intravenous preparation was developed that is identical to the standard preparation except that it does not contain glycine and the pH has been lowered to 5.25. The effect of these modifications has resulted in a higher IgG monomer content in the preparation. In the present studies the opsonic activity against several common bacterial pathogens was assessed in the standard (pH 6.8) versus the more acidic immune globulin intravenous (pH 5.25). Opsonic activity was detected in each preparation for Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. With all of the organisms except S. marcescens, an intact complement system was required for optimal uptake and killing with each preparation. In general, the opsonic activity of the pH 5.25 immune globulin intravenous was equivalent to the standard pH 6.8 preparation. With several organisms, however, the more acidic preparation had greater activity than the standard one. An immune globulin intravenous preparation with increased antibody titers to P. aeruginosa was also prepared from selected donors and tested for opsonic activity against six of the seven Pseudomonas immunotypes. This preparation was found to have strikingly increased opsonic titers for most of the Pseudomonas immunotypes when compared with the standard immune globulin intravenous. These studies indicate that changes in donor selection or minor modifications in production techniques may markedly affect the biologic activity of intravenous gamma globulin.
TI  - Studies of short-term pulmonary and peripheral vascular responses induced in oophorectomized sheep by the infusion of a group B streptococcal extract.
AB  - Short-term (0-30 min) pulmonary and systemic vascular responses of oophorectomized ewes infused intravenously with a trichloroacetic acid (TCA) extract of a type III (strain 878) group B streptococcus (GBS) were studied. TCA-878 extract induced significant pulmonary hypertension, reduction in femoral artery pressure and reduced femoral artery PO2. These responses were similar to those observed after the infusion of sublethal doses of E. coli endotoxin and could be prevented by priming the animal with ibuprofen or indomethacin. Ewes rechallenged 48 h after their initial dose of TCA-878 extract experienced pulmonary arterial pressure significantly higher than those induced by the first infusion. Similar augmented responses were not seen after rechallenge with endotoxin. Larger doses of TCA-878 extract resulted in increasingly higher pulmonary arterial pressure. We conclude that the venous infusion of TCA extracts of GBS-878 induces significant pulmonary hypertension in sheep and that this response may be mediated by prostaglandins. The vasoactive substance extracted from these streptococci could play a role in promoting the vascular instability experienced by the human neonate with early onset GBS disease.
TI  - [Gonococcal infections in Gabon (Haut-Ogooue)].
AB  - The isolation of N. gonorrhoeae in the region of Franceville was attempted on the one hand with 261 men and 261 women presenting urethral or cervical discharge, and on the other hand with 530 women attending a prenatal clinic of whom 42 had cervical discharge while 488 did not. Amongst the men, 69.7% of the urethritis cases were due to N. gonorrhoeae while this bacteria could be isolated from 15.3% of the women with cervical exudates. N. gonorrhoeae could be also identified in 5.5% of the pregnant women of whom 79% were without exudate. The frequency of N. gonorrhoeae isolates from STD consultations was 440 cases per year per 100,000 while the male: female ratio was 4.6. The isolation rate from pregnant women would indicate however a frequency in women in excess of 1 500 cases per 100,000. The isolation of N. gonorrhoeae was tabulated according to the age of the patients. The 15-20 year group was clearly the most frequently infected. Trichomonas was observed in 2% of the men and 23% of the women with discharges. Yeasts (chiefly Candida albicans) were found in 23.5% of the women but in none of the men.
TI  - Quantitation of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of children with meningitis and its diagnostic significance.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from pediatric patients with meningitis were  examined for their concentration of microbes and the relationship of this count to the bacteremia levels, microscopy results, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration. A total of 2,031 consecutive CSF specimens were analyzed, of which 63 (3.1%) were positive by culture from the same number of patients. We observed that 85% of the total CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis had counts in excess of 10(3) CFU/ml, with 56% of the specimens exceeding 10(5) CFU/ml. A correlation existed between the number of organisms present in the CSF and blood. For example, from a total of 22 patients who had counts of H. influenzae greater than 10(3) CFU/ml in the CSF, 16 or 73% had levels of bacteremia greater than 10(3) CFU/ml. It was also noted that the bacterial concentration had a profound effect on the sensitivity of microscopy. The percentage of positive results increased from 25% with less than or equal to 10(3) CFU/ml to 60% in the range of greater than 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/ml and to 97% at concentrations of greater than 10(5) CFU/ml. Furthermore, a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) was noted between the concentration of bacteria in the CSF and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes observed on microscopy.
TI  - Antibacterial monoclonal antibodies and the dawn of a new era in the control of infection.
AB  - Literature reports concerned with monoclonal antibodies against bacteria, or their toxins, which are pathogens for man and animals were surveyed. These antibodies have important potential uses in human and veterinary pathology and medicine. They are likely to become key elements in a fast progression toward a more complete understanding and control of infectious diseases and of toxin poisoning. A new area of bacteriology relevant to sanitary engineering is also being advanced with the help of antibacterial monoclonal antibodies. This area involves bacteria that produce the biofuel methane, along with other molecules of nutritional value, through a process which brings about the recycling of organic wastes and thereby limits or controls microbial contamination of soil and water.
TI  - [Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration for mastitis pathogens in  cattle].
AB  
TI  - Haem compounds as bacterial growth promoters in whey: a possible application to bovine mastitis.
AB  - The enhancing effect of haem compounds on the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in whey cultures was studied turbidometrically. Catalase, myoglobin and haemoglobin in concentrations 10(-5) to 10(-3) M enhanced bacterial growth. One explanation of this was the availability of iron by these haem compounds for the bacteria. However, evidence from experiments on free radical generating systems by t-BHP and hydrogen peroxide indicated that haem compounds scavenge activated oxygen products and so protect bacteria from oxygen toxicity.
TI  - Comparison of teat dips with differing iodine concentrations in prevention of mastitis infection.
AB  - Six commercial dairy herds were used to test the relative efficacy of three concentrations of iodine as a teat dip over 12 mo. Concentrations were .1, .25, and 1% iodine with free iodine contents of 3.5, 4.0, and 1.0 ppm. Two concentrations were compared in each herd. The greatest number of new infections (71) occurred in approximately 120 cows whose teats were dipped with the 1% iodine dip, and the fewest (52) occurred in a similar number of cow quarters dipped in .1% iodine; however, differences were not significant. Clinical mastitis was highest in the 1% group. If all clinical mastitis were the result of infection, even if bacteria were not isolated from the pretreatment sample or from samples collected at the start of the study and those quarters were added to the totals, then reduction of new infection with the .1% product would be significant.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of the nose and external ear canal in newborn infants.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and external ear canal of 132 newborn infants, aged 3 days and 4 to 7 days, was examined. Cultures taken from the nose showed the following pattern of bacterial colonization: normal flora (39%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (23%); gram-negative enteric rods (16%); and sterile cultures (22%). The most frequent bacterial cultures from nostrils were Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%); Staph. aureus (11%) and Escherichia coli (8%). The cultures from the external ear canal showed normal flora (37%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (5%); gram-negative enteric rods (24%); and sterile cultures (34%). The most frequent bacteria cultured from the ear canal were: Staph. epidermidis (37%); E. coli (8%); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%). Of several factors studied, the type of delivery, Apgar score and the duration of hospitalization were found to have a significant influence on the pattern of bacterial colonization.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - [Choice of nutrient media for the laboratory diagnosis of Streptococcus group B].
AB  - The comparative study of a large assortment of liquid and solid culture media used for the cultivation of streptococci in laboratory practice in the USSR and abroad was carried out with the aim of selecting the optimal media for the laboratory diagnosis of group B. streptococci. Liquid media were tested with the use of 7 streptococcal reference strains, and some of these media, found to yield the best results, were selected for tests on clinical material. The use of liquid accumulation media was shown to permit the isolation of group B. streptococcal strains which could not be detected by the direct inoculation of clinical material into dishes with blood agar. The character of hemolysis induced by group B. streptococci in solid media with 5% of blood added was found to depend on the composition of the medium and the conditions of cultivation.
TI  - Action of EDTA-Tris and antimicrobial agent combinations on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The concentration of EDTA-Tris (3.22 mM EDTA and 0.05 M Tris) used as a lavage to treat otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections in dogs and cats, was found to prevent the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and beta streptococci when present in growth media. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rapidly lysed in this solution. Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris grew in the presence of EDTA-Tris, but to a lesser extent than the controls without these compounds. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 8 antimicrobial agents with and without EDTA-Tris were determined for E. coli and P. vulgaris. A potentiation effect on E. coli (greater than 50% decrease MIC) was observed when EDTA-Tris was combined with penicillin, oxytetracycline or chloramphenicol. A similar effect was observed with P. vulgaris when combinations of EDTA-Tris plus gentamicin, oxytetracycline, polymyxin-B or triple sulfa were used. The results of this study indicate that EDTA-Tris appears to have merit in selected cases of otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections where lavage might be used.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Intramammary infections in primigravid heifers near parturition.
AB  - Mammary secretion from 32 primigravid heifers was obtained aseptically to determine frequency of bacterial isolation and incidence of intramammary infection near parturition. Quarter samples were collected 14 and 7 days prior to expected parturition, at parturition, and 7 and 14 days postparturition. Analysis of culture data indicated that 77.1% of samples were bacteriologically negative, and 15.7% contained coagulase negative staphylococci, 4.4% streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 3.8% coliforms, .8% coagulase positive staphylococci, and .1% Corynebacterium bovis. Frequency of bacterial isolation was highest in samples obtained prior to and at parturition. Thirty-five of 128 quarters were infected at parturition. Twenty-six of the 35 infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, 4 by streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 by coliforms, and 1 by coagulase positive staphylococci. Twenty infections were observed during the early postpartum period. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections decreased markedly. However, the number and type of primary pathogen infections during early lactation were similar to those at parturition.
TI  - Susceptibility of bovine mammary gland to infections during the dry period.
AB  - Quarter foremilk samples (1,574) were collected for bacteriological analysis from 40 cows during late lactation, early involution, prior to parturition, parturition, and during early lactation. Six of 160 quarters were infected with major pathogens during late lactation. Twelve new infections occurred during early involution. Twenty-two quarters were infected at parturition. Of these infections, 12 occurred after early involution, and 10 infections that originated during early involution persisted throughout the dry period. During early lactation, 21 major pathogen infections were observed. Nine occurred after calving, and 12 persisted from parturition. Most major pathogen infections (93.8%) were caused by coliforms and streptococcal species other than Streptococcus agalactiae. Numbers of streptococcal infections were highest at parturition and early lactation. Numbers of quarters infected with coliforms were similar during early involution, parturition, and early lactation. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections increased during the dry period, whereas Corynebacterium bovis infected quarters decreased. Udder infections were few in cows completing first or second dry periods. The incidence of udder infection was highest in cows completing third or later dry periods.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - The significance of group B streptococci in neonatal pneumonia.
AB  - Thirty-eight infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit because of pneumonia (14 patients) and pulmonary maladaption syndrome (PMA) (24 patients) were included in the study. Samples of potentially pathogenic, facultatively anaerobic bacteria were taken from the external ear, blood, throat, nasopharynx, umbilicus and gastric aspirates of the children, and from urethra and cervix of the mothers. Group B streptococci (GBS) and Escherichia coli were the only potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated from the infants. Out of 14 infants with pneumonia 11 (79%) harboured one of these bacteria, in contrast to 3 out of 24 (13%) with PMA (P less than 0.001). GBS was found in 8/14 infants with pneumonia and in 1/24 infants with PMA (P less than 0.001). The respective frequencies for Escherichia coli were 3/14 and 2/24 (not significant). The infant and/or the mother in 10/14 pneumonia cases harboured GBS, in contrast to 4/24 pairs in the PMA group (P less than 0.001). The levels of antibodies against GBS in sera of mothers to infants with pneumonia did not differ from the antibody levels in control sera (parturient GBS-carriers giving birth to healthy infants). The results gave evidence for an important manifestation of neonatal GBS-infection: pneumonia without septicemia. The incidence of the disease is estimated to be 1:25 parturient GBS-carriers. Finally, maternal fever, gestational age above 42 weeks, more severe respiratory difficulties and the occurrence of severe changes in fetal heart rate during the first stage of labour were found to be typical characteristics of pneumonia, as compared to PMA.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefotiam against clinical isolates in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) against clinically isolated organisms in the field of obstetrics and gynecology was discussed as follows: In the point of view of the MICs peak, CTM was 1-fold worse than CEZ against Gram-positive bacteria, while, in the case of the concentration of CTM required to inhibit the growth of 80% or 90% of the total number of tested Gram-positive organism, antibacterial activity of CTM was approximately identical with that of CEZ, CMZ or SBPC. CTM against E. coli, K, pneumoniae, P. Mirabilis was 16-32-fold more effective than CEZ and 4-16-fold than CMZ. Against indole-positive organisms with CEZ was no effective, CTM was considerably effective. But antibacterial activity of CTM against B. fragilis was insufficient. However, in the case that no spore forming anaerobic organism involved in infectious disease, it is said that existence of aerobic organism is important. As E. coli is representative of aerobic organism, CTM with potent antibacterial activity against this organism is seemed to be effective antibiotic for the gynecological infection.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of Haemophilus somnus antibody in agglutination and complement fixation tests and in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - The specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures in the detection of antibodies to Haemophilus somnus was investigated. H. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also Pasteurella haemolytica, Salmonella dublin, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium pyogenes. In complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only H. agni reacted with H. somnus antisera to any significant degree. In ELISA tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two Pasteurella spp. and with H. agni. When whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in ELISAs, only H. agni showed any cross-reactivity. The greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by ELISA with saline extracts as antigens. Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus antigens failed to react with H. somnus antibody in any of the tests. A rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of P. multocida, P. haemolytica, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. dublin, C. pyogenes, and E. coli gave no positive reaction in ELISA tests with saline extract of H. somnus as antigen. It is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of H. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by ELISA of antibody response to H. somnus.
TI  - Platelet aggregation by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Heat-killed group A Streptococcus pyogenes induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Aggregation was dependent upon the ratio of platelets to bacteria, with maximal aggregation occurring at 0.8 platelets per bacterium (final concentration, 300,000 per microliter). Inhibition of the reaction by 3 mM EDTA indicated it was a true aggregation and not merely adhesion and agglutination. Lactic acid dehydrogenase assays indicated lysis of platelets did not occur during a 6-min incubation period. Aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by acetylsalicylic acid (100 microM to 10 mM) and quinacrine (15.6 to 250 microM), with no decrease in aggregation at the lowest concentration of inhibitor tested. S. pyogenes induced the release of [14C]serotonin, which was maximal (50%) at 2.4 min, when aggregation was nearly complete. Gel-filtered platelets were not aggregated unless fibrinogen (final concentration, 1.8 mg/ml) was included in the reaction mixture. Staphylococcus aureus, a group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli were unable to induce aggregation in platelet-rich plasma under the conditions used for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Breakdown of caseins by proteinases in bovine milks with high somatic cell counts arising from mastitis or infusion with bacterial endotoxin.
AB  - Milk obtained from cows which were either infected by clinical mastitis or had been subjected to intramammary infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin possessed high counts of somatic cells and very high levels of proteinase activity which hydrolysed the caseins almost completely in a few hours at 37 degrees C. The rate of hydrolysis of beta-casein was slightly greater than that of alpha S1-casein, but in both cases hydrolysis was enhanced by 6 cycles of freezing and thawing to disrupt somatic cell membranes. A study of the relationship between proteinase activity and cell count suggested that only some of the proteinase activity originated in the somatic cells and also that the identity of the cells making up the total cellular population was important. Maximum proteolysis occurred at 50-60 degrees C, but the temperature-activity curve was a broad peak. Likewise the pH versus activity plot was very broad and was almost flat over the pH range 6-9. Experiments with a number of inhibitors of proteinases failed to give a clear cut pattern of inhibition. All evidence obtained was consistent with the view that several different enzymes with different pH and temperature optima and different specificities contributed to the overall hydrolysis of caseins in these milks. From electrophoretic band patterns one of these enzymes was clearly plasmin, but in high cell count milks other proteinases also became significant.
TI  - Milking frequency as related to udder health and milk production.
AB  - Twenty-four cows each in two trials were paired on age, stage of lactation, and projected milk production to compare the incidence of mastitis with milking two or three times per day over 12 wk. Teats of all cows were dipped daily in a suspension of Streptococcus agalactiae (one of two strains). Average daily milk production for the combined trials was 24.0 kg for the thrice daily group and 22.0 kg for the twice daily group. Quarter foremilk samples were taken every 2 wk for somatic cell counts and bacterial isolations. Somatic cell counts of cows milked twice per day averaged 31 x 10(3) per milliliter compared to 26 x 10(3) for three milkings. There were no significant differences in numbers of new bacterial infections between groups. Cows milked twice per day had 41 new infections and 7 clinical infections and the three-time group had 39 new infections and 2 clinical infections. The many corynebacteria infections were related to the experimental design in which no disinfectant teat dip was used. Three milkings per day did not affect udder health.
TI  - Beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria responsible for neonatal meningitis.
AB  - Neonatal meningitis is caused by group B streptococci (GBS), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes, in order of frequency. Newly developed cephalosporins with a broad spectrum of activity have altered the therapy of meningitis due to gram-negative bacilli. However, we found that clinical isolates of GBS and L. monocytogenes did not demonstrate uniform susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. Antibiotic potencies for GBS tested were: cefotaxime, penicillin, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, cefamandole, cephalothin, and moxalactam. N-formimidoyl thienamycin was most active for L. monocytogenes followed by penicillin, cephalothin and chloramphenicol; broad-spectrum cephalosporins were not active against Listeria organisms that were tested. These agents should not be utilized as solitary therapy of meningitis until the organism has been characterized with antibiotic susceptibilities.
TI  - Bacteriological study of amniotic fluid during labor.
AB  - Amniotic fluid from 207 women in labor was analysed at the time of artificial rupture of membranes or by amniocentesis. The following organisms were identified in concentrations of more than 1 000/ml: Staphylococcus aureus (1), Propionibacterium (1), E. coli (1), group B Streptococci (3), Lactobacilli (16). The 6 patient-carriers of pathogens became infected as did 4 of their babies. Leukocyte counts and LDH levels performed on amniotic fluid did not correlate with the appearance of symptoms of infection. Quantitative bacteriology of amniotic fluid seems to be of value in identifying patients at high risk of developing endometritis and/or neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Detection of gonococcal antigens by an indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - The detection of gonococcal antigens by an indirect sandwich ELISA system is described. The feasibility of using rabbit antiserum raised against whole cells of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain 9 to detect gonococcal lipopolysaccharide, whole cells, and outer membrane (OM) protein was investigated. OM protein was found to be the main antigen detectable with the antiserum in a direct ELISA system. A positive result in the indirect assay could be obtained with a minimum of 46 to 92 ng of gonococcal OM protein or with 6.6 X 10(3) cfu of N. gonorrhoeae. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be approximately eightfold lower with OM complex from a strain of N. meningitidis serogroup B for which the minimum amount of OM protein detected was 375 ng. Negative results were obtained with OM complex from Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides bivius and Escherichia coli. The assay seems to be highly specific for gonococcal antigens. The sensitivity of the assay and its specificity commend it for further evaluation in the detection of gonococcal antigens in clinical specimens.
TI  - [Preparation of immunosorbents from lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides extracted from various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The method of binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from Salmonella typhimurium to aminohexyl-sepharose 4B by activation with benzoquinone was applied to three different LPS extracted from several enterobacteria species: S. seftenberg 1,3,19, S. cholerae suis 6(2),7 and Escherichia coli O141:H32. It was also used for two polysaccharides (PS) extracted from S. seftenberg 1,3,19 and Streptococcus agalactiae type II strain, respectively. Both PS were free from amino groups but exhibited the corresponding antigenic determinants of the cell wall. The use of these immunosorbents enabled us to obtain a monospecific antiserum. They may be a useful tool for serological identification of salmonella and group B streptococci. This method may be applied for other bacterial surface PS. The possible regeneration of such immunosorbents without appreciable loss of their antigen binding capacity makes possible their use for obtaining monospecific antibodies on a preparative scale.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative determination of proteolysis in mastitic milks.
AB  - Proteolytic activity in mastitic skim-milk was often 5-10 fold higher than in normal milk, its level being related to somatic cell count but not precisely correlated with it. In milks with the highest levels of activity plasmin accounted for about one third of the total proteinase. A further third was sedimented with the micellar fraction together with the plasmin, but unlike plasmin, was not inhibited by addition of soyabean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI). The final third remained in the serum phase. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) showed that alpha-sl- and beta-caseins were degraded at about the same overall rate. The plasmin produced the usual readily identified fragments from beta-casein, but incubation of mastitic milk also produced changes in patterns in the gamma-casein region differing from plasmin-induced changes, which were also apparent when the micellar fraction was incubated. As they were inhibited by SBTI, a second trypsin-like enzyme in addition to plasmin may also have been present. Other proteinase(s) not inhibited by SBTI was also associated with casein micelles and produced at least 3 characteristic protein fragments seen on PAGE. The serum phase proteinase(s) was likewise not inhibited by SBTI, and did not produce any well-defined electrophoretic bands, suggesting a rather non-specific breakdown of caseins. After separation of mastitic whole milk, a considerable proportion of the proteolytic activity was found in the cream phase. The proportion was enhanced by freezing and thawing, and the enzyme appeared to be identical to the SBTI-resistant micellar proteinase. Because of the considerable proteolysis likely to occur under the time and temperature conditions involved, our results may provide some explanation for the problems encountered in cheesemaking with mastitic milks (e.g. yield losses, poor curd strength and off-flavour development).
TI  - Mastitis: effect of pH, temperature, and emollients on disinfecting action of N,N-dimethyldodecanamine.
AB  - Growth inhibition of bacteria over time by N,N-dimethyldodecanamine, a tertiary alkyl amine, was studied to evaluate disinfecting action with changes in pH and temperature and with addition of emollients. Because alkyl amines have limited solubility in aqueous solutions, the effect of pH on solubility of the tertiary amine was determined. Non-growing cultures of Streptococcus agalactiae or Escherichia coli were added to sterile buffer or buffer containing the amine, and at specific intervals aliquots were removed, neutralized in a lecithin/Tween 80 quencher, and then plated to determine the number of surviving bacteria per plate. Survival curves were used to determine the effect of changing environmental conditions on antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity was greater at pH 7 than at pH 8 and was least at pH 6. Increases in temperature from 20 to 40 degrees C caused a corresponding increase in antimicrobial activity. Addition of up to 10% glycerin or propylene glycol caused no significant decrease in antimicrobial activity of the tertiary amine.
TI  - Short-time low-temperature pasteurisation of human milk.
AB  - Using the Oxford Human Milk Pasteuriser human milk was exposed to lower temperature and shorter time periods than employed in classical holder pasteurisation. Heating human milk at 62.5 degrees C for 5 min completely destroyed Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci inoculated into the samples. Heating at 56.0 degrees C for 15 min destroyed over 99% of the inoculated organisms. The mean percentage remaining activity of certain antimicrobial proteins after heat treatment at 62.5 degrees C for 30 min, 62.5 degrees C for 5 min and 56 degrees C for 15 min were as follows: IgA 67, and 90%; lactoferrin 27, 59 and 91%; and lysozyme 67, 96 and 106%, respectively. These results suggest that human milk can be effectively pasteurised using less heat treatment than in classical holder pasteurisation. Lower temperature and shorter heat treatment also preserves substantially more of the activity of the antimicrobial proteins present in human milk.
TI  - Rapid methods for identification of common clinical isolates.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - A survey of clinical mastitis in South-East Queensland dairy herds.
AB  - A survey if clinical mastitis in 26 South-East Queensland dairy herds supplying more than 300,000 litres of milk annually, revealed a quarter incidence of 2.6% with a cow incidence of 9% over a 3-month period. Secretion samples from cows yielded Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus Uberis, Coliforms, Pseudomonas spp and other bacteria in 38.5%, 12.5%, 6.6%, 3.4%, 2.6%, 0.6% and 2.0% of cases respectively. Samples from 38% of the cases were culturally negative while at least 38% of the clinical quarters had shown a previous clinical episode of mastitis. There was a significant association (P less than 0.025) between herd and the likelihood of a negative culture result on samples from clinical cases. Twenty-one percent of cases occurred in the first month of lactation and 10.3% in the first week. There was a significant association (P less than 0.005) between the age of cow and the stage of lactation in which clinical cases occurred in that cows in the 2 to 5 year age group were more likely to suffer attacks in the earlier part of lactation. There was a highly significant relationship (P less than 0.005) between cow age group and the proportion of affected quarters and it was calculated that the change with each year of age was a 55% increase over the previous year. Forty-five percent of the isolates of S. aureus were resistant to penicillin.
TI  - Functional bacterial opsonic activity of human amniotic fluid.
AB  - There are some data to suggest that amniotic fluid protects the fetus from invasion by pathogenic bacteria. To examine methods by which amniotic fluid may offer such protection, quantitative antibody, complement activity, and functional opsonic capacity were measured. Immunoglobulins were measured by laser nephelometry and total hemolytic complement was determined by radial diffusion; results suggested activity adequate for bactericidal capacity. The chemiluminescence assay was used to quantitate the functional interaction between polymorphonuclear leukocytes and E. coli, group B streptococci (GBS), or zymosan particles preopsonized with amniotic fluid obtained at different stages of gestation. Results were compared to those for normal serum. Data were analyzed by evaluation of the initial slope, area under the curve, and peak chemiluminescence response. Opsonic activity of amniotic fluid for E. coli and GBS was demonstrated, with E. coli showing greater reactivity (maximum = 15,000 to 25,000 cpm) than GBS (10,000 to 20,000 cpm). Specific, as well as nonspecific, opsonic activity was demonstrated by absorption of amniotic fluid with killed bacteria. Concentration of amniotic fluid did not result in an increase in chemiluminescent activity, which demonstrates that optimal opsonic activity already exists. The classical and alternate pathways of complement were assessed for E. coli and GBS. Preterm amniotic fluid did not differ in response from that of amniotic fluid obtained from term pregnancies. This study demonstrates that amniotic fluid can provide the fetus with protection from bacterial pathogens and delineates mechanisms for such protection.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial and fungal adherence to vaginal exfoliated epithelial cells and human vaginal epithelial tissue culture cells.
AB  - The adherence of four bacterial species and Candida albicans to a new in vitro tissue culture model of human vaginal stratified squamous epithelium was investigated and compared with in vitro adherence to vaginal exfoliated cells. Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococci, Lactobacillus sp., and C. albicans adhered well to both exfoliated and tissue culture cells. Similarly, a piliated fecal isolate of Escherichia coli, but not a nonpiliated vaginal isolate of E. coli, adhered well to both cell types. Adherence of the piliated E. coli was markedly inhibited by preincubation of bacteria with D-mannose. No inhibition of adherence by D-mannose of G. vaginalis, nonpiliated E. coli, and C. albicans was demonstrated. Scanning electron microscopy of tissue cultures showed nonuniform distribution of adherent microorganisms with diminished adherence in areas of active mitosis and proliferation and increased adherence to mature flat cells, often in the process of desquamation.
TI  - [Sensitivity of agents of mastitis to various antibiotics].
AB  - Studied was the sensitivity to antibiotics of a total of 328 strains of mastitis-causative agents, employing the agar-diffusion method. Staphylococcus aureus proved most sensitive to cephacetril (100%), gentamycin (85.3%), and erythromycin (75.2%). Of the pathogenic streptococci Str. agalactiae was most sensitive to cephacetril (100%), chloramphenicol (100%), and tetracycline (92,8%), while Str. uberis and Str. dysgalactiae ranked second - cephacetril (88,2%), tetracycline (77.4%), and gentamycin (74.5%). Coliform bacteria were found to be most sensitive to streptomycin (75-77%), gentamycin (69-74%), and chloramphenicol (66-73%), and completely resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Corynebacteria were sensitive to most of the antibiotics - cephacetril (100%), chloramphenicol (83.8%), erythromycin (78.3%), gentamycin (75.6%), and ampicillin (72.9%). Usually, the mastitis causative agents showed polyresistance at one and the same time mostly to three (36.3%) and four (19%) antibiotics.
TI  - Fever in full-term newborns in the first four days of life.
AB  - Over a period of 18 months, 100 full-term newborns developed an axillary or a rectal temperature greater than or equal to 37.8 C during the first four days of postnatal life. These febrile term newborns represented 1% of all full-term newborns in the normal nursery. Of the febrile newborns, 10% had culture-proven bacterial disease (BD). Fever developed in 54%, 27%, 13%, and 6% on the first, second, third, and fourth days, respectively. In 17 newborns fever developed within the first hour of life; 13 of these had mothers with fever and two others were under a radiant warmer in the birth room. Fever occurring on the third day of postnatal life had a significantly higher chance of being associated with BD than fever occurring at any other time in the first four days of postnatal life. Newborns with temperature greater than or equal to 39 C had a significantly higher incidence of BD than newborns with temperature less than 39 C. The incidence of fever among breast-fed newborns (0.98%) was similar to that of formula-fed newborns (1.01%). Of the 100 febrile newborns, 45 had other symptoms compatible with BD, and eight of these had proven BD (group B Streptococcus in five, group D Streptococcus in one, Shigella D in one, and Propionibacterium species in one). The two other febrile newborns with proven BD had no other symptoms of infection (group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli). Mean WBC count of febrile newborns with BD was significantly lower than that of febrile newborns without BD. Only three febrile newborns had WBC count less than 5,000/cu mm and two of them had proven BD. Febrile newborns should be evaluated and treated with antibiotics when they have symptoms of infection other than fever or when the fever persists or recurs.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of amniotic fluid from women with clinical intraamniotic infection at term.
AB  - Amniotic fluid was collected through an intrauterine catheter from 52 women with  clinical intraamniotic infection and from 52 uninfected matched control women. The amniotic fluid was cultured quantitatively for anaerobes and aerobes. Patients with intraamniotic infection were matched with the control women on the basis of gestational age, interval from membrane rupture to specimen collection, and interval from membrane rupture to delivery. The patients with intraamniotic infection had a significantly higher mean temperature (38.4 vs. 37.1 C) and a higher mean leukocyte count (15,740 vs. 11,740 cells/mm3). In 80.6% of specimens from the women with intraamniotic infection and 30.8% of those from the control subjects, greater than or equal to 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were isolated from the amniotic fluid (P less than 0.001). Also, in 69.2% of the former and 7.7% of the latter, there were greater than or equal to 10(2) cfu of isolates considered to be "high-virulence" isolates/ml (P less than 0.001).
TI  - Effects of washing on the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis.
AB  - Six stallions were subjected to extensive cleansing of the penis and prepuce with water, Ivory Soap and water, or Betadine surgical scrub and water. The stallions were all washed for 14 days, and then allowed 14 days respite. This pattern of washing and resting was repeated consecutively. Swabs were taken from all 7 stallions twice weekly and semen was collected once a week for bacteriological examination. All forms of cleansing altered the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis; the Ivory Soap tended to encourage the replacement of the normal flora with coliform organisms, while Betadine favoured the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. This experiment showed that the systematic washing of a stallion's penis will cause the normal flora to be replaced with pathogens and potential pathogens.
TI  - Agglutination of bacteria by a sialic acid-specific lectin of the snail Cepaea hortensis.
AB  - Aqueous extracts from lyophilized albumen glands of the garden snail (Cepaea hortensis) exhibit, after separation from a second lectin, a specificity against sialic acid-containing polymers. In agglutination studies with bacteria, the lectin interacts with all strains of group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae) containing type-specific polysaccharides. In contrast, group B streptococci containing only protein type antigens as well as all strains of other Lancefield streptococcal groups and several other bacterial strains did not react.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriological analysis of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Quantitative bacteriological analysis of amniotic fluid (AF) was performed on 60  fluid samples collected by catheter from 50 selected labor patients regarded as liable to infection. AF cultures were positive in 52 cases. The bacterial colony counts ranged from less than 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter to 10(9) CFU/ml. Pathogenic bacteria in neonates such as group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes were encountered with numerations equal to or greater than 10(7) CFU/ml in groups with clinical findings. An excellent correlation was noted between bacterial counts in AF and clinical data (p less than 0.00006). The results confirm that the quantitative bacteria analysis of the AF is a useful tool for evaluation of an infection risk for neonates.
TI  - Pivmecillinam in complicated urinary infections failing to respond to conventional therapy.
AB  - Forty-three patients with a history of recurrent urinary infections, many of whom had renal involvement and had recently failed treatment, were then treated with pivmecillinam (400 mg 8-hourly for seven days). One week after the end of treatment the bacteriological cure rate was 72.1%. During the following four weeks, however, several of the cured patients relapsed, so that the cure rate five weeks after the end of treatment was only 46%. Thus, it is recommended that such patients should begin prophylactic treatment if found to be abacteriuric after the one week follow-up. Pivmecillinam was extremely well tolerated.
TI  - A prospective study of group B streptococcal bacteriuria in pregnancy.
AB  - Bacteriuria in pregnancy was prospectively studied in 569 women, with specific reference to group B streptococcal infection. Forty-six patients (8%) had bacteriuria, including 14 with group B streptococcal infection; group B streptococci (GBS) were exceeded in frequency only by Escherichia coli. Two thirds of the bacteriuric patients remained asymptomatic. The outcome of pregnancy was studied in 41/46 bacteriuric patients, including all those with group B streptococcal infection. Two pregnancies ended in intrauterine fetal death, and one neonate developed group B streptococcal sepsis; all three complications occurred in the 14 women with group B streptococcal bacteriuria. Diabetes mellitus appeared to increase the risk of group B streptococcal bacteriuria. This study revealed that group B streptococcal bacteriuria is more common in pregnancy than was previously suspected and suggests that culture methods to detect GBS should be used in bacteriuria screening programs done in pregnancy. In terms of perinatal infection risk, screening for group B streptococcal bacteriuria at or near the time of delivery may be more meaningful than other group B streptococcal surveillance culture studies.
TI  - [Causes of the antibacterial action of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Strept. faecalis, Stap. epidermidis and Staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. In comparison to Standard I broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with Staph. epidermidis. We further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with Staph. epidermidis. We showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. It could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding Standard I both to amniotic fluid samples. In the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to vaginal epithelial cells at various times in the menstrual cycle.
AB  - Adherence of vaginal isolates of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus species, group B streptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells was studied in 10 healthy, sexually active medical students. Studies were done pre- and postmenstrually and at midcycle for two consecutive menstrual cycles. The mean number of adherent bacteria per vaginal epithelial cell (range) was 3.4 (0 to 14) for E. coli, 60.5 (12 to 152) for Lactobacillus species, 54.8 (21 to 76) for group B streptococci, 67.4 (15 to 161) for G. vaginalis, and 58.9 (15 to 186) diplococci for N. gonorrhoeae. Adherence of G. vaginalis increased with increasing acidity of the test medium (pH 4 to 8). There were no significant differences in adherence to vaginal epithelial cells obtained at the various times in the menstrual cycle for any of the organisms (p greater than 0.05). The pattern and extent of adherence among the women was similar for each organism. In this in vitro model, adherence characteristics did not vary with the menstrual cycle.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and bacteriologic efficacy of moxalactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and rocephin in experimental bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and bacteriologic efficacy of four beta-lactam antibiotics were studied in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rabbits using two test strains, Escherichia coli type K1 and group B Streptococcus type III, and 24 gram-positive isolates. Although moxalactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and rocephin are active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, the gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus faecalis were resistant to all four drugs; group B streptococci were resistant to moxalactam. In rabbit CSF, moxalactam had the greatest concentration and penetration, but rocephin had the longest half-life and duration of bactericidal activity. These two drugs were most effective in the CSF of E. coli K1-infected rabbits. Except for moxalatam, the four drugs were comparable to ampicillin in reducing counts of group B Streptococcus type III in CSF. Drug accumulation in CSF and appreciable bacterial killing were observed in E. coli K1-infected animals give moxalactam either periodically or by constant infusion.
TI  - Amniotic fluid activity against Bacteroides fragilis and group B streptococci.
AB  - The antimicrobial capacity of amniotic fluid (AF) against B. fragilis, group B streptococci and Escherichia coli, the latter as a reference indicator, was investigated in samples from 30 patients. In order to study trimester as well as individual variations in the antibacterial activity, 10 individual samples from each trimester of pregnancy (AF1, AF2, AF3), were separately tested. With B. fragilis all trimester samples showed initial inhibition lasting for 8 h, the bacteria then regaining growth capacity in all AF1, and the majority of AF2 and AF3 specimens. However, 4 AF2 and 3 AF3 samples showed continued bacteriostatic activity for up to 24 h. Group B streptococci exhibited uninhibited growth in all trimester samples. The growth of E. coli in AF1 and AF2 was not inhibited, whereas in AF3 a temporary arrest was observed at 8 h, this being followed by growth to control levels at 24 h. The findings may explain the frequent isolation of B. fragilis from cases of septic abortions during the first trimester. Individual variation in the effectiveness of the antibacterial activity against B. fragilis in AF2 and AF3 may explain why this microorganism, which is often implicated in severe maternal and neonatal infections, is occasionally recovered from the mother's endocervix without signs of disease. The inefficacy of AF in defence against group B streptococci correlates well with the frequent isolation of these bacteria from cases of severe congenital infections associated with premature delivery.
TI  - [The bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of 100 samples of amniotic fluid (LA)  was studied against 5 bacterial species that are responsible for neonatal infections. These results show that there is a bacteriostatic activity in liquor. 52 specimens of liquor amnii (52%) were shown to be active against at least one of the 5 bacterial specimens studied. 32 samples of liquor (32%) were active against Listeria monocytogenes, 21 (21%) against Flavobacterium meningosepticum, 18 (18%) against Escherichia coli, 17 (17%) against group B streptococci and 7 (7%) against Bacteroides fragilis. A simultaneous study of the 6 types of germs show a separate characteristics of this activity. In this way the number of samples of liquor that were active against one or at the same time against 2, 3, 4 or 5 bacteria were respectively 24, 19, 5, 2 and 2. The bacteriostatic effect was more frequently active in those samples of liquor which were studied near term (57.5%) than in the samples studied nearer the beginning of pregnancy (31.5%). All the same, this difference is not statistically significant. There was no difference in the antibacterial activity of samples of liquor from normal and from abnormal pregnancies. The bacterial effect was found only in 12% of samples of liquor, particularly against streptococcus B (8%) and against Listeria monocytogenes (4%). This bactericidal effect was only found after the 31st week of amenorrhoea.
TI  - Effect of CSF on bacterial growth.
AB  - The growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (S epidermidis) were compared using CSF, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and a phosphate buffer. Each grew less in CSF than in TSB. Escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between CSF and TSB at 24 hours of growth, whereas S epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. The differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for E. coli. Similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. The non-support of bacterial growth by CSF may constitute a host defense mechanism. The basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the CSF.

TI  - Sensitivities to antibiotics and seasonal occurrence of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - In a 2-yr survey of the Clemson University's dairy herd, each sample of mastitic  milk was cultured, and mastitis pathogens were isolated. Causative organisms then were subjected to disc assay of sensitivity to antibiotics. Antibiotics were penicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, cephalothin (cephalosporin), ampicillin and novobiocin. The more widely used antibiotics--penicillin, streptomycin, and erythromycin--were relatively ineffective for bacterial sensitivity in vitro, whereas bacterial sensitivity in vitro for oxytetracycline and cephalothin was considerably more. These results also were true in vivo in treatment of animals in the University herd. Incidence of mastitis under our conditions of weather, housing, and management increased greatly during summer months with less increase during winter months.
TI  - Studies on the growth-inhibiting property of amniotic fluids from two United States population groups.
AB  - This study attempted to determine if lack of antimicrobial activity in amniotic fluid is the reason United States blacks have more amniotic fluid bacterial infection than whites. No significant interracial differences were found in a study of 111 fluids from whites and 56 fluids from blacks. It has been claimed that the phosphate:zinc ratio in amniotic fluid is an accurate predictor of antimicrobial activity. The present study found this often to be untrue. Amniotic fluids that lacked antimicrobial activity gained such activity when zinc was added, but the in vitro zinc levels required were usually higher than observed physiologic concentrations. Previous studies have claimed that antimicrobial activity first appears in the amniotic fluid in the third trimester of gestation. We found such activity in the majority of fluids by the end of the first trimester, with a Staphylococcus aureus indicator; in contrast, with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae as test organisms, greater inhibition was observed after 35 weeks.
TI  - A survey of mastitis in the British dairy herd.
AB  - Five hundred herds were examined to determine the prevalence of subclinical mastitis in the British dairy herd. The prevalences of the various infections recorded were Streptococcus agalactiae 3.4 per cent of quarters, S dysgalactiae 1.1 per cent, S uberis 1.5 per cent and Staphylococcus pyogenes 8.1 per cent. There were regional differences in the prevalence of some of these pathogens. The national prevalence of subclinical mastitis as defined by the International Dairy Federation was 9.6 per cent of all quarters. Udder infections were less prevalent in herds where mastitis control measures were being used. The prevalence of infection also declined as the size of herd increased. However, as the uptake of mastitis control measures was greater in the larger herds it seems likely that the widespread use of control measures was the most important factor responsible for the relatively low prevalence of subclinical mastitis.

TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Mastitis: II. Evaluation of antimicrobial amines for use as teat dips.
AB  - Recent proposals by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate teat dips as drugs have led to a search for safer teat dip ingredients. Primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines (carbon-10 to -18 chain length) inhibit growth of mastitic bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichi coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in a broth tube culture assay. Since carbon-13 compounds were active, a carbon-13 primary (tridecanamine hydrochloride), secondary methyl (N-methyltridecanamine), secondary ethyl (N-ethyltridecanamine), tertiary dimethyl amine (N, N-dimethyltridecanamine), and carbon-12 quaternary amine (N, N, -trimethyldodecaneammonium chloride) were tested for their ability to reduce experimentally applied populations of S. agalactiae or E. coli on the bovine teat surface. The five compounds were compared at concentrations of 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,000, and 10,000 ppm. Activity was greater against the gram-positive S. agalactiae than against the gram-negative E. coli. The tertiary amine was most active, producing a log reduction of 4 (reduction of bacterial number from 10(6) to 10(2)) at a concentration of 3,000 ppm in the teat dip. The relative order of effectiveness for the amines was: dimethyl tertiary greater than methyl secondary greater than ethyl secondary greater than primary = quaternary. The results suggest that these amines may be useful as potent, effective antibacterial agents for incorporation into teat dips.
TI  - Adherence in vitro of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Escherichia coli and group B streptococci to vaginal epithelial cells of post-menopausal women.
AB  - The adherence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli and group B streptococci to vaginal epithelial cells from post-menopausal women was studied by an in vitro test system. It was found that the adherence rate of gonococci to vaginal cells from women on oestrogen treatment was statistically significantly higher (p less than 0.001) as compared to those without such a treatment. No increased adherence was found for E. coli and group B streptococci. The cellular and functional bases of these findings are discussed.
TI  - In vitro studies of the adherence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and other urogenital bacteria to vaginal and uroepithelial cells, with special regard to the menstrual cycle.
AB  - The adherence to vaginal epithelial and uroepithelial cells of three serogroups (W/I, W/II and W/III) and their colony colour opacity variants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were studied with regard to the menstrual cycle, using an in vitro test method. Vaginal epithelial cells obtained in the post-menstrual phase attach more gonococci than cells obtained in the pre-menstrual phase. This difference was statistically highly significant (p less than 0.001) for the three serogroups tested. The adherence rate also differed with regard to the three serogroups used in the tests (W/II greater than W/III greater than W/I), and with regard to organisms from opaque greater than transparent). There was no variation in the adherence of gonococci to uroepithelial cells during the menstrual cycle. E coli, S. saprophyticus and group B streptococci showed a tendency to increased adherence to vaginal epithelial cells in the post-menstrual phase compared with ther pre-menstrual one, but the difference was not statistically significant.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of expressed breast milk.
AB  - In a study of breast milk collected into sterile bottles rinsed in 1% hypochlorite solution the hypochlorite solution adherent to the sides of the bottles apparently caused a large reduction in bacterial contamination of the milk after storage at 4 degrees C for up to four hours. Heating expressed breast milk at 62.5 degrees C for five minutes destroyed over 90% of the Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci inoculated into the milk samples. Rinsing collecting bottles with hypochlorite solution may be valuable in collecting milk with a low bacterial content for human-milk banks. Furthermore, the currently accepted pasteurisation time of 30 minutes may be excessive.

TI  - Defective activation of the third component of complement in the sera of newborn  infants.
AB  - The activation of the terminal complement components, C3--9, plays an important role in the host's defense against infection. In the present study, the ability of bacteria to activate the third component of complement (C3) in newborn serum was examined. A variety of bacteria were incubated in test sera at 37 degrees C for 30 min and the percent of available C3 that was activated was measured. Using one strain of Escherchia coli (no. 3), 32% (mean) of the available C3 was activated in sera from 18 newborns, as compared to 85% in sera from their mothers and 79% in sera from 13 normal adults (P less than 0.005). In contrast, using another strain of E. coli (N70), the percent of C3 activated in newborn sera (83%) was the same as in sera from their mothers (81%) or in sera from normal adults (73%). The defective activation of C3 in newborn sera by E. coli was not related to the presence of the K1 antigen. Newborn sera were also challenged with other bacterial species and the activation of C3 was deficient when tested with klebsiellae, but not with staphylococci or streptococci. The defect in newborn sera appeared to be due to a deficiency of a serum factor rather than to the presence of an inhibitor.
TI  - Neonatal lung abscess. A report of six cases.
AB  - Six infants 8 weeks of age or younger had lung abscesses treated in our medical center during the 20-year period of from 1957 to 1977. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, the etiologic organisms, and the therapeutic approach differ from those in older children and adults. The pathogenic organisms were Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, initial therapy with a penicillin and an aminoglycoside are indicated until identification and susceptibility results are available on the organism isolated from the abscess cavity. Previously undiagnosed cystic malformations of the lung were seen in two of the six patients. Surgical intervention is usually required in this age group.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.
TI  - The effect of an intramammary infusion of endotoxin on the establishment of experimental mastitis by Streptococcus agalactiae in the cow.
AB  - An infusion of E. coli endotoxin (10 microgram) into the mammary gland of the cow 16 h before experimental infection with St. agalactiae prevented the establishment of mastitis. A clinical examination of the affected gland did not reveal signs of inflammation, all organisms were eliminated from the milk by 36 h after infection. Mammary glands not pretreated with endotoxin, and injected with the same number of viable streptococci, showed signs of severe inflammation the milk yield was reduced and the injected pathogen could be isolated from the gland for up to 14 days when sampling was discontinued. The injection of endotoxin alone produced a rapid increase in the cell count of the milk, there were some signs of inflammation and 80% of the cells in the milk were neutrophils. The cell counts in the milk remained above normal for 7-10 days. Untreated control quarters appeared to be unaffected by the injection of E. coli endotoxin into an adjacent quarter, on the other hand the injection of St. agalactiae into the adjacent quarter on the same side of the udder produced a cell response which reached a peak after 2 days and returned to preinoculation levels by the fourth day. No inflammation was observed in these control quarters and no streptococci were isolated from the milk.

AB  - Many methods for screening and prediction of neonatal septicemia have been tried. In this study a score, related to both perinatal risk factors and neonatal diseases, was tested upon healthy newborn infants, infants with septicemia and infants with other diseases. Statistical differences were found between infants with neonatal septicemia and infants with other neonatal diseases as well as normal newborns. It was also possible to find a relationship between certain predisposing factors and predominance of certain pathogens. Complications during pregnancy and delivery were most often found in the group B streptococcal, combinations of invasive procedures and neonatal diseases in the staphylococcal group and surgical procedures in the gram-negative group.
TI  - Mastitis: I. In vitro antimicrobial activity of alkyl amines against mastitic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of branched and straight chain amines (10 to 18 carbons chain length) were compared in inhibiting the growth of five microorganisms that cause about 95% of bovine mastitis. Three gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria were used in a trypticase soy broth tube culture growth assay. Sixty-two compounds were screened at concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ppm in broth culture to determine the effective minimum inhibitory concentration. Alkyl secondary N-substituted monoethyl [CH3(CH2)nNHCH2CH3] and tertiary N,N-substituted dimethyl [CH3(CH2) nN(CH3)2] amines with chain lengths of 11 to 14 carbon atoms were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Antimicrobial activity against gram-positive organisms increased with increasing chain length and carbon-14 to 18 amines were active at 1 to 5 ppm. The carbon-11 to 13 alkyl amines were most active against gram-positive organisms; longer chain amines (more than 14 carbons) were inactive. Branching of the alkyl chain caused a loss of activity against gram-negative but not against gram-positive bacteria. Antimicrobial testing of monoamines, polyamines, and the influence of order substituents were investigated to correlate structure-acitivity relationships.
TI  - Effect of storage processes on the bacterial growth-inhibiting activity of human  breast milk.
AB  - Human breast milk samples were collected from lactating mothers, and aliquots were maintained at room temperature, frozen, and pasteurized. Samples were inoculated with 10 to 50 colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) of Escherichia coli or group B streptococcus, and incubated at 37 C. Quantitative growth was measured at eight and 24 hours. No inhibitory activity was demonstrated by control broth, commercial formula, and pasteurized breast milk, which had a rapid logarithmic growth to a maximum of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu/ml at 24 hours. Compared with these controls, fresh breast milk, fresh frozen breast milk, and breast milk frozen for 21 days demonstrated a significant inhibition of bacteria growth. A trend toward gradual loss of inhibiting activity was noted with prolonged freezing of breast milk. Although freezing may quantitativly decrease the amount of some breast milk host-defense factors, it cannot be assumed that comparable functional reductions will necessarily result.
TI  - Bacteriological quality control in human milk-banking.
AB  - The bacteriological quality of pooled human milk donated to the Oxford milk bank  was analysed and the effects on bacteriology of sterilisation of the milk-collecting vessels in the home with hypochlorite solution and of Holder pasteurisation in a purpose-built human-milk pasteuriser were studied. Collecting milk in hypochlorite-sterilised vessels resulted in a significantly lower bacterial count of both pathogens and species of unlikely pathogenicity before pasteurisation and significantly increased the chance of pasteurisation giving a sterile product. Potentially pathogenic organisms grown in untreated milk were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci. Seven species of organisms of unlikely pathogenicity were also identified. Pasteurisation eliminated all potential pathogens from milk but did not reliably remove any of the species of unlikely pathogens. Banked human milk may be contaminated with bacteria which are known to be capable of producing lipases, proteases, and decarboxylases. Accurate pasteurisation, together with attention to the sterility of the collecting vessels, results in a bacteriologically safe product that retains many of the protective properties of raw milk.
TI  - Escherichia coli and group B streptococcal infections in experimental animals.
AB  - Small doses of Escherichia coli endotoxin or of viable E. coli caused only a mild illness in pregnant mice but severely impaired fetal development. After intravenous injection and after experimental renal infection E. coli multiplied in placental tissue, causing resorption of the conceptuses and sometimes fetal infection. It is suggested that in humans coliform bacteraemia sometimes results in abortion and premature delivery because of the placental damage brought about by E. coli and its abortifacient endotoxin. Isolates of group B streptococci from various sites in 175 patients varied markedly in their pathogenicity for mice, and pregnant animals were less susceptible to infection than non-pregnant. In late pregnancy streptococci multiplied rapidly in placental tissue, suggesting that the placenta may be a significant focus of infection at the time of delivery. After antibiotic treatment the majority of mice infected with a highly pathogenic strain died but the majority of those infected with a strain of low pathogenicity survived. Preliminary experiments suggest that guinea-pigs and rabbits may be useful for studying the role of maternally derived antibodies in protecting the neonate against group B streptococci.
TI  - [Investigations into the incidence of the various causative agents of mastitis in cattle. Studies done in the ambulatory clinic of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht].
AB  - The clinical and bacteriological findings in every head of cattle treated for clinical mastitis in the Ambulatory Clinic of the Veterinary Faculty of Utrecht University were recorded over a period of twelve months. Cattle affected with mastitis were classified into a number of groups, a classification based on the clinical symptoms shown by the animals. In each of these groups the incidence of the various causative agents of mastitis was determined. Another subject of study was the distribution of the causative agents over the various groups. The high proportion (34 percent) of coliform micro-organisms, isolated from animals affected with acute mastitis and showing symptoms of generalized disease was a striking feature.
TI  - Absence of bacterial adherence in the establishment of experimental mastitis in mice.
AB  - The possibility of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae to the epithelium of the mammary gland was investigated by inoculating them into this gland of mice. S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli did not adhere to alveolar epithelium in suckling or non-suckling mice. S. agalactiae adhered to alveolar epithelium in non-suckling mice but adhesion was not sufficiently strong to withstand suckling. Bacterial adherence probably does not play a significant role in the establishment of mastitis by these organisms.

AB  - The counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure was evaluated under clinical laboratory conditions to determine its validity and comparability with culture methods. The procedure was further evaluated to determine applicability to a variety of clinical samples. An inexpensive set-up was developed to utilize the CIE procedure at bench level. Results indicated the procedure to be sensitive in detecting Haemophilus influenzae, type b, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), group B. The procedure was more sensitive for detection of H. influenzae, type b, than for meningococcus, group B. The authors have confirmed the usefulness of the CIE procedure in the detection of group B streptococci, pneumococci and teichoic acid antibody to Staphylococcus aureus. Detection of Escherichia coli K 1 antigen was also accomplished by CIE. In the authors' laboratory the CIE procedure was superior to culture methods when used for the detection of H. influenzae, type b, and meningococcus group B.
TI  - Hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. IV. Evaluation of teat dips with excised cows' teats.
AB  - Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to contaminate teats excised from cows. Commercially available teat dips were applied for evaluation of comparative germicidal activity. Iodophors, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium dichloro-s-triazenetrione were highly effective against all four test organisms. Quarternary ammonium, chlorhexidine, and cetylpyridinium chloride were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae but not Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bronopol and 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate were marginally effective on the two Gram positive organisms and ineffective on the two Gram negatives. Three of the dips were ineffective against all four pathogens; two were in nonaqueous bases, and the other was a blend of pine oil and antibodies with udder origin. In other trials, iodophor at .3% titratable iodine was highly effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Products containing .5 and 1% iodophor maintained effectiveness after each was used to dip 140 teats under conditions of commercial dairying. Logarithmic reduction in the geometric mean number of organisms recovered from teats was more meaningful for evaluating data than percent reduction.

TI  - Apparatus for pasteurising teat cup liners between cows in a herringbone parlour.
AB  - In a herringbone milking parlour, teat cup liners were deliberately contaminated  in turn with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Sterp uberis. Contamination was achieved by filling the liners with milk that contained 10(6) test organisms per ml. After the clusters had been back-flushed with water at 85 degrees C for five seconds, normal swabbing methods failed to recover any contaminating organisms from the teat liners in 56 tests out of 64. After 10 seconds back-flushing no recoveries were made in the same number of tests. The apparatus developed to effect this back-flushing for a particular herringbone parlour is described, with details of its routine use during milking. For a 100-cow herd, the running cost of such equipment using a five-second back-flush is estimated at no more than 4 pounds per week and, in its present form, would not add more than 10 seconds to the total milking time for each cow. Improvements in design of the apparatus, and in milking techniques arising from the routine use of the device, are also considered.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Selective effect of propolis in the isolation of Listeria monocytogenes (author's transl)].
AB  - Propolis is a substance produced by honeybees. It is inhibitory to some bacteria  species, mainly Gram-positive bacteria, but less inhibitory to Listeria monocytogenes (L.m) than to the other Gram-positive bacteria tested. In order to obtain selective growth of L.m. from contaminated samples, the effect of propolis in plating media and broths on various strains of bacteria was examined. Table I shows the effect of increasing concentrations of propolis in tryptose-agar (TA). L.m. tolerated higher concentrations of propolis than Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus. L.m. grew well in tryptosebroth (TB) that contained 0.15 mg propolis pr. ml medium, while Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus agalactiae were completely inhibited as seen in Table II. Table III shows that when serum was added to the agar, the inhibitory effect was reduced. It can also be seen that Gram-negative bacteria grew quite well on media that contained 0.19 mg propolis pr. ml. To reduce the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, nalidixic acid was added to the medium. Table IV illustrates growth of various species of bacteria in tryptosephosphatebroth (TFB) with or without propolis and nalidixic acid. Most of the strains tested were inhibited, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to some extent faecal streptococci were able to grow in the medium that contained the selective substances. As a conclusion it seems that propolis may be a valuable additive to a medium for the selective isolation of L.m.

TI  - Intramammary infections in a dairy herd with a low incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - In a dairy herd with a low incidence of intrammary infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, clinical mastitis remained a serious problem despite good control of nonclinical mastitis through postmilking teat disinfection and antibiotic therapy of known infected quarters at the end of lactation. During the 2-year study, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0.88 cases/cow-year; 32.2% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 33.5% by gram-negative organisms. Among all new infections detected, 54.1% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 25.7% by gram-negative bacteria. Among new infections, 41.6% occurred during the nonlactating period or within a few days of calving. Incidence of clinical mastitis was highest in the 1st month of lactation. Among 84 gram-negative infections, 42.8% were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 20.2% by Escherichia coli, and 23.8% by Enterobacter spp. Among the many serotypes of K pneumoniae and E coli, none was predominant.
TI  - Natural history of neonatal colonization with group B streptococci.
AB  - Thirteen percent of the newborns in our study group were colonized with group B streptococci on day 3. This colonization rate appeared constant during the first two weeks of life and then decreased to 5%. Of the babies colonized on day 3, 59% and 91% were culture-negative on days 14 and 42, respectively. Sixty-five percent of the babies carrying group B streptococci on day 14 acquired this microorganism following discharge (day 3). Babies colonized with staphylococci or Escherichia coli were found to have decreased probability of colonization with group B streptococci.
TI  - Culture and treatment results in endometritis following elective abortion.
AB  - Endometrial culture and treatment results from 228 patients who developed endometritis following elective abortion were analyzed. The most common organisms isolated were group B beta hemolytic streptococci, Bacteroides, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. In general, patients responded to treatment with penicillin or ampicillin, with the addition of an aminoglycoside for these requiring hospitalization. Curettage was an important adjunctive treatment for hospitalized patients and for some outpatients.

AB  - The experience with neonatal sepsis at The Johns Hopkins Hospital during 1969-1975 was reviewed. Major pathogens included Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, other streptococci, and Klebsiella. Nineteen percent of coliform isolates were kanamycin-resistant. The frequency of recovery of E. coli was increased in early-onset sepsis, and the frequency of recovery of Klebsiella was increased in late-onset sepsis. The mortality rate was 23%. The frequency of recovery of E. coli was increased in fatal cases, and mortality was highly correlated with the presence of gastrointestinal catastrophe. Ampicillin and gentamicin are the initial antibiotics of choice for neonatal sepsis at this institution; a penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be added when Staphylococcus aureus involvement is likely, and addition of chloramphenicol or clindamycin should be considered for infants at increased risk for Bacteroides fragilis sepsis.
TI  - Effect of amniotic fluid on bacterial growth.
AB  - The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was studied using four pathogenic organisms which are encountered in the perinatal period, E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and Group B beta hemolytic streptococci. Amniotic fluid inhibited the growth of all four organisms, with a wide degree of individual variation among specimens. The greatest degree of inhibition was noted for L. monocytogenes and the least for E. coli. The time in gestation in which the amniotic fluid sample was obtained did not appear to be related to its bacteriostatic capacity. The ability of amniotic fluid to inhibit the growth of certain pathogenic organisms may be significant in prevention of perinatal infection.
TI  - [Infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with Klebsiella mastitis].
AB  - The infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of Klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. The following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from milk samples 28 and 31 times, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, Staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, Enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and Escherichia coli twice. The authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. Double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected Klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); However, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. The final deduction concerning the exogenic character of Klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - Cytologic features of bone marrow in normal and mastitic cows.
AB  - Rib bone marrow was aspirated from normal cows and from cows with experimentally  induced or naturally acquired mastitis. Nucleated cell counts in marrow films were made on the basis of differentiation of 500 cells. The myeloid/erythroid ratio was less than 1.0 in normal cows and generally greater than 1.0 in mastitic cows. The marrow reserve of mature neutrophils was nearly depleted in response to experimentally induced Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis (4th postinoculation day) or in an acute flare-up of naturally acquired Str agalactiae mastitis. A dose of 0.05 mg of Escherichia coli endotoxin, introduced into a single, normal, lactating quarter produced similar results within 8 hours. Concurrently, with depletion of marrow reserves of mature neutrophils, a neutropenia with left shift developed in the blood, and immature granulocytes increased in the marrow. The intensification of granulopoiesis returned the marrow reserves to normal or above normal within a period of 4 to 5 days, thereby reestablishing homeostasis.

AB  - Vaginal epithelial cells from healthy women were washed and incubated in tissue culture medium with freshly isolated bacteria of the indigenous vaginal flora and with bacteria of species that have been discussed in conjunction with genital infections. After incubation and washing, the number of bacteria that adhered per cell was determined. The influence on the attachment rate of such factors as variations in the washing procedure, bacterial density, and incubation time was assessed. Lactobacillus acidophilus and other bacterial species that occur in the lower genital tract of healthy women, e.g., some strictly anaerobic species, adhered by significantly lower numbers per cell than Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group B streptococci, and Corynebacterium vaginale. Significantly more freshly isolated gonococci adhered per cell than gonococci that had been passaged on artificial medium. The adherence of gonococci increased with increasing acidity of the test medium.
TI  - Immunochemical characterization of the "native" type III polysaccharide of group  B Streptococcus.
AB  - The type III polysaccharide of -roup B Streptococcus has been isolated and purified by a method that employs washing of intact cells at neutral pH. That the polysaccharide prepared by this procedure is the "native" type III antigen is suggested by its molecular size in excess of 10(6) daltons, its degradation by acid and heat treatment to a fragment with immunologic characteristics of the classical HCl antigen, and its type-specific serologic activity. The type III polysaccharide in native form contains sialic acid, galactose, glucose, glucosamine, heptose, and mannose. It is acidic in nature, is resistant to neuramindiase degradation, contains no O-acetyl groups, and does not share antigenic determinants with capsular type K1 antigen of Escherichia coli or Group B polysaccharide antigen of Neiserria meningitidis.
TI  - Meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  - Colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. Among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Since the microcontour of the canine distal urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina. The normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. It consisted principally of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. Estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-Streptococcus and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. A normal canine transient, Escherichia coli, and a normal resident, Corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. In contrast, human Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus (8.5 days). The commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. Thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the susceptibility to colonization.

TI  - Selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. S. agalactiae and S. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered poorly or not at all. The organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. These data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.
TI  - [Etiology of dairy cows mastitis in Slovakia in the years 1972-1974].
AB  - In the period from 1972 to 1974, veterinary institutes in Slovakia performed bacteriological examinations in 178,853 milk samples coming from 72,454 dairy cows. On an annual average, the number of examined samples were higher by 61% than in 1967-1971. Germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 22.32% of the dairy cows. The following bacterial germs were represented: Streptococcus agalactiae -- 15.77%, Staphylococcus aureus -- 4.19%, other streptococci -- 1.49%, E. coli -- 0.18%, Klebsiella sp. -- 0.23%, Corynebacterium pyogenes -- 0.20%, other germs -- 0.26%. The number of dairy cows having bacterial germs in their milk was found higher by 1.47% than in 1967-1971. The number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae was higher by 3.29% and that of Staphylococcus aureus by 1.15% than in the period from 1967 to 1971. The higher number of the findings of the bacterial causative agents responsible for mastitis was due, in particular, to the increased number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae in milk.

AB  - The incidence and ype of aerobic bacteria causing intramammary infection (IMI) in two groups of peripartum sows were determined. The incidence of IMI in 24 sows near farrowing was 30.2 percent; the incidence in 16 machine-milked sows was 81.0 percent. Numerous mixed IMI were detected. The bacterium causing most IMI was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by beta hemolytic streptococci, aslpha hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids. The beta hemolytic streptococci and E. coli cultures were studied in detail. The relationship of bacterial IMI to agalactiae toxemia is discussed.

Preparation of the medium, which is stable for up to 4 weeks at 4 C, is simple and inexpensive. Use of such a medium should facilitate identification of vaginal colonization with group B streptococci.

TI  - Cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group D streptococci.
AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
