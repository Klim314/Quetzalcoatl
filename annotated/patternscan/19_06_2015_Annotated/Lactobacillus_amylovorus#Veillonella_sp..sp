TI  == microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  == it is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. pyrosequencing targeting the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. the bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. clustering and venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. traditional fecal indicators, i.e., escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. besides the bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., parasutterella excrementihominis, veillonella sp., dialister invisus, megamonas funiformis, and ruminococcus lactaris for the human and lactobacillus amylovorus and atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. these microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent  on the absence or presence of a single indicator. monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
