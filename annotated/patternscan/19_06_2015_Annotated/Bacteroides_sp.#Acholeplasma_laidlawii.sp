TI  == phenatic acids a and b, new potentiators of antifungal miconazole activity produced by streptomyces sp. k03-0132.
AB  == two new phenols, designated phenatic acids a and b, were isolated along with known actiphenol, from the culture of streptomyces sp. k03-0132 by solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography and hplc. their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including mainly various nmr experiments. they have a common 1-hydroxy 2, 4-dimethyl benzene ring. these compounds potentiate miconazole activity against candida albicans. phenatic acid b also showed moderate antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus  aureus, bacteroides fragilis and acholeplasma laidlawii.
