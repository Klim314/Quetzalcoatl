TI  - The antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (COS) and low molar mass chitosans  (LMWC) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (CS) hydrolysates. Here, we show the in vitro effect of different COS, LMWC, and CS on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary CS products by humans. Specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Roseburia intestinalis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% COS (2, 3, and 6 kDa), 0.025 and 0.05% of LMWC (10 and 16 kDa), and 0.025 and 0.1% of CS in vitro. The growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of COS and LMWC in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. A relatively higher resistance to CS hydrolyzates was detected in R. intestinalis and F. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to Bacteoides sp. and Clostridium sp. The antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. The antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (DP). MIC ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and DP of CS/LMWC. MBC also decreased with DP. The most effective antimicrobial action was detected in LMWC with 16 kDa and CS. Weak antimicrobial activity was found in COS with small molecules (2 and 3 kDa).
TI  - Effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  - Duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. A panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-Ruminococcus bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides, and Eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. Nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and E. cylindroides. The ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. The Roseburia-related strain A2-183(F) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding. In contrast, Roseburia intestinalis L1-82(R) and Eubacterium sp. strain A2-194(R) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that A2-194(R) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. These results suggest that many low-G+C-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. Thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics from their effects in vitro.
TI  - Roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., a novel saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  - Five strains of butyrate-producing, anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria were isolated from human faecal material. These strains were slightly curved rods that showed motility by means of multiple subterminal flagella. The DNA G + C content of the strains was 29-31 mol%. A detailed investigation of the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the strains revealed that they represent a novel species of anaerobic, low-G+C-content, butyrate-producing bacterium that shows net acetate utilization during growth on media containing carbohydrates and short-chain fatty acids. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the five isolates were determined and they confirmed that these strains were closely related to each other. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most closely related species are Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium oxidoreducens and Roseburia cecicola, members of cluster XIVa of the Clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, although they share less than 95% sequence identity with the novel strains. It is proposed that a novel species, Roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., be created, with strain L1-82T (= DSM 14610T = NCIMB 13810T) as the type strain.
