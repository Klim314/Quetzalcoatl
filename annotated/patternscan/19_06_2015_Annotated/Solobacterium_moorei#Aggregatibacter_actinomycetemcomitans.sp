TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == a 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB  == aim: supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. this study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (gi) on dental implants and peri-implant  tissues. materials and methods: one hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. at baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, gi and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. results: subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). there were significantly fewer gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, solobacterium moorei, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and gi.

TI  == analysis of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis using 16s rrna gene clone library.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis (pi) is an inflammatory disease which leads to the destruction of soft and hard tissues around osseointegrated implants. the subgingival microbiota appears to be responsible for peri-implant lesions and although the complexity of the microbiota has been reported in pi, the microbiota responsible for pi has not been identified. objective: the purpose of this study  was to identify the microbiota in subjects who have pi, clinically healthy implants, and periodontitis-affected teeth using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis to clarify the microbial differences. design: three subjects participated in this study. the conditions around the teeth and implants were evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations and diseased implants,  clinically healthy implants, and periodontally diseased teeth were selected. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets using sterile paper points. prevalence and identity of bacteria was analyzed using a 16s rrna gene clone library technique. results: a total of 112 different species were identified from 335 clones sequenced. among the 112 species, 51 (46%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel phylotypes. the numbers of bacterial species identified at the sites of pi, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively. microbiota in pi mainly included gram-negative species and the composition was more diverse when compared to that of the healthy implant and periodontitis. the phyla chloroflexi, tenericutes, and synergistetes were only detected at pi sites, as were parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus stomatis, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and solobacterium moorei. low levels of periodontopathic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were seen in  peri-implant lesions. conclusions: the biofilm in pi showed a more complex microbiota when compared to periodontitis and periodontally healthy teeth, and it was mainly composed of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. common periodontopathic  bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in pi.
