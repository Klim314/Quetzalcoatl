TI  == pd-140248 (parke-davis & co).
AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem wy-49605 (sun5555) against recent clinical isolates from five u.s. medical centers.
AB  == the in vitro activity of wy-49605 (sun5555) (wy) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by wy (mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [mic50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). mic90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp., and proteus mirabilis. wy was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml)  and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). the four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. at  2.0 micrograms/ml, wy inhibited 82% of enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of cp-99,219, a novel azabicyclo-naphthyridone.
AB  == cp-99,219 is a trifluoronaphthyridone with significant antibacterial activity that includes the family enterobacteriaceae (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], < or = 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus  influenzae, and gonococci (mics, < or = 0.015 micrograms/ml). legionella spp. were also cp-99,219 susceptible, with mics of 0.008 to 0.12 micrograms/ml. cp-99,219 demonstrated activity greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or enoxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), xanthomonas maltophilia (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), and pneumococci (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were susceptible to cp-99,219, a new compound showing potential value for further in vivo trials.
