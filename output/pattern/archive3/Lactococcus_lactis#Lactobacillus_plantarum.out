characterization of some bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented foods.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from different sources (dairy products, fruits, fresh and fermented vegetables, fermented cereals) were screened for antimicrobial activity against other bacteria, including potential pathogens and food spoiling bacteria. six strains have been shown to produce bacteriocins: lactococcus lactis 19.3, lactobacillus plantarum 26.1, enterococcus durans 41.2, isolated from dairy products and lactobacillus amylolyticus p40 and p50, and lactobacillus oris p49, isolated from bors. among the six bacteriocins, there were both heat stable, low molecular mass polypeptides, with a broad inhibitory spectrum, probably belonging to class ii bacteriocins, and heat labile, high molecular mass proteins, with a very narrow inhibitory spectrum, most probably belonging to class iii bacteriocins. a synergistic effect of some bacteriocins mixtures was observed. we can conclude that fermented foods are still important sources of new functional lab. among the six characterized bacteriocins, there might be some novel compounds with interesting features. moreover, the bacteriocin-producing strains isolated in our study may find applications as protective cultures.
plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
isolation of pediococcus acidilactici kp10 with ability to secrete bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from milk products for applications in food industry.
background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) can be isolated from traditional milk products. lab that secrete substances that inhibit pathogenic bacteria and are resistant to acid, bile, and pepsin but not vancomycin may have potential in food applications. results: lab isolated from a range of traditional fermented products were screened for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. a total of 222 lab strains were isolated from fermented milk products in the form of fresh curds, dried curds, and ghara (a traditional flavor enhancer prepared from whey), and fermented cocoa bean. eleven lab isolates that produced antimicrobial substances were identified as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and pediococcus acidilactici strains by biochemical methods and 16s rdna gene sequencing. of these, the cell-free supernatant of kp10 (p. acidilactici) most strongly inhibited listeria monocytogenes. further analysis identified the antimicrobial substance produced by kp10 as proteinaceous in nature and active over a wide ph range. kp10 (p. acidilactici) was found to be catalase-negative, able to produce beta-galactosidase, resistant to bile salts (0.3%) and acidic conditions (ph 3), and susceptible to most antibiotics. conclusion: traditionally prepared fermented milk products are good sources of lab with characteristics suitable for industrial applications. the isolate kp10 (p. acidilactici) shows potential for the production of probiotic and functional foods.
characterization of the structural gene encoding nisin f, a new lantibiotic produced by a lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate from freshwater catfish (clarias gariepinus).
lactococcus lactis f10, isolated from freshwater catfish, produces a bacteriocin  (bacf) active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. the operon encoding bacf is located on a plasmid. sequencing of the structural gene revealed no homology to other nisin genes. nisin f is described.
racemization of l-lactic acid in ph-swing open fermentation of kitchen refuse by  selective proliferation of lactobacillus plantarum.
we have shown that stable lactic acid fermentation of model kitchen refuse occurs with intermittent ph adjustment under nonsterilized conditions. nonetheless, the optical activity of the accumulated lactic acid was low, which is disadvantageous for the production of high-quality poly-l-lactic acid. here, we attempt to increase optical purity by introducing l-lactic acid-producing strains under nonsterilized conditions and demonstrate that the inoculation of lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactococcus lactis, both of which are l-lactic acid producers, is partially effective in the early fermentation stage, but does not improve the final optical purity of the accumulated lactic acid. we confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using group-specific and species-specific 16s rdna probes that this is due to the selective proliferation of naturally existing l. plantarum. l. plantarum ky-1, which is isolated from model kitchen refuse, showing lactic acid racemase activity, as well as d-lactate dehydrogenase activity, in its membrane fraction. we conclude that racemase activity associated with l. plantarum is the main cause of decreased optical purity in the accumulated lactic acid.
lactate racemization as a rescue pathway for supplying d-lactate to the cell wall biosynthesis machinery in lactobacillus plantarum.
lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that produces d- and l-lactate using stereospecific nad-dependent lactate dehydrogenases (ldhd and ldhl, respectively). however, reduction of glycolytic pyruvate by ldhd is not the only pathway for d-lactate production since a mutant defective in this activity still produces both lactate isomers (t. ferain, j. n. hobbs, jr., j. richardson, n. bernard, d. garmyn, p. hols, n. e. allen, and j. delcour, j. bacteriol. 178:5431-5437, 1996). production of d-lactate in this species has been shown to be connected to cell wall biosynthesis through its incorporation as the last residue of the muramoyl-pentadepsipeptide peptidoglycan precursor. this particular feature leads to natural resistance to high concentrations of vancomycin. in the present study, we show that l. plantarum possesses two pathways for d-lactate production: the ldhd enzyme and a lactate racemase, whose expression requires l-lactate. we report the cloning of a six-gene operon, which is involved in lactate racemization activity and is positively regulated by l-lactate. deletion of this operon in an l. plantarum strain that is devoid of ldhd activity leads to the exclusive production of l-lactate. as a consequence, peptidoglycan biosynthesis is affected, and growth of this mutant is d-lactate dependent. we also show that the growth defect can be partially restored by expression of the d-alanyl-d-alanine-forming ddl ligase from lactococcus lactis, or by supplementation with various d-2-hydroxy acids but not d-2-amino acids, leading to variable vancomycin resistance levels. this suggests that l. plantarum is unable to efficiently synthesize peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-alanine and that the cell wall biosynthesis machinery in this species is specifically dedicated to the production of peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-lactate. in this context, the lactate racemase could thus provide the bacterium with a rescue pathway for d-lactate production upon inactivation or inhibition of the ldhd enzyme.
in situ activity of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis strain. influence  on the interactions between lactic acid bacteria during sourdough fermentation.
aims: to biochemically characterize the bacteriocin produced by lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m30 and demonstrate its effect on lactic acid bacteria (lab) during sourdough propagation. methods and results: a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by l. lactis ssp. lactis m30 was purified by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction and reversed phase chromatography. mass spectrometry of the two peptides and sequence analysis of the ltna2 gene showed that the bacteriocin was almost identical to lacticin 3147. during a 20-day period of sourdough propagation the stability of l. lactis m30 was demonstrated, with concomitant inhibition of the indicator strain lactobacillus plantarum 20, as well as the non-interference with the growth of the starter strain lact. sanfranciscensis cb1. conclusions: in situ active bacteriocins influence the microbial consortium of sourdough lab and can "support" the dominance of insensitive strains during sourdough fermentation. significance and impact of the study: the in situ bacteriocinogenic activity of selected lactococci enables the persistence of insensitive lact. sanfranciscensis strains, useful to confer good characteristics to the dough, at a higher cell concentration with respect to other lab of the same ecosystem.
characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
high-level gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum using a pheromone-regulated bacteriocin promoter.
aims: to use promoters and regulatory genes involved in the production of the bacteriocin sakacin p to obtain high-level regulated gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum. methods and results: in a plasmid containing all three operons naturally involved in sakacin p production, the genes encoding sakacin p and its immunity protein were replaced by the aminopeptidase n gene from lactococcus lactis (pepn) or the beta-glucuronidase gene from escherichia coli (gusa). the new genes were precisely fused to the start codon of the sakacin p gene and the stop codon of the immunity gene. this set-up permitted regulated (external pheromone controlled) overexpression of both reporter genes in l. plantarum nc8. for pepn, production levels amounted to as much as 40% of total cellular protein. conclusions: promoters and regulatory genes involved in production of sakacin p are suitable for establishing inducible high-level gene expression in l. plantarum. significance and impact of the study: this study describes a system for controllable gene expression in lactobacilli, giving some of the highest expression levels reported so far in this genus.
intra-specific variation of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus pentosus in sensitivity towards various bacteriocins.
fifty-two strains belonging to the lactobacillus plantarum species group were identified and typed. they represented 32 clones of lactobacillus plantarum and 7 clones of lactobacillus pentosus. sensitivity of all strains towards bacteriocins of four different producer strains was investigated using a deferred inhibition test (dit). substantial intra-specific variation in sensitivity of clones was observed towards bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria producing nisin ( lactococcus lactis atcc 11454) or pediocin pa-1 ( pediococcus acidilactici pac-1.0), while none of the strains were sensitive towards the two remaining bacteriocin producers. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of nisin towards selected strains confirmed the dit results. no correlation between the susceptibility of fourteen selected strains towards nisin and an array of antibiotics was found. the present study indicates that the variation in bacteriocin-sensitivity within target species might be a potential limitation for the application of bacteriocins as biopreservatives.
use of bacteriocin promoters for gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum c11.
aims: to exploit promoters involved in production of the bacteriocin sakacin p for regulated overexpression of genes in lactobacillus plantarum c11. methods and results: production of sakacin p by lact. sakei lth673 is controlled by a peptide-based quorum sensing system that drives strong, regulated promoters. one of these promoters (porfx) was used to establish regulated overexpression of genes encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from bacillus pumilus, aminopeptidase n from lactococcus lactis or chitinase b from serratia marcescens in lact. plantarum c11, a strain that naturally possesses the regulatory machinery that is necessary for promoter activation. the expression levels obtained were highly dependent on which gene was used and on how the promoter was coupled to this gene. the highest expression levels (14% of total cellular protein) were obtained with the aminopeptidase n gene translationally fused to the regulated promoter. conclusions: sakacin promoters permit regulated expression of a variety of genes in lact. plantarum c11. significance and impact of the study: this study shows the usefulness of regulated bacteriocin promoters for developing new gene expression systems for lactic acid bacteria, in particular lactobacilli.
induction of plantaricin production in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 after coculture with specific gram-positive bacteria is mediated by an autoinduction mechanism.
plantaricin nc8 (plnc8), a coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum nc8, has recently been purified and genetically characterized. analysis of an 8.1-kb nc8 dna region downstream of the plnc8 operon revealed the presence of at least four operons involved in bacteriocin production, showing high homology to the plantaricin cluster in l. plantarum c11. however, we found a three-component regulatory operon involving a quorum-sensing mechanism. two of these components, the induction factor (plnc8if) and the histidine kinase, are novel, while the response regulator is identical to plnd from c11. homologous expression of plnc8if in nc8 allowed constitutive bacteriocin production. heterologous expression of this gene in lactococcus lactis mg1363 produced supernatants which promoted bacteriocin production in nc8. reverse transcription-pcr studies indicated that cocultivation of nc8 with inducing cells promoted transcription of the bacteriocin and regulatory operons in nc8. an identical result was obtained after addition of an external source of plnc8if. we propose that the presence of specific bacteria could act as an environmental signal that is able to switch on bacteriocin production in l. plantarum nc8 via a quorum-sensing mechanism mediated by plnc8if.
purification and genetic characterization of plantaricin nc8, a novel coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum nc8.
a new, coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin named plantaricin nc8 (plnc8)  was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum nc8 cultures which had been induced with lactococcus lactis mg1363 or pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63. this bacteriocin consists of two distinct peptides, named alpha and beta, which were separated by c(2)-c(18) reverse-phase chromatography and whose complementary action is necessary for full plantaricin nc8 activity. n-terminal sequencing of both purified peptides showed 28 and 34 amino acids residues for plnc8 alpha and plnc8 beta, respectively, which showed no sequence similarity to other known bacteriocins. mass spectrometry analysis showed molecular masses of 3,587 da (alpha) and 4,000 da (beta). the corresponding genes, designated plnc8a and plnc8b, were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences revealed that both peptides are produced as bacteriocin precursors of 47 and 55 amino acids, respectively, which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the mature alpha and beta peptides contain 29 and 34 amino acids, respectively. an open reading frame, orfc, which encodes a putative immunity protein was found downstream of plnc8b and overlapping plnc8a. upstream of the putative -35 region of plnc8b, two direct repeats of 9 bp were identified, which agrees with the consensus sequence and structure of promoters of class ii bacteriocin operons whose expression is dependent on an autoinduction mechanism.
molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.
adaptation of the nisin-controlled expression system in lactobacillus plantarum:  a tool to study in vivo biological effects.
the potential of lactic acid bacteria as live vehicles for the production and delivery of therapeutic molecules is being actively investigated today. for future applications it is essential to be able to establish dose-response curves for the targeted biological effect and thus to control the production of a heterologous biopeptide by a live lactobacillus. we therefore implemented in lactobacillus plantarum ncimb8826 the powerful nisin-controlled expression (nice) system based on the autoregulatory properties of the bacteriocin nisin, which is produced by lactococcus lactis. the original two-plasmid nice system turned out to be poorly suited to l. plantarum. in order to obtain a stable and reproducible nisin dose-dependent synthesis of a reporter protein (beta-glucuronidase) or a model antigen (the c subunit of the tetanus toxin, ttfc), the lactococcal nisrk regulatory genes were integrated into the chromosome of l. plantarum ncimb8826. moreover, recombinant l. plantarum producing increasing amounts of ttfc was used to establish a dose-response curve after subcutaneous administration to mice. the induced serum immunoglobulin g response was correlated with the dose of antigen delivered by the live lactobacilli.
effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
the impact of a novel type of modified atmosphere (ma), referred to as high o2-ma, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. pure cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter agglomerans, aureobacterium strain 27, candida guilliermondii, c. sake, salmonella typhimurium, salm. enteritidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees c under an atmosphere composed of o2 (80 or 90%, balanced with n2), co2 (10 or 20%, balanced with n2), or a combination of both gases. in general, exposure to high o2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while co2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in combination. with minimally-processed vegetables, where co2 levels of around 20% or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high o2 and 10-20% co2 may provide adequate suppression of microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.
bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
the bacteriocinogenicity of lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 43200, p. pentosaceus atcc 43201, lactobacillus plantarum bn, l. plantarum lb592, l. plantarum lb75, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 against clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees c was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. all the strains, except l. acidophilus n2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of c. botulinum spores at 30 degrees c. l. plantarum bn, l. lactis atcc 11454, and p. pentosaceus atcc 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees c. supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% nacl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of l. plantarum bn and l. lactis atcc 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees c. these results suggest that low levels of l. plantarum bn or l. lactis atcc 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% nacl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk with special reference  to the biodegradation of casein fractions.
streptococci and lactobacilli were assayed for their proteolytic activity in pasteurised (95 degrees c for 30 min) fresh friesian cows' skim milk incubated at 30 degrees c for 48 h. lactobacilli were more proteolytic than the streptococci except s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens. s. faecalis and s. thermophilus followed s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis in the proteolytic activity. electrophoretic analysis of the precipitated casein revealed k-, pre-beta- and the small slow band of alpha s1-casein to be the most fractions and beta-casein the least fraction susceptible to the biodegradation. s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was the only organism able to degrade beta-casein to 3 fractions within 48 h. s. lactis with its subsp. diacetylactis was characterized by its inability to degrade gamma-casein. addition of 2.0 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 2.0 mmol mg2+, 0.5 mmol mn2+ and 0.1 mmol fe2+/l of skim milk culture of each l. casei and l. plantarum increased acid formation but decreased proteolysis. 6% nacl was inhibitory to both. after 60 days at 18 degrees c, a fraction, probably derived from beta-casein, was noticeable. the large intense band of alpha s1-casein appears to be degraded gradually to only small peptides which in turn are transferred immediately into the cells. the hydrolysis of gamma-casein and beta-casein also appears to be inhibited by exogenously supplied nacl and nutrients, respectively.
