antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.
bacteriophage-mediated control of a two-species biofilm formed by microorganisms  causing catheter-associated urinary tract infections in an in vitro urinary catheter model.
microorganisms from a patient or their environment may colonize indwelling urinary catheters, forming biofilm communities on catheter surfaces and increasing patient morbidity and mortality. this study investigated the effect of pretreating hydrogel-coated silicone catheters with mixtures of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis bacteriophages on the development of single- and two-species biofilms in a multiday continuous-flow in vitro model using artificial urine. novel phages were purified from sewage, characterized, and screened for their abilities to reduce biofilm development by clinical isolates of their respective hosts. our screening data showed that artificial urine medium (aum) is a valid substitute for human urine for the purpose of evaluating uropathogen biofilm control by these bacteriophages. defined phage cocktails targeting p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis were designed based on the biofilm inhibition screens. hydrogel-coated catheters were pretreated with one or both cocktails and challenged with approximately 1x10(3) cfu/ml of the corresponding pathogen(s). the biofilm growth on the catheter surfaces in aum was monitored over 72 to 96 h. phage pretreatment reduced p. aeruginosa biofilm counts by 4 log10 cfu/cm2 (p</=0.01) and p. mirabilis biofilm counts by >2 log10 cfu/cm2 (p</=0.01) over 48 h. the presence of p. mirabilis was always associated with an increase in lumen ph from 7.5 to 9.5 and with eventual blockage of the reactor lines. the results of this study suggest that pretreatment of a hydrogel urinary catheter with a phage cocktail can significantly reduce mixed-species biofilm formation by clinically relevant bacteria.
wild mushroom extracts as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation.
microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. these microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. the use of natural products has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. the present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. four gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of russula delica, fistulina hepatica, mycena rosea, leucopaxilus giganteus, and lepista nuda extracts. the results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). among the five tested extracts against e. coli, leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. the extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon p. mirabilis biofilm formation were sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and russula delica (53.1%). acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by russula delica extract). this is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.

objective: to determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from mentha longifolia l. (m. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of zataria multiflora boiss. (z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysenteriae, klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumonia), enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of m. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. results: the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) were observed by the aqueous extracts of m. longifolia. conclusions: in conclusion, it seems that z. multiflora and m. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.
anti-biofilm activity of biogenic selenium nanoparticles and selenium dioxide against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of biologically synthesized selenium nanoparticles (se nps) against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial strains compared to that of selenium dioxide. thirty strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were isolated from various specimens of the patients hospitalized in different hospitals (kerman, iran). quantification of the biofilm using microtiter plate assay method introduced 30% of s. aureus, 13% of p. aeruginosa and 17% of p. mirabilis isolates as severely adherent strains. transmission electron micrograph (tem) of the purified se nps (produced by bacillus sp. msh-1) showed individual and spherical nano-structure in the size range of 80-220nm. obtained results of the biofilm formation revealed that selenium nanoparticles inhibited the biofilm of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and p. mirabilis by 42%, 34.3%, and 53.4%, respectively, compared to that of the non-treated samples. effect of temperature and ph on the biofilm formation in the presence of se nps and seo2 was also evaluated.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.
ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in european and united states hospitals (2012).
ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (iai), complicated urinary tract infections (uti) and ventilator-associated pneumonia. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing iai and healthcare-associated uti (hca-uti). the organisms were consecutively collected from january to december 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the united states (usa) and 15 european countries by the program to assess ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility (pacts). the collection included 809 organisms from iai and 2474 organisms from hca-uti, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) m07-a9 document. overall, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against e. coli (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (mdr; mic50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/l) and esbl-phenotype strains (mic50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/l). ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most k. pneumoniae strains (mic50/90, 0.25/16 mg/l, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l), but some esbl-phenotype (mic50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/l) and mdr (mic50/90, 16/>32 mg/l) isolates exhibited elevated mic values. ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mg/l; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/l) and retained potency against many mdr (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2/>32 mg/l) strains. ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against klebsiella oxytoca (mic50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), enterobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/l), citrobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/l), proteus mirabilis (mic50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/l), indole-positive proteae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), and serratia spp. (mic50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/l). in summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic gram-negative pathogens causing iai and hca-uti in usa and european medical centers.
antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.
recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
background: bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. this study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. methods: recombinant lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees c. results: results revealed that lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/ml s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and e. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. at this concentration, lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) cfu/ml staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. conclusion: recombinant lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
inhibition of biofilm development of uropathogens by curcumin - an anti-quorum sensing agent from curcuma longa.
urinary tract infection is caused primarily by the quorum sensing (qs)-dependent  biofilm forming ability of uropathogens. in the present investigation, an anti-quorum sensing (anti-qs) agent curcumin from curcuma longa (turmeric) was shown to inhibit the biofilm formation of uropathogens, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, possibly by interfering with their qs systems. the antibiofilm potential of curcumin on uropathogens as well as its efficacy in disturbing the mature biofilms was examined under light microscope and confocal laser scanning microscope. the treatment with curcumin was also found to attenuate the qs-dependent factors, such as exopolysaccharide production, alginate production, swimming and swarming motility of uropathogens. furthermore, it was documented that curcumin enhanced the susceptibility of a marker strain and uropathogens to conventional antibiotics.
frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteremia isolates in patients with urinary tract infection: results from united states and european hospitals (2009-2011).
we evaluated the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients with uti from european (eu) and united states (usa) hospitals during a 3-year period (2009-2011). susceptibility testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution method on 2071 gram-negative bacilli. the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (63.3/71.3% in usa/eu), klebsiella spp. (16.7/11.2%) and proteus mirabilis (6.4/5.0%). escherichia coli susceptibility rates were generally similar in the usa and eu, with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype rates at 8.1% in both regions. among klebsiella spp., esbl rates varied from 11.4/17.1% in 2009 to 16.1/40.4% in 2011 in usa/eu, and susceptibility rates were generally lower in eu compared to the usa. pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited lower susceptibility rates to ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam in eu (78.4, 78.4 and 76.5%, respectively) compared to usa (91.2, 88.2 and 91.2%, respectively). in summary, very few antimicrobials provided satisfactory coverage (>90%) when tested against klebsiella spp. and p. aeruginosa isolates in eu.
antimicrobial activity and phytochemical constituents of leaf extracts of cassia  auriculata.
plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'for centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. in the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). the aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). the extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. the antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from cassia auriculata.
convenient syntheses of cyanuric chloride-derived nhc ligands, their ag(i) and au(i) complexes and antimicrobial activity.
convenient syntheses of mono- and bis-imidazolium 1,3,5-triazine derivatives bearing piperidine and morpholine substituents are reported. in situ deprotonation of the mono-imidazolium salts and reaction with ag2o or au(tht)cl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) precursors affords the corresponding ag(nhc)cl and au(nhc)cl carbene complexes. in the presence of ag(i) or au(i) salts the bis-imidazolium pincers eliminate the imidazolium group to afford -ome or -nme2 substituted triazines depending on the solvent used. in solution, the ag(i) and au(i) complexes show a barrier to rotation about the ctriazine-namine bonds, with calculated deltag( not equal) barriers in the region of 70 kj mol(-1). single crystal x-ray structures of several of the proligands and their corresponding ag(i) and au(i) complexes were obtained. these universally reveal an extended, rigidly planar pi-conjugated network between the triazine core, imidazolium/imidazolylidene substituents and exocyclic amine functions, to which the origin of the rotational barrier observed in solution is attributed. only very weak ntriazine-metal interactions are observed in the solid state, as indicated by small deviations of the cnhc-ag-cl bond angles from 180 degrees and also supported by dft calculations on the ag(nhc)cl complex (nhc = 4,6-dipiperidinyl-2-methylimidazolylidene triazine). preliminary antimicrobial susceptibility studies against five microorganisms (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus nctc 13277, s. aureus nctc 6571, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 10662, proteus mirabilis nctc 11938 and candida albicans atcc 90028) show that the above triazine-based ag-nhc complexes are active antimicrobial and antifungal agents.
antimicrobial activity of willowherb (epilobium angustifolium l.) leaves and flowers.
since the aetiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bhp) is still unknown, the use of medicinal herb extracts and products prepared thereof are recommended due to their antimicrobial activity, especially during early stages of bhp. a comparison was performed of the in vitro antimicrobial activity (using broth microdilution assay) of flowers and leaves of willowherb (epilobium angustifolium l., onagraceae) from mt. velebit (croatia). the strains (standard atcc and clinical isolates) of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli (including p-fimbriae positive strain), pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, candida albicans, c. tropicalis, c. dubliniensis and saccharomyces cerevisiae were susceptible with mic values between 4.6+/-0.2 and 18.2+/-0.8 mg/ml. the results of in vitro studies showed that no differences were found in the antimicrobial activity between the ethanol extracts of leaves and flowers of e. angustifolium. using the quantitative fluorescent assay with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, the viability of c. albicans atcc 10231 was assessed after in vitro exposure to e. angustifolium leaf and flower ethanol extracts. apoptosis of c. albicans blastospores dominated over necrosis in all treated samples after short-term exposure with 6 to 12 mg/ml of extracts. in addition to the valuable biological activity of e. angustifolium extracts, the data obtained from the in vitro diffusion, the dilution assay and antifungal viability fluorescent assay suggest that leaf and flower ethanol extracts of e. angustifolium l. are a promising complementary herbal therapy of conditions such as bhp.
the joint in vitro action of polymyxin b and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three european countries.
background: canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. for topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. hypothesis/objectives: this study was conducted to elucidate the in vitro activity of polymyxin b and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates from three european countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. animals: seventeen strains of escherichia coli, 24 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in germany, france and italy. methods: drug activities were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration. the potentiation of polymyxin b plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). an fici </=0.5 defined synergy. furthermore, geographical variations in the fici and mic were assessed by statistical analysis. results: bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different european countries, because there were no significant mic and fici variations (p > 0.05). as a single agent, polymyxin b had bactericidal activity against most e. coli and p. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against s. pseudintermedius strains. miconazole was bactericidal against all staphylococcus strains. synergy was demonstrated against strains of e. coli and p. aeruginosa (fici = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against s. pseudintermedius strains (fici = 1.25). proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. conclusions and clinical importance: in vitro synergy of polymyxin b and miconazole against e. coli and p. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.
[comparative study of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from burned patients during two periods (2005-2008, 2008-2011) and in two hospitals (hospital aziza othmana, trauma and burn center)].
background: continuous monitoring of the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance of the main bacteria involved in nosocomial infections helps improve treatment and prevention strategies. aim: to compare the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of the main bacterial isolates within the burned patients over two periods of 3 years and in two hospitals. methods: during two three-year periods: period 1 (p1): 1/7/2005-30/6/2008 and period 2 (p2): 1/7/2008-30/6/2011) and in two hospitals: hospital aziza othmana (hao) and the traumatology and burn center (ctgb), 2153 and 3719 non-repetitive strains were isolated from burn patients from different samples. the transfer of the intensive care unit was made on 01/07/2008 from the hospital aziza othmana to ctgb. the study of antibiotic sensitivity was performed according to ca-sfm. results: during the period p1, pseudomonas aeruginosa was the main bacteria isolated (18%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (14%) and acinetobacter baumannii (12%). after the transfer of intensive care burn unit to the traumatology center, ecology bacterial varied with s. aureus (20%) in the first place followed by p. aeruginosa (15%) and proteus mirabilis (11%). the study of the evolution of antibiotic susceptibility showed an overall downward trend of resistance in the second half of 2008, immediately after the transfer of service in the new hospital structure. the rate of ceftazidim resistant klebsilella pneumoniae decreased from 80.4% to 50%, similarly the resistance of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem decreased respectively from 61% to 39.4% and from 63.3% to 37.1%. nevertheless, the reduction of resistance was followed by a rapid increasing during the year 2009 to reach overall rates of resistance previously observed in the hospital aziza othmana. concerning s. aureus, the rate of mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) showed no significant variation throughout the study period: 60% versus 56.3% at hao and ctgb. a. baumannii brings up the problem of mutiresistance: 92.7% of strains were resistant to ceftazidime and 63.9% to imipenem during p1 with an emphasis on resistance to imipenem during p2 increased to 89.3%. conclusion: resistance is a problem in the intensive care burn unit. preventive measures have to be taken.
[antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
we determined mics of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 japanese facilities in 2008. mics were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) accounted for 3.8% of escherichia coli, 2.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of proteus vulgaris. esbl produced strains were 6.8% at k. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at p. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. among haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an mic90 of 1 microg/ml and doripenem showed an mic90 of 4 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa have potent activity. of all p. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. against other glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary infections in taiwan: results from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart), 2006-2010.
we investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance among species of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in taiwan during the period 2006-2010 as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart). during the study period, 1032 isolates of gram-negative bacilli that had been collected from patients with hepatobiliary infections were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (n = 874, 84.7%) of isolates and escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (n = 323, 31.3%). there were significantly more e. coli (p = 0.001) and proteus mirabilis (p = 0.031) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for less than 48 h and significantly more serratia marcescens (p = 0.035) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.008) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for 48 h or longer. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing pathogens was low. the decline in susceptibility rates with time was remarkable for ceftazidime (p = 0.036), ciprofloxacin (p = 0.029), and levofloxacin (p = 0.018). the most effective antibiotics, i.e., those that were active against more than 90% of enterobacteriaceae, were amikacin, cefepime, imipenem, ertapenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to anti-pseudomonal agents was greater than 80%. in this study, we found an overall increase in resistance to antimicrobial agents among gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in taiwan. surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and updates of treatment guidelines are recommended to help achieve optimal therapy for patients with hepatobiliary infections.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.
[antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2006].
we determined mics of antibacterial agents against 1280 clinical strains of aerobic gram-negative bacteria (19 genus or species) isolated at 16 japanese facilities in 2006. mics were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) accounted for 3.7% of escherichia coli, 2.7% of klebsiella spp., and 11.4% of proteus spp. notably, 18.8% of proteus mirabilis was found to produce esbl higher than 16.7% in 2004. this result was higher extremely than other species. among haemophilus influenzae, only 1.2% produced beta-lactamase and 62.8% that increased compared with 57.7% in 2004, were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. although few antibacterial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa have potent activity, only three agents--doripenem, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin-showed an mic90 of 4 microg/ml. of all p aeruginosa strains, 5.7% were resistant to six or more agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, a decrease compared to 8.7% in 2004. against other glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2004.
cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
objective: some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. materials and methods: antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against dna virus herpes simplex type 1 and rna virus parainfluenza (type-3). cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: candida albicans and candida parapsilosis. results: atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. conclusion: antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
synthesis and spectrum of the neoglycoside achn-490.
achn-490 is a neoglycoside, or "next-generation" aminoglycoside (ag), that has been identified as a potentially useful agent to combat drug-resistant bacteria emerging in hospitals and health care facilities around the world. a focused medicinal chemistry campaign produced a collection of over 400 sisomicin analogs from which achn-490 was selected. we tested achn-490 against two panels of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, many of which harbored ag resistance mechanisms. unlike legacy ags, achn-490 was active against strains expressing known ag-modifying enzymes, including the three most common such enzymes found in enterobacteriaceae. achn-490 inhibited the growth of ag-resistant enterobacteriaceae (mic(90), </=4 mug/ml), with the exception of proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (mic(90), 8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively). achn-490 was more active alone in vitro against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates with ag-modifying enzymes than against those with altered permeability/efflux. the mic(90) of achn-490 against ag-resistant staphylococci was 2 mug/ml. due to its promising in vitro and in vivo profiles, achn-490 has been advanced into clinical development as a new antibacterial agent.
[evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of vale do sousa and tamega].
the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
development of an oregano-based ointment with anti-microbial activity including activity against methicillin-resistant staphlococcus aureus.
increasing antibiotic resistance has prompted a search for new compounds with anti-microbial activity. in the authors' previous study, oregano extract was identified as one of the most potent anti-microbial compounds. the disk diffusion method was employed to assess the degree of inhibition against various microorganisms, and the bacteriostatic or bactericidal mechanism of action. disk diffusion studies showed that oregano was found to be bacteriostatic for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, (mrsa) but bacteriocidal for seven other microorganisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa could not be inhibited by oregano. an ointment consisting of 1-10% oregano could inhibit most organisms except for proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris, which required 20% and pseudomonas which could not be inhibited even at the highest concentration of 80%. oregano extracts can be formulated into an ointment that shows broad antimicrobial activity. additional testing to assess tissue toxicity and other adverse reactions would be needed prior to human testing.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of four ficus carica latex fractions against resistant human pathogens (antimicrobial activity of ficus carica latex).
methanolic, hexanoic, chloroformic and ethyl acetate extracts of ficus carica latex were investigated for their in vitro antimicrobial proprieties against five bacteria species and seven strains of fungi. the green fruit latex was collected from chott mariam souse, middle east coast of tunisia. the antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated and based respectively on the inhibition zone using the disc-diffusion assay, minimal inhibition concentration (mic) for bacterial testing and the method by calculating inhibition percentage (i%) for fungi-inhibiting activities. the methanolic extract had no effect against bacteria except for proteus mirabilis while the ethyl acetate extract had inhibition effect on the multiplication of five bacteria species (enterococcus fecalis, citobacter freundei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, echerchia coli and proteus mirabilis). for the opportunist pathogenic yeasts, ethyl acetate and chlorophormic fractions showed a very strong inhibition (100%); methanolic fraction had a total inhibition against candida albicans (100%) at a concentration of 500 microg/ml and a negative effect against cryptococcus neoformans. microsporum canis was strongly inhibited with methanolic extract (75%) and totally with ethyl acetate extract at a concentration of 750 microg/ml. hexanoic extract showed medium results.
changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
a number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two gram-positive strains of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with lc(50) of 5.8 mum and 5.6 mum respectively. however, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-negative strains, such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
some observations on the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
the ability of uropathogens to migrate along external surfaces of silicone foley  catheters was examined. proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most motile organisms. p. aeruginosa migrated over both triclosan-impregnated and nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters, but these antibacterials inhibited the migration of p. mirabilis.
[etiology of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary pathogens].
with the objective of knowing the common etiological agents in urinary infection  and comparing its antimicrobial susceptibility in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we analyse all the urine bacteriological exams from the servico de patologia clinica do centro hospitalar do nordeste, epe - unidade hospitalar de braganca, during a two years period (april 2004 to march 2006). during this period, 4018 urine bacteriological exams were made. the cultural exam was positive in 572 samples (144 from nosocomial infections and 428 from community-acquired urinary infections). the escherichia coli was the more isolated strain (68,4 %), followed by klebsiella spp (7,9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6,1%) and proteus mirabilis (5,2%). concerning to antimicrobial susceptibility, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp showed a high resistance to the antimicrobials amoxicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, ceftazidim and quinolones. for enterobacteriaceae imipenem, amikacin and netilmicin were the antimicrobials with more level of susceptibility. imipenem and amikacin were the more efficient antimicrobials against pseudomonas aeruginosa. concerning to the susceptibility for the same etiological agent, in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we founded statistical significant differences in the antimicrobials ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and collistin for pseudomonas aeruginosa and in the group of antimicrobials from quinolones for the proteus mirabilis. in the other identified agents there were no statistical significant differences for antimicrobials. this study it allows making use of data necessary for the knowledge of etiologic urinary infection agents in braganca and provides the information about the antimicrobials resistance, which were necessary to initiate an adequate empirical treatment and to elaborate treatment guides.
identification of an inhibitor of the murc enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
the pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the mur enzymes. in the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of the escherichia coli murc (udp-n-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase), the first of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. inhibition of atp consumed during the murc reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. after nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, c-1 emerged as a compound for further characterization. the inhibition of murc by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. c-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the e. coli murc reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of atp binding to the murc enzyme. further work with murc enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting murc from genera (proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to e. coli, murc enzymes from more distant gram-negative species such as haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baylyi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
in vitro activities of doripenem and six comparator drugs against 423 aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates from infected diabetic foot wounds.
against 182 anaerobe and 241 aerobe strains obtained from diabetic foot infections, doripenem was the most active carbapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90), 2 microg/ml), more active than imipenem against proteus mirabilis, and ertapenem was more active against escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. the mic(50) and mic(90) values were < or =0.125 microg/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and all streptococci and 0.25/1 for bacteroides fragilis.
in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004).
the spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11723 strains) of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial ssti in >70 medical centers participating in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in north america (37.4%), europe (26.7%), latin america (16.7%), and the asia-pacific region (19.2%). all isolates were tested using the reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for ssti. ranking pathogens producing ssti during these years included staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), escherichia coli (9.0%), enterococcus spp. (7.3%), klebsiella spp. (4.8%), enterobacter spp. (4.7%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against s. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (mic(50), 0.06 mg/l) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (mic(50), 0.25 mg/l). furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against e. coli, klebsiella spp., and acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against p. aeruginosa. in summary, garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key gram-positive pathogens (s. aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents against other species (enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.). these in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in ssti, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens.
antibacterial activities of emblica officinalis and coriandrum sativum against gram negative urinary pathogens.
present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of emblica officinalis (amla) and coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. aqueous infusion and decoction of emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (270), klebsiella pneumoniae (51), k. ozaenae (3), proteus mirabilis (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), salmonella typhi (1), s. paratyphi a (2), s. paratyphi b (1) and serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against gram negative urinary pathogens.
antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of anthocephalus cadamba.
anthocephalus cadamba (roxb.) miq. syn a. chinensis (lamk) a. rich (rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western ghats for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobial potential of a. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. the alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus and aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that a. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that a. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.

the bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2004 and july 2005. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. the strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). against staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (abk), vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc) and vcm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (czop) and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or = 4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, czop, meropenem (mepm), and carumonam (crmn) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. against serratia marcescens, imipenem (ipm) and gentamicin (gm) had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. mepm prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/ml. next, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), czop, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/ml except ipm and mepm having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activities of czop and caz were considered to be relatively good on mic50 comparison (mic50: 2 microg/ml).
antibacterial and antioxidant activities in sideritis italica (miller) greuter et burdet essential oils.
sideritis italica (miller) greuter et burdet is a widespread lamiacea in the mediterranean region used in traditional medicine. essential oils were antibacterial against nine atcc and as many clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. antibacterial activity was also found against helicobacter pylori: a dose-dependant inhibition was shown between 5 and 25 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of the oils was expressed as mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations) and mbcs (minimum bactericidal concentrations). at a concentration between 3.9 and 250 microg/ml the oils showed a significant antibacterial effect against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in particular the atcc strains pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=3.9 microg/ml and 7.8 for flowerheads and leaves, respectively), proteus mirabilis (mic=15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml), salmonella typhi (mic=7.8 microg/ml) and proteus vulgaris (mic=15.6 microg/ml) were the most inhibited. only pseudomonas aeruginosa showed mbc at a concentration between 62.6 and 125 microg/ml. the antioxidant activity of the essential oils was evaluated by two cell free colorimetric methods: abts and dmpd; leaf oil is more active (4.29 +/- 0.02 trolox equivalents and 4.53 +/- 0.67 ascorbic acid equivalents by abts and dmpd, respectively). finally the antioxidant activity of the essential oils was also evaluated by their effects on human whole blood leukocytes (wb) and on isolated polymorphonucleate (pmn) chemiluminescence. comparing the effects of the oils from leaves and flowerheads on both pmn and wb chemiluminescence emission, we found no significant differences. essential oils showed a dose-dependent and linear inhibitory activity on isolated pmn as well as on wb cl emission when pma-stimulated. on the contrary, the inhibitory activity on resting cells was nonlinear. our data represent an answer to the continual demand for new antibiotics and antioxidants for the continuous emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the growing interest in the substitution of synthetic antioxidants with natural ones. furthermore, our finding of antibacterial and antioxidant activities in the essential oils from sideritis italica flowerheads and leaves validated the use of the plant for medical purposes.

isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. the brine shrimp bioassay indicated schiff's bases, l3 and l6 and, their cu (ii) and ni (ii) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (ld50 > 1000).
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2003 and july 2004. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. the strains consisted of 258 gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (abpc), cefozopran (czop), imipenem (ipm), and clarithromycin (cam) showed a strong activity and the mic90 was 0.125 microg/ml or less. against enterococcus faecalis, vcm, abpc, and ipm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially czop and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or =4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (mepm) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of crmn and czop was good. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. against serratia marcescens, mepm had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, mepm and crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. nest, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cpr, czop, and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/ml except ipm and amikacin (amk) having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was relatively good (mic50: 2 microg/ml).
in vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. this question led us to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli were used for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin hcl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. drops were placed on whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto mueller-hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. after overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees c, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. there was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. the inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to department of dermatology,  poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. the percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the european population is about 1%-2%. the aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. in 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and escherichia coli (12.57%). there was a significant increase in the incidence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. the rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
antibacterial and antioxidant activities of ethanol extract from paullinia cupana mart.
the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the ethanol extract from paullinia  cupana var. sorbilis mart. (sapindaceae) seeds, commonly called guarana, was assessed towards selected bacteria as well as in different antioxidant models. the extract, at a concentration between 16 and 128 microg/ml, showed a significant antibacterial effect expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in particular, pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=16 microg/ml), proteus mirabilis (mic=32 microg/ml), proteus vulgaris (mic=32 microg/ml) and escherichia coli (mic=32 microg/ml) were the most inhibited. the antioxidant activity was determined by the malonyldialdehyde (mda) test, measuring the mda concentration in 3t3-l1 cells after induced cellular damage using ferric ammonium citrate (fac). the reduction of lipid peroxidation was 62.5% using a guarana extract with a concentration of 2 microg/ml. this effect was dose/dependent. the ethanol extract from paullinia cupana seeds was analysed by spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of catechol substances after treatment of the extract with p-aminophenol. the total phenolics content in the ethanol extract was also determined spectrophotometrically according to the folin-ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (gae). the concentration of catechol equivalent was 6.06+/-0.13 mg/g (mean+/-s.d.), while the total phenolic content was 8.43+/-0.21 mg/g (mean+/-s.d.). the correlation index between antioxidant activity and catechol content was 0.96.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and shigella dysentriae) and four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureous and streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed schiffs' bases. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 13 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2002 and july 2003. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. the number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/ml. the susceptibility of staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (ctm) was relatively good. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc), imipenem (ipm), and vcm showed the strongest antibacterial activity (mic90: 2-4 microg/ml). in addition, the low sensitive strains (mic: > or = 256 microg/ml) to clarithromycin (cam) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (czop). the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially czop and cefpirome (cpr) showed the highest activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. the antibacterial activity of cephems to citrobacter freundii was generally low but czop and cpr had a strong acitivity (mic90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the antibacterial activity of cephems to klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (cmx), cefixime (cfix), flomoxef (fmox), cpr, and czop showed stronger activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). against serratia marcescens, meropenem (mepm) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by cpr and czop. against proteus mirabilis, cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cpr, mepm, carumonam (crmn), and levofloxacin (lvfx) showed the strongest activity (mc90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). among other cephems, czop and cfix were also strong (mic90: 0.25 microg/ml). the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/ml except ipm and amikacin (amk) having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was relatively good (mic50: 8 microg/ml).
results from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme: report of the 2001 data from 15 united states medical centres.
the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is an international surveillance network of more than 100 medical centres where meropenem is the primary therapeutic carbapenem. institutions have been monitored since 1997 (1999 in united states (us)) using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) reference susceptibility methods to monitor in vitro activity of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. in 2001, a total of 2874 strains were processed from the 15 us medical centres. molecular methods were associated with mic methods as needed for defining epidemic spread of resistant strains. the meropenem mic(90) values were 0.03 mg/l for citrobacter spp., escherichia coli and klebsiella spp.; 0.06 mg/l for proteus mirabilis and serratia spp. and 0.12 mg/l for enterobacter spp. this potency was 8-16-fold greater than that of imipenem and the meropenem spectrum of activity versus the enterobacteriaceae was the broadest of all tested antimicrobial agents. only piperacillin/tazobactam (mic(9), 64 mg/l) and tobramycin (mic(90), 4 mg/l) were active against more than 90.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa at the nccls susceptible breakpoint, and the carbapenems were the most active compounds against acinetobacter spp. however, acinetobacter spp. isolates were resistant to all of the antimicrobial agents tested and the molecular typing results suggested that they were epidemiologically related. only ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime had significantly reduced activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (87.9-92.6% susceptible. these 2001 us mystic programme results demonstrated no significant decline in carbapenem activity or susceptibility rates compared with the previously monitored years (1999-2000). most apparent were the decreasing susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime against staphylococci. continued surveillance in these institutions appears warranted as sites of high potential emerging resistance risk.
relationship between fluoroquinolone use and changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones of selected pathogens in 10 united states teaching hospitals, 1991-2000.
we retrospectively examined the relationship between fluoroquinolone use and the  susceptibilities of 11 bacterial pathogens to fluoroquinolones in 10 us teaching hospitals from 1991 through 2000. statistical significance was determined by 2-way analysis of variance, with the number of isolates tested each year as a weighting factor. the analysis of baseline-to-end point change in the percentage of susceptibility and the slope of the regression line (trend line) for logit percentage of susceptibility showed that the overall percentage of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones decreased significantly during the study period (p<.05) and that change in percentage of susceptibility was significantly related to change in fluoroquinolone use (p<.05). particularly notable were the decreases in the susceptibilities of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli (decreases of 25.1%, 11.9%, and 6.8%, respectively).
argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
the in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period november 2001-march 2002. out of 418 enterobacteriaceae included in the study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. esbls putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of proteus mirabilis and 25% escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as esbls producers notably p.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for esbl producers. esbls producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. the isolates considered as amp c beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. noteworthy only 4% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mic(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against acinetobacter spp (mic(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). only 41.7% acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of haemophilus influenzae isolates (mic(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as e.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 e.faecium and 1 e.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. all the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed mics of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (mic(90) 4 microg/ml).piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (ie: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in argentina. caution must be taken for infections due to esbl producers considering that the inoculum effect mics can affect mic values.
antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1h-benzimidazoles and their feiii, cuii, znii, and agi complexes.
2-(2-pyridinyl)- (li), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (lii), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(liii), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (liv), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1h-benzimidazoles (lv) and their complexes with fe(no3)3, cu(no3)2, zn(no3)2, and agno3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans. the methyl groups of liii increase the antimicrobial activity. the agi complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. some znii complexes show an antimicrobial effect against s. aureus and s. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. cuii complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to s. aureus and s. epidermidis.
in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
effects of mupirocin at subinhibitory concentrations on flagella formation in pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis.
colonization of pseudomonas aeruginosa at trachea, nares and oropharynx can cause ventilator-acquired pneumonia. to identify beneficial effects of antibiotics on expression of virulence factors related to colonization by such pathogens, we evaluated the effect of mupirocin on flagella formation in p. aeruginosa and on motility and flagella formation in proteus mirabilis. in p. aeruginosa, subinhibitory concentrations of mupirocin inhibited flagella formation, which was associated with reduced flagellin expression. in p. mirabilis, subinhibitory concentrations of mupirocin dose-dependently suppressed bacterial motility and flagella formation, again with reduced flagellin expression. our results indicate that subinhibitory concentrations of mupirocin can suppress expression of virulence factors in p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis.
urinary tract infection trends in latin american hospitals: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. the objective of this study was to report the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens collected in latin america between 1997 to 2000 through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. in the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. the patients' mean age was 51.3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65.6%). esherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated followed by klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis. among the e. coli isolates, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic options for treatment of serious uti in latin america (91.0-100.0% susceptible). high resistance rates to fluoroquinolones (17.5-18.9%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (>45.0%) were observed among the e. coli. in contrast, nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility rate of > 87.0%. against klebsiella spp. infections, the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (>30.0%) producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). even the new fluoroquinolones showed limited activity against klebsiella spp. (72.1-88.6% susceptible) and the p. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents tested. the results of this survey endorse the importance of enterobacteriaceae as cause of uti in latin america. our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the latin american medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, esbl-producing k. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region.
modification of dienes mutual inhibition test for epidemiological characterization of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important cause of community-associated and nosocomial infections related to exposure to aqueous environments. such infections often occur in the setting of a common-source outbreak, in which case epidemiological characterization of isolates may be necessary. in this preliminary study, a modification of the dienes mutual inhibition test, ordinarily used to assess the relatedness of swarming proteus mirabilis strains, was used to study 15 p. aeruginosa isolates, with the results compared to those obtained by ribotype analysis. complete concordance was noted between the results of the dienes test and those of ribotyping. these observations suggest that further studies are warranted to assess the utility of the modified dienes test as a simple, inexpensive, and reliable means for epidemiological typing of p. aeruginosa.
[in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (pzfx mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) the mic50 and mic90 values of pzfx against clinically isolated gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. pzfx showed broad spectrum activity. the antibacterial activities of pzfx against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (ipm/cs)-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (caz), ceftriaxone, ipm/cs, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) pzfx showed superior bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa to those of caz and ipm/cs after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) caz and ipm/cs had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of mic against p. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while pzfx exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) pzfx inhibited both dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv from s. aureus at nearly the same level. pzfx showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase ii from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) pzfx mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of caz with following infection model caused by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, cmc pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) intravenous administration of pzfx with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.
synthesis of mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
5-phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. the structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (ir, 1h-nmr, eims) methods. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/ml respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against s. flexneri (mic: both 312.5 micrograms/ml). the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.
characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
[a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
[antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.
in vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a spanish multicenter study.
the in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. according to the nccls breakpoints, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. more than 90.0% of the escherichia coli and citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. in general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (utis) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated utis. more than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from utis, except for p. aeruginosa (31.8%) and acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. the results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated utis.
changing trends in frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens in outpatient clinics and a hospital in southern israel, 1991-1995.
in order to monitor changes in the frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens over several years, urinary cultures received from outpatient clinics and from a hospital during a period of one month each in 1991 and 1995 were analyzed at a clinical microbiology laboratory. in 1991 and 1995, 1366 and 1534 significant monomicrobic cultures respectively were reviewed. the frequency of escherichia coli dropped significantly in the outpatient clinics from 70.5% to 61.2% (p < 0.0001). the frequency of proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria also decreased, but the frequency of klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. increased from 2.6% to 5.8% (p < 0.0001). in the hospital, the frequency of enterobacter spp. (p < 0.04), escherichia coli and morganella morganii declined from 1991 to 1995, whereas the frequency of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), acinetobacter spp. (p < 0.05), klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative rods increased considerably. the frequency of gram-positive aerobic bacteria rose markedly in outpatient specimens from 6.1% to 13.5% (p < 0.0001), while a decline from 14.4% to 9.3% was noted in hospital specimens (p < 0.02). a significant rise in the resistance of escherichia coli to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) was detected in outpatient isolates. in the hospital, gram-negative urinary pathogens demonstrated increased resistance to ampicillin (p = 0.042), cefuroxime (p = 0.005), gentamicin (p = 0.002) and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) during the study period. the changing etiology of urinary tract infections and the increasing resistance of organisms indicate that periodic monitoring and possibly also modification of empirical therapy are required.
multicenter laboratory evaluation of the biomerieux vitek antimicrobial susceptibility testing system with 11 antimicrobial agents versus members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
a four-center study in which a total of 1,082 recent clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined versus 11 antimicrobial agents with the biomerieux vitek susceptibility test system (hazelwood, mo.) and the gns-f6 card was conducted. in addition, a challenge set consisting of the same 200 organisms was examined in each of the four participating laboratories. results obtained with the vitek system were compared to mics determined by a standardized broth microdilution method. for purposes of comparison, susceptibility categories (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) were assigned on the basis of the results of both methods. the result of the broth microdilution test was considered definitive. the total category error rate with the vitek system and the recent clinical isolates (11,902 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 4.5%, i.e., 1.7% very major errors, 0.9% major errors, and 1.9% minor errors. the total category error rate calculated from tests performed with the challenge set (i.e., 8,800 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 5.9%, i.e., 2.2% very major errors, 1.1% major errors, and 2.6% minor errors. very major error rates higher than the totals were noted with enterobacter cloacae versus ampicillin-sulbactam, aztreonam, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate and with p. aeruginosa versus mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. major error rates higher than the averages were observed with proteus mirabilis versus imipenem and with klebsiella pneumoniae versus ofloxacin. excellent overall interlaboratory reproducibility was observed with the vitek system. the importance of inoculum size as a primary determinant in the accuracy of susceptibility test results with the vitek system was clearly demonstrated in this study. specifically, when an inoculum density fourfold higher than that recommended by the manufacturer was used, high rates of false resistance results were obtained with cell wall-active antimicrobial agents versus both the enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

etiology and therapy of chronic suppurative otitis.
infectious diseases of the ear are important in adults due to their incidence and relapses. we carried out a study of aerobic microorganisms on 251 otic exudates from patients diagnosed as having chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma (119), chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma (85) and chronic external otitis (47). the microorganisms predominantly isolated were, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and other enterobacteriaceae. 86% of isolates were monomicrobial and 14% of isolates were polymicrobial. in these latter the predominantly isolated microorganisms were also p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, corynebacterium spp. and proteus mirabilis. p. aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated and showed the highest percentages of resistance against antimicrobial agents tested. p. aeruginosa was most susceptible to ciprofloxacin and imipenem, but much less susceptible to cefotaxime, moxalactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. s. aureus was highly sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin and teichoplanin. 100% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin g and ampicillin.

inhibitory action of metabolites of pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.
efficacy of a novel injectable cephalosporin, cefclidin, on the experimental complicated urinary tract infections with urinary stones caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis.
we evaluated the effects of a novel cephalosporin, cefclidin (cfcl) and imipenem  (ipm), on the eradication of bacteria from the urine, bladder stones and the kidneys, and also on the prevention of the infection stone formations, in our polymicrobial urinary tract infection model of rats associated with bladder stones using imp-sensitive or ipm-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis as a causative pathogen. cfcl completely eradicated p. mirabilis from the urine and the stone in the short-term regimen (5 days). cfcl completely eradicated both ipm-sensitive p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis from the urine, the stones and the kidneys as compared to ipm in the long-term regimen (11 days), reflecting the superior antibacterial activity of cfcl. cfcl also significantly prevented the development of infection stones as compared to ipm in the long-term regimen. there was no significant difference in the blood urea nitrogen (bun) values between the cfcl or ipm-treated and the non-treated groups. the cumulative recovery rate of unchanged cfcl reached 47.3% of the total dosage (20 mg/kg) within 8 hours.
bactericidal properties of crude extracts of mitracarpus villosus.
mature leaves and inflorescence of mitracarpus villosus, collected from niger state, nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. the crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. the extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. the ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
antimicrobial effect of combinations of edta-tris and amikacin or neomycin on the microorganisms associated with otitis externa in dogs.
combinations of edta-tris and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin and neomycin) were tested for synergistic activities against the microorganisms associated with otitis externa in dogs and for the solutions' stability over time. synergistic activity was observed when edta-tris plus amikacin and edta-tris plus neomycin were tested against staphylococcus intermedius, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli, but not against candida albicans. stability studies over a 3-month period indicated that the test solutions were stable at room temperature and that their antimicrobial activity was maintained.
in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[in vitro antibacterial activity of isoxazolyl++ naphthoquinones. i].
the in vitro antibacterial activity of 2-hydroxy-n-(3,4-dimethyl-5-isoxazolyl) 1,4 naphthoquinone-4-imine (i) and three of this derivatives against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis y morganella morganii was investigated. from the four naphthoquinone-imine studied, compound i exhibited activity against s. aureus. this effect was observed even in oxygen atmosphere with 5% co2 and in the presence of human albumin. the development of drug-resistant strains by serial passage in media with concentrations lower than the c.i.m. was determined in 31 strains of s. aureus from clinical material and one from collection. no significant differences in c.i.m. were observed.
comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
effect of a human igg preparation rich in antibodies to a wide range of lipopolysaccharides on gram-negative bacterial sepsis in burned mice.
a human intravenous igg preparation (anti-lps igg) rich in antibodies to different lipopolysaccharides (lps) and a normal human intravenous igg (nigg) were investigated for their ability to confer passive immunity. both preparations were given at the time of infection (prophylaxis) or during sepsis (therapy) to burned mice with lethal infection induced by various clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. when given at the time of infection both igg preparations (5 mg/mouse) inhibited lethality induced by some bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup g and b), but not others (serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis), indicating a protection by by strain-specific antibodies. however, no significant protection was seen when mice were treated during sepsis. the range of specific antibody titers to the whole live bacteria and heat-killed (lps-preserved) bacteria in the nigg paralleled that of anti-lps igg; however, the magnitude of the antibody titers did not accurately reflect the protective capacity in vivo. thus, the exact specificity of the protective antibodies is still unknown. the protective effect of both igg preparations was dose-dependent; at low igg doses (0.5 mg/mouse) better protection was obtained with anti-lps igg, whilst at higher doses (> or = 1 mg/mouse) both preparations exhibited identical effects. low doses of either igg preparation in combination with subtherapeutic doses of piperacillin significantly enhanced early survival (day 2 for nigg and day 2 + 3 for anti-lps igg) against p. aeruginosa, but the protective effect waned thereafter. we conclude that a strain-specific antibacterial effect in a compromised mouse infection model can be obtained by early passive immunization with human igg from large plasma pools. it is suggested that anti-lps igg or nigg may be of benefit in some cases of gram-negative sepsis when administered as prophylaxis together with proper antibiotic treatment.
[antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
effects of cefaclor, cefetamet and ro 40-6890 on inflammatory responses of human  granulocytes.
the effect of three cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefaclor and ro 40-6890) upon human granulocytes and their ability to modulate the chemiluminescence response, phagocytose, kill bacteria and generate leukotrienes was studied. in the presence of the cephalosporins there was a significant increase in phagocytosis of escherichia coli. the bactericidal activity of human granulocytes for several other bacteria was also enhanced. cefetamet and cefaclor increased the chemiluminescence response of human neutrophils to pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis in contrast to ro 40-68790, which decreased the chemiluminescence response. the cephalosporins decreased the synthesis of leukotrienes from human neutrophils after stimulation with escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. these data emphasize the immunomodulatory functions of various cephalosporins on cells involved in host defence.
in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.
inhibition of motility of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis by subinhibitory concentrations of azithromycin.
exposure to subinhibitory concentrations (4-8 micrograms/ml) of azithromycin resulted in loss of motility in proteus mirabilis strains and a significant reduction of motility in pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. examination revealed that the loss of motility was due to a total absence of flagella in proteus mirabilis while the poor motility observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa was due to absence of flagella in the majority of the population. since motility may be considered a pathogenicity trait in the two species, these results confirm the unusual ability of azithromycin to reduce the expression of virulence factors in gram-negative pathogens.
antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
in vitro activity of ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.

ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
[studies on the sub-mic of beta-lactam antibiotics--bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum].
bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum i.e. patients with cancer, the  elderly, diabetes, was stronger than that in normal serum against proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) but was weaker against klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae). against escherichia coli (e. coli), bactericidal activity on serum of patients with cancer was weaker in the following order, that in elderly serum, that in diabetic serum. against proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris), bactericidal activity in elderly serum was similar to that in normal serum but was stronger than that in serum of patients with cancer. against pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), bactericidal activity in elderly serum and diabetic serum was similar to that in normal serum but was weaker than that in serum of patients with cancer. piperacillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, normal serum and compromised host's serum at a concentration of 1/4 mic against e. coli, p. mirabilis and p. aeruginosa. aspoxicillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, and bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity in normal serum and serum of patients with cancer against e. coli and p. aeruginosa. while cefazolin and cefmetazole slightly inhibited the growth of bacteria in nutrient broth, they showed hardly any bactericidal activity in normal serum and compromised host's serum.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
[in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).
in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.
comparative in vitro activity of sm7338, a new carbapenem antimicrobial agent.
the comparative in vitro activity of sm7338 was tested against 670 routine clinical isolates and 130 cefoperazone-resistant isolates of bacteria by agar dilution methods. sm7338 was at least as active as imipenem against gram-negative organisms but was slightly less active against gram-positive organisms. sm7338 was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics for 90% of strains of less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for all species tested. differences in activity between sm7338 and imipenem were particularly striking against proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii, against which mics of sm7338 and imipenem for 90% of strains were 0.125 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the presence of unique plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21 transconjugants did not affect activity substantially, except in the case of oxa-2 (eightfold-increased mic) and oxa-3 (fourfold-increased mic). sm7338 was also active against a laboratory-derived strain of p. aeruginosa which hyperproduced chromosomal beta-lactamase, inhibiting both the wild type and the mutant at a concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml.
in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
[in vitro antibacterial activity of apalcillin on aerobic bacteria and the regression curve].
minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of apalcillin (apl) were evaluated by agar dilution on 1,201 bacterial strains isolated simultaneously in four university hospitals; agar diffusion tests (disks apl: 75 micrograms) were performed on these strains to establish relationship between mic and zone diameters. for enterobacteriaceae naturally non beta-lactamase-producing (e. coli and p. mirabilis), mode mic was 0.5 microgram/ml; some acquired penicillinase-producing strains were only inhibited by concentrations greater than or equal to 16. chromosomal penicillinase producing klebsiella were inhibited by 2 to 8 micrograms/ml but apl was inactive on acquired penicillinase-producing strains. for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species (enterobacter, citrobacter, serratia, indole + proteus and providencia) two populations of strains were observed: one sensitive and the second resistant to carboxypenicillins: on the first population, mode mic of apl was 1 to 4 micrograms/ml; on the second mic were generally greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml. p. aeruginosa strains sensitive to carboxypenicillins were inhibited by 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; this activity was diminished on strains resistant to these antibiotics (mic apl 8-32). mic of acinetobacter varied to 0.25 to greater than 128 with a majority of strains inhibited by 4 to 64 micrograms/ml. apl was active against non penicillinase producing staphylococci; mode mic was 2 micrograms/ml for enterococci. correlation coefficient of regression curve was 0.87. for critical concentrations less than or equal to 8 and greater than 64 micrograms/ml, critical diameters could be greater than or equal to 19 and less than 12 mm.
activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
the in vitro antibacterial activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. e-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. e-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. in general, e-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics giving 90% inhibition for e-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the activity of e-3846 increased at acid ph; in contrast, acid ph caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. in vivo, e-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental s. faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
[susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
[antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. comparison with other new cephems].
antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of cpz, cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx) and latamoxef (lmox). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of sbt and cpz mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by the dilution method using mueller-hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of cpz. antimicrobial activities of sbt/cpz against principally penicillinase (pcase) producing bacteria, i.e., s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, were superior to those of cpz alone. the presence of sbt in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced cpz's antimicrobial activities against these pcase producing strains. the synergistic antimicrobial effects of sbt in combination with cpz were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (cepase) producing bacteria, i.e., c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris, and p. aeruginosa, and exerted with sbt at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by mic80's of tested agents showed that sbt/cpz had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria than ctm, ctx and lmox. mic's of sbt/cpz were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of s. aureus, 18% of c. freundii, 10% of enterobacter spp., 26% of s. marcescens, 2% of p. vulgaris, and 18% of p. aeruginosa. these resistant strains against which the addition of sbt showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. it is concluded that the presence of cpz resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from cpz is increasing. when these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of sbt/cpz in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.
[urinary tract infections in children. status in a pediatric hospital and sensitivity of bacterial strains to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid combination].
three hundred bacterial strains from positive urine cultures were isolated over a 10 months period in paediatric hospitalized and out-patients. in addition to commonly used antibiotics, each strain was tested for amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin, beecham) susceptibility. this antibiotic, which is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta lactamases, may be of interest in the treatment of urinary tract infections because of its pharmacokinetics and activity. the antibacterial activity of amoxycillin and augmentin against enterobacteriaceae with special reference to escherichia coli was compared. the resistance phenotype of enterobacteriaceae to amoxycillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin allows to anticipate the nature of the beta-lactamase produced by a particular strain, and infer the activity of augmentin. the overall activity of augmentin should be interpreted taking into account the resistance phenotypes. in our study, augmentin was active against 90% of e. coli strains, almost all proteus mirabilis and vulgaris strains but 9 out of 24 klebsiella strains were resistant. augmentin had no activity against nosocomial enterobacteriaceae, nor against pseudomonas aeruginosa. on the other hand, its activity was of interest against penicillinase producing staphylococcus. our results confirm the interest of augmentin as a preferential treatment of urinary tract infections in children.
characterization of a protein from normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with bactericidal activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
purification of a bactericidal protein (bp) from the cytoplasmic granules of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) with activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. bactericidal activity from acid extracts of a mixed granule population was purified 175-fold by a two-step chromatographic procedure. the first step, dye-ligand affinity chromatography with matrex-gel orange a, was followed by cation-exchange chromatography with bio-rex 70 resin, and this combination routinely gave a yield near 80%. only one peak of bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa type i was found after each chromatographic step. characterization of bp showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified bp was most active against the six strains of p. aeruginosa tested and against escherichia coli b (a deep rough mutant). purified bp killed 5 x 10(6) cfu of p. aeruginosa type i per ml at a concentration of 60 to 80 ng/ml. proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus were both resistant to the bactericidal activity of bp. bp was shown to be glycosylated by periodic acid staining after gel electrophoresis and to have an isoelectric point near 7.5 by chromatofocusing. the amino acid composition of bp is presented.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2), p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sk&f 88070 compared with other agents.
the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of sk&f 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1h-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. sk&f 88070 inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, morganella morganii, and citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. it was less active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against staphylococcus aureus. sk&f 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. enterobacter species, citrobacter freundii, and serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to sk&f 88070. it was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. sk&f 88070 inhibited richmond-sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
antibacterial activity of amifloxacin (win 49, 375), a new quinolone agent.
the in vitro activity of amifloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial agent was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, aeromonas, salmonella, shigella, citrobacter, enterobacter species, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. amifloxacin inhibited branhamella, haemophilus, and neisseria at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, and 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin- and carbenicillin-resistant isolates, at 4 micrograms/ml. it also inhibited staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but was less active against streptococci and bacteroides species. amifloxacin had in vitro activity similar to enoxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin, but was less active than ciprofloxacin. like other quinolones, it was less active at acid ph and in the presence of urine.
in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
[comparative studies of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1983). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of antibiotics against causative pathogens  isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (uti) in the 8 institutions in japan during the period from 1980 to 1983 were compared. a number of new beta-lactam antibiotics with broad spectrum of activity have become available for clinical use in recent years. some of them, in particular so-called third generation cephems, are reported to be responsible for developing microbial-cross resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. we have been making survey in recent years to explore changes in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents of clinical isolates. all bacterial isolates from clinical specimens were submitted to the department of clinical pathology, juntendo university school of medicine, where they were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with mic 2000 apparatus. of all pathogens from patients with simple uti, the majority of the isolates was e. coli and klebsiella spp. in cases of complicated uti, on the other hand, pseudomonas spp. were most frequent, followed in order by proteus spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp., citrobacter spp. and e. coli. conspicuous changes in antimicrobial activity of antibiotics against e. coli and klebsiella spp. from simple uti have not been found in our survey. against strains of citrobacter spp., even the third generation cephems proved to be not remarkably active and there was a significant decrease in susceptibility of isolates to the drugs test-showed mic values of 50 micrograms/ml and the proportion increased to 50% (22/44) with isolates obtained in 1982. the antimicrobial activity of cefsulodin and gentamicin against p. aeruginosa was decreased in 1982 compared with that in 1980 and 1981. however, resistant strains were slightly more frequent with gentamicin. in 1983, the antimicrobial activity of third generation cephems against serratia spp. was significantly reduced from that in 1982.
in vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. on the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall mic90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin b against klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin b against pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against staphylococcus aureus, (mic90 = 2 mg/l in each case). along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (mic90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against moraxella species. compared to erythromycin (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (mic90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. these results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
[sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the pitie-salpetriere hospital in 1982 and 1983].
susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s. aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e. coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml. haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
the turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 klett-summerson colorimeter units. the suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees c. turbidities for proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. a comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of aztreoman (sq 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam inhibited 90% of citrobacter diversus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris and salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. this activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and shigella species. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. there was no major difference between mbc and mic values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon mic values was observed at 10(7) cfu.
effect of estrogen-promoted bacterial infections of the rat uterus on bioassay of mammalian cell growth factor activities in uterine luminal fluid.
exogenous estradiol treatment of intact or ovariectomized rats causes accumulation of significant volumes of fluid in the uterine horns. in this report, evidence is presented showing the presence of mammalian cell growth factor(s) in uterine luminal fluid (ulf), along with other data showing that the exogenous estradiol treatment needed to cause significant accumulation of the fluid also facilitates the movement of vaginal origin bacteria into the uterine horns. it is shown that microorganisms infect the uteri of 80% or more of rats administered exogenous estradiol, and that the microorganisms are most probably of vaginal origin; procedures such as ligation of the uterine body above the cervix or antibiotic treatment did not suppress the infections. administration of different doses of exogenous estrogen by either implantation of a single 25-mg estradiol/cholesterol pellet which causes a 20- to 50-fold elevation of estradiol levels above physiological plasma concentrations, or instead, by a silastic tube delivery method that elevates levels only 2- to 3-fold above the normal range, resulted in equal frequency of uterine infections and in the appearance of infection at the same time after starting treatment. a number of bacterial species are present in the contaminated ulf, and these are the origins of intracellular products which are potent inhibitors of mammalian cell growth; the presence of these bacterial origin inhibitors interferes with the bioassay of the ulf growth factor activity, and hence, impedes the characterization of the growth factor(s) present in luminal fluid. characterization of the origins of the growth-inhibiting activities showed that pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis are the predominant species present in infected uteri and that both produce exotoxin activities which inhibit growth of mammalian cells in culture; pseudomonas appears to be the greater producer of cytotoxic activity. evidence is presented that suggests that the well-known exotoxin a produced by pseudomonas may be responsible, in part, for the toxic effects of this organism. other, as yet unidentified, cell growth inhibitors also may be produced by the bacteria found in ulf. surgical separation of the uterine body from the cervix allows preparation of ulf which contains no bacteria and substantially reduced levels of growth inhibitors to mammalian cell lines.
susceptibility of blood isolates to various antibiotics, in particular to cephalosporins.
of 760 bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of acutely ill patients in a general hospital in hong kong for 1 year, 69.9% of the isolates were gram-negative aerobes mainly escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.0% were gram-positive aerobes mainly staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and 8.1% were anaerobes mainly bacteroides spp. the susceptibility of the aerobic isolates to various antibiotics was tested. ampicillin was found to be active mainly against the enterococci and some other gram-positive organisms while most isolates of staph. aureus and the gram-negative bacteria were resistant. in contrast, cephalothin was found only slightly less active than the second generation cephalosporins against gram-negative blood isolates but considerably more active against staph. aureus and other gram-positive isolates. the three aminoglycosides tested, i.e., gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, showed similar good activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, but amikacin had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting most of the other gram-negative isolates as well as isolates of staph. aureus. the third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, latamoxef (moxalactam), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, all had a high activity against the gram-negative but a reduced activity against the gram-positive bacteria. ceftazidime had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting all the gram-negative isolates including pseudomonas aeruginosa, while cefotaxime showed the best overall activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative blood isolates.
new broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. iii. synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
the influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (iii) was investigated. introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (iiif--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against proteus mirabilis. displacement of the acetoxy group of iiib with pyridines (iiim--p) enhanced the activity against p. aeruginosa and e. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin iiid having a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. as a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code no. sm-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
[basic and clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
basic and clinical studies were made on cefmenoxime (cmx) in pediatric field, and the following results were obtained. 1. the antibacterial activity of cmx against clinically isolated and maintained strains was examined. cmx had stronger antibacterial activity than cez against escherichia coli, salmonella, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but cez had stronger antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus. 2. the blood concentrations of cmx, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a one-shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of cmx were 33.6, 15.1, 4.5, 2.5 and 0.6 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-life of 1.04 hours. 3. the blood concentrations of cmx, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg of cmx were 32.0, 55.2, 8.4, 4.2 and 1.0 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-lite of 0.96 hour. 4. a complete or partial clinical response to therapy with cmx was obtained in all 10 children with infectious diseases. 5. bacteriological examination made on 3 patients showed that all bacteria had been eradicated, and that therapy was effective. the bacteria were e. coli in 2 patients and proteus mirabilis in 1 patient. 6. the side effects produced were neutropenia, eosinophilia and skin eruption in 1 patient, and diarrhea in 1 patient.
in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ro 13-9904 against 245 clinical isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. the activity of ro 13-9904 against most enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of cefotaxime; it was slightly more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, providencia species, and serratia marcescens, but slightly less active against klebsiella species. ro 13-9904 was twofold more active than cefotaxime and threefold more active than ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean mic of 7.2 micrograms/ml; isolates highly resistant to ticarcillin were inhibited by a mean mic of 17.2 micrograms/ml. ro 13-9904 was fourfold more active than ampicillin against susceptible haemophilus influenzae and was equally active against beta-lactamase-producing isolates. ro 13-9904 was highly active against pneumococci and moderately active (mic, 4 micrograms/ml) against staphylococcus aureus isolates, whether they were susceptible or resistant to penicillin g. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus and streptococcus faecalis were completely resistant to ro 13-9904 (mic, greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
in vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: ly-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
the comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics ly-127935 (ly), cefotaxime (ctx) and cefoperazone (cfp) was examined. ly, ctx and cfp had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis while cfp was less inhibitory than ly or ctx against klebsiella spp.; indole + proteus and gentamicin (gm)-susceptible serratia. ly and ctx were effective while cfp was inactive against enterobacter spp. and gm-resistant serratia. cfp was more active than ly or ctx against gm-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against gm-resistant isolates. bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to ly than ctx or cfp. combination studies against p. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-gm pairs demonstrated synergy.
antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
the chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2h-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. the in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or serratia marcescens. its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. miloxacin was less active against a pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a streptococcus pyogenes infection.
uk31214, a new aminoglycoside and derivative of kanamycin b.
the in vitro activity of uk31214, a kanamycin b derivative, was studied against 250 recent isolates and compared with other aminoglycosides. against the enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii) uk31214 and amikacin had similar degrees of activity (mode minimum inhibitory concentration [mic], 1 microgram/ml). proteus mirabilis and p. stuartii strains were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to amikacin than to uk31214. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were equally susceptible to both amikacin and uk31214 (mode mic, 4 microgram/ml), but tobramycin was the most active antimicrobial agent tested (mode mic, 0.25 microgram/ml). the gentamicin-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were equally susceptible to uk31214 and amikacin. strains of staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to gentamicin or tobramycin than to uk31214 or amikacin (mode mic, 0.5 microgram/ml). a synergistic interaction between uk31214 and carbenicillin was demonstrated.
[fosfomycin, a new antibiotic: in vitro activity compared with mezlocillin, cefuroxime and gentamicin].
in vitro investigations with fosfomycin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin  against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae an pseudomonadaceae were carried out by agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar. the fosfomycin breakpoint for the low dosage of 2-3 times 3 g per infusion daily was defined with 16 micro g/ml and for the high dosage of 2-3 times 5 g fosfomycin per infusion with 64 micro g/ml. at a concentration of 16 micro g/l fosfomycin more than 90% of the cultures of staph. aureus (penicillin-resistant), e. coli, proteus mirabilis an proteus vulgaris examined were inhibited. at a concentration of less than 64 micro g/ml fosfomycin 80 toi 100% of the cultures of serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morgani et rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gentamicin sensitive and resistant) were inhibited. fosfomycin showed an absolute stability against many beta-lactamases of different bacterial species.
antibacterial activity of hr-756, cefoxitin and cefuroxine against multiply antibiotic-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the in vitro antibacterial activity of hr-756 compared to cefoxitin and cefuroxime. 122 multiresistant clinical isolates including enterobacteriaceae (104) and p. aeruginosa (18), which present particular problems in antibiotic chemotherapy, were selected for study. hr-756 inhibited all the stains of s. marcescens, p. mirabilis and indole-positive proteus spp. at a concentration of 1,3 and 12 micrograms/ml, respectively; beta-lactamase-producing strains were also susceptible. 90% of k. pneumoniae and more than half of the enterobacter and p. aeruginosa were inhibited from the drug at a concentration 16 microgram/ml. cefoxitin and cefuroxime were less active than hr-756. cefoxitin was more effective against s. marcescens and p. mirabilis while the same was the case with cefuroxime against k. pneumoniae strains. the greater efficiency of hr-756 over cefoxitin and cefuroxime against these multiply resistant isolates seems to be due not only to its indifference to the beta-lactamases but also to its easier penetrability into the bacterial cell.
in vitro activity of ly127935, a new 1-oxa cephalosporin, against aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
a total of 434 clinical aerobic gram-negative bacillary isolates were tested against ly127935, a new 1-oxa cephalosporin, and compared with other cephalosporins, penicillins, and aminoglycosides by a broth microdilution technique. cefotaxime (hr756), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, and ly127935 were more active, and showed lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (ranges, less than or equal to 0.12 to 2.0 micrograms/ml), than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., serratia marcescens, providencia spp., and citrobacter spp. against p. aeruginosa, pepercillin, azlocillin, and mezlocillin were the most active beta-lactam agents; 64 micrograms/ml inhibited 99, 93, and 87% of the isolates, respectively. ly127935 and cefotaxime at 16 micrograms/ml inhibited 71% of pseudomonas isolates, whereas the aminoglycosides gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml inhibited 84, 88, and 93%, respectively. minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined for all isolates and were generally the same as the minimum inhibitory concentrations.
in vitro activity of piperacillin compared with that of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae.
piperacillin (t-1220), a semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was more active than either carbenicillin or ticarcillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa; over 60% of isolates were inhibited at a concentration of 6.3 mug/ml. piperacillin was bactericidal for 84% of pseudomonas strains at 100 mug/ml, carbenicillin killed 60%, and ticarcillin killed 68% at that concentration. piperacillin was also more active than the other penicillins against isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter, and proteus mirabilis. the combination of piperacillin and tobramycin, demonstrating synergistic inhibition of 87% of strains of p. aeruginosa, was the most active of the penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations tested for synergism.
hr 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. hr 756 inhibited neisseria and haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing n. gonorrhoeae and h. influenzae. hr 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, enterobacter, and shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. it was twice as active as carbenicillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. hr 756 killed e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and p. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
[the role of enteric bacteria in childhood urinary tract infections and their in  vitro response to antimicrobial agents].
in this study, 154 cases of suspected bacterial urinary tract infection were examined bacteriologically. urine cultures yielded, e. coli in 84 patients citrobacter in 22 (c. freundii: 9, c. diversus: 9) proteus in 21 (p. vulgaris: 6, p. morgani: 4, p. rettgeri: 2. p. mirabilis: 4, lactose fermenting strains: 5), pseudomonas in 12 (p. aeruginosa: 5, other strains of pseudomonas: 7), klebsiella in 9 (k. aerogenes: 3, k. pneumonia: 6) and enterobacter in 6 patients (e. aerogenes: 1, e. cloacae: 5). in vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that gentamicin, nalidixic acid, bactrim and gantrisin were the most effective antibacterial agents respectively. multiple resistances was found in 39 strains of e. coli out of 84. in other species multiple resistance was found in varying degrees. it is concluded that. every measure should be taken to eradicate the causative organisms in the urinary tract in children.
in vitro investigations with fosfomycin on mueller-hinton agar with and without glucose-6-phosphate.
determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin in the agar dilution test on mueller-hinton agar showed that the addition of glucose-6-phosphate to the nutrient medium potentiates the action of fosfomycin against escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter and staphylococcus aureus, sometimes by as much as 256-fold. such a potentiation of action was not detectable with serratia marcescens, the individual proteus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci. fosfomycin is very effective against most medically important bacterial species on mueller-hinton agar containing 25 micrograms/ml glucose-6-phosphate. over 90% of the cultures of e. coli, citrobacter, enterobacter, s. marcescens,proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and enterococci examined were inhibited by less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml fosfomycin.
in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin compound.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin, has been determined against recent clinical isolates and compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the geometric means of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for different isolates of escherichia coli (100 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (84), pseudomonas aeruginosa (121), proteus mirabilis (52), indole-positive proteus species (9), salmonella species (19), staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive (29) and penicillin-resistant (39) were: 0.095, 0.124, 11.1, 0.095, 0.0107, 0.078, 1 and 0.95 mcg/ml, respectively. its activity was affected by rise in inoculum against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa but not against k. pneumoniae and e. coli. bactericidal activity was determined by membrane filtration method. hr 756 was found to be bactericidal to e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and proteus species. although the mics of the tested s. aureus strains were 1 mcg/ml, 5 mcg/ml of hr 756 failed to kill 99% of the inoculum within 24 hours.
in vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of activity.
the in vitro activity of piperacillin (t-1220), a new semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was investigated. the majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.12 micrograms/ml; the staphylococci and enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin was slightly more active against neisseria and haemophilus influenzae than was ampicillin. piperacillin was active against all members of the enterobacteriaceae including the klebsiella, 58% of which were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. the activity of piperacillin was at least equivalent, but generally superior, to that of ampicillin or carbenicillin on species susceptible to these drugs. most striking was its activity on pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml, and 83% were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentrations were very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations, and in most species only a slight inoculum effect was observed on the minimum bacterial values except for certain p. aeruginosa strains. a complete parallel resistance exists between piperacillin and ampicillin or carbenicillin. however, the clinical importance of this is largely mitigated by the intrinsically higher activity of piperacillin.
pc-904, a new semisynthetic penicillin.
sodium 6{d(-)-alpha(4-hydroxyl-1,5 naphthyridine-3-carboxamido)phenylacetamido} penicillanate (pc-904) is a new semisynthetic penicillin with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. at a concentration of 1.56 mug/ml, it inhibited 100% of isolates of proteus mirabilis, 89% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 67% of escherichia coli, and 45% of enterobacter spp. at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, it inhibited 75% of klebsiella spp. and 67% of serratia marcescens. pc-904 failed to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacilli when large inocula were used. some differences were noted when organisms were tested in different media or at different hydrogen ion concentrations. it is more active than mezlocillin, azlocillin, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and amoxicillin against e. coli, klebsiella spp., and p. aeruginosa.
nocardicin a, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic iv. factors influencing the in vitro activity of nocardicin a.
factors influencing the in vitro antimicrobial activity of nocardicin a against pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were investigated. sodium chloride was identified as a major inhibitor. some of the amino acids, sugars and divalent cations were found to be minor inhibitors. the presence of potassium phosphates enhanced nocardicin a activity against p. aeruginosa, but antagonized the activity against p. mirabilis.
clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from streptomyces clavuligerus.
a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
in vitro activity of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in combination against  bacteria associated with intra-abdominal sepsis.
the minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. gentamicin inhibited all strains of klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to 3.1 mug/ml and all strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with e. coli (60%). minocycline inhibited 62% of bacteroides fragilis, 71% of clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of b. fragilis, 67% of clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of e. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. antagonism between gentamicin and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.
diversity of beta-lactamase activity among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
various properties (specific activity, inducibility, substrate profile, and susceptibility to inhibitors) of the beta-lactamase activity present in 39 strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated during a two-month period in the bacteriology laboratory of a large general hospital were investigated. among the 39 strains there appeared to be at least 16 distinct enzymes. most enzymes from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus morganii were active against both penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas those from proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed activity primarily against cephalosporins. both types of enzyme were found among strains of enterobacter. there was a general correlation between amount of enzymic activity and levels of resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance may be due to variations in the roles intrinsic mechanisms play in resistance to various antibiotics.
in vitro studies with sisomicin and gentamicin.
sisomicin and gentamicin were tested in vitro against 222 clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria using the ics agar dilution procedure. the two drugs were comparable in terms of overall activity although statistical analyses of the data revealed significant differences in their activity against several genera. sisomicin was significantly more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.001), proteus mirabilis (p less than 0.005), and escherichia coli (p less than 0.01); gentamicin was significantly more active against klebsiella (p less than 0.001). in most instances, 4.0 mug/ml of either drug was inhibitory for 90% or more of the isolates of each genus tested.
the varying sensitivity to antibacterial agents of micro-organisms in pure vs. mixed cultures.
in this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) were first determined against each of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, sulfamylon, and betadine). then the sensitivity of each organism growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. the changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. sulfamylon, was associated with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. it is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they more closely simulate the real clinical situation. therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.
effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of pseudomonas aeruginsoa and enterobacteriaceae.
heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii) anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.
in vitro evaluation of tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
one hundred fifty-two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the kirby-bauer method. tobramycin was most active against s. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. all strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and indole-positive proteus species, and 80% of enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against s. aureus, four times as active against p. aeruginosa, slightly more active against e. coli and enterobacter species, equally active against p. mirabilis, and slightly less active against k. pneumoniae. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of p. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. tobramycin sterilized cultures of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 c, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.
effect of ph on the activity of erythromycin against 500 isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
erythromycin was found to be a more effective inhibitor of gram-negative bacilli  in alkaline medium than in neutral or acid medium. a definite effect was noted with all of 500 recent clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis studied, but it was most striking with e. coli. at ph 8.5 all strains, except for 14% of those of p. mirabilis, were inhibited by concentrations of erythromycin readily achieved in urine with common therapeutic doses.
effect of mg and ethylenediaminetetraacetate on the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) and novobiocin against gram-negative bacteria.
the effect of mg(2+) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) and novobiocin was determined against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis grown in trypticase soy broth or defined synthetic medium. in the presence of edta, the activity of coumermycin a(1) was significantly enhanced (8- to 40-fold) against all four organisms in the synthetic medium lacking mg(2+); novobiocin activity was increased to a lesser extent (4- to 16-fold) against three strains and remained unchanged against p. mirabilis. addition of 200 mug of mg(2+) per ml to the synthetic medium containing edta completely reversed the enhancement of activity of both antibiotics by edta only against p. aeruginosa. the addition of mg(2+) to the synthetic medium appreciably inhibited the activity of novobiocin (sixfold) but not coumermycin a(1) against e. coli, and had little or no effect on the activity of either antibiotic against the remaining organisms. k. pneumoniae showed the greatest susceptibility to both antibiotics, and addition of edta enhanced this activity from 4-fold to 20-fold in all of the media tested. subinhibitory concentrations of both antibiotics induced filament formation by all four organisms in all media. in addition, lysis of k. pneumoniae cells was observed.
in vitro activity of coumermycin a1.
the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against staphylococcus aureus. it was about 50 times more active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. coumermycin also showed good activity against group a streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against escherichia coli, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against klebsiella-enterobacter and enterococci. against p. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. the new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.
