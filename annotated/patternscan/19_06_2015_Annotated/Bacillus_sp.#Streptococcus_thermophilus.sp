TI  == bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different italian regions.
AB  == kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. the microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. the aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing. the main bacterial species found was lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. the presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis and acetobacter genera was also highlighted. in addition, lc. lactis, enterococcus sp., bacillus sp., acetobacter fabarum, acetobacter lovaniensis and acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. this work further confirms both the importance  of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16s rrna gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification  approaches.

TI  == bacillus subtilis cwlp of the sp-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting dd-endopeptidase.
AB  == for bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. we investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomi gene product (renamed cwlp). the gene is located in the sp-beta prophage region of the bacillus subtilis chromosome. inspection of the pfam database indicates that cwlp contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (slt) and peptidase m23 domains, which are similar to escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase slt70, and the staphylococcus aureus gly-gly endopeptidase lytm, respectively. the slt domain of cwlp exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the b. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (rp)-hplc and mass spectrometry revealed that the cwlp-slt domain has only muramidase activity. in addition, the  peptidase m23 domain of cwlp exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. remarkably, the m23 domain of cwlp possessed a unique zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized m23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to cwlp), which are zn(2+) dependent. both domains of cwlp could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of b. subtilis. however, the m23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of s. aureus or streptococcus thermophilus. the effect of defined  point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of cwlp is also determined.

TI  == the smr gene resides on a novel plasmid psp187 identified in a staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from unpasteurized milk.
AB  == this work describes a novel plasmid psp187 (5550 bp) carrying the small multidrug resistance determinant smr encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs). psp187 was identified in a staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from bulk milk in a dairy cattle herd in norway. sequence analysis revealed 6 putative orfs in addition to the smr gene within a cassette with identical genetic organization to that found in the psk41-like staphylococcus aureus plasmid ptz22. a protein homology search suggested the gene product of orf7 to be a putative replication initiation protein, while orf2 was predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of ftsk/spoiiie cell division-dna segregation protein families. sequence similarities to some initiator proteins of rolling circle replicons (rcr) indicated that psp187 uses a rcr mode of replication, supported by the detection of intermediate ssdna using s1 nuclease treatment and hybridization analysis. interestingly, a 30-bp sequence found upstream from orf7  showed high similarity to other dyad symmetry motifs proposed as putative double-strand origins of replication in the plasmids pgi3 (bacillus thuringiensis), pstk1 (bacillus stearothermophilus), and per1-2 (streptococcus thermophilus). in conclusion: the novel smr-containing plasmid psp187 is the first member of rcr group vi to be identified in a staphylococcus sp.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
