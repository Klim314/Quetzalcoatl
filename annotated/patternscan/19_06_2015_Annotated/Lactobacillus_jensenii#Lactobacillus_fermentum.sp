TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
AB  == background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii,  and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == [selection and genotyping of lactobacillus with potential preventive effect by repetitive element sequence-based pcr analysis].
AB  == we selected and characterized isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus)  for potential preventing infections of the female reproductive tract. we cultured vaginal swabs from healthy volunteers on de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and identified the isolates at the species level by 16s rrna sequence and genotyped the isolates of lactobacillus by pcr amplification of repetitive bacterial dna elements (rep-pcr). furthermore, 10 l. crispatus strains were assessed for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and acid production. overall 65 isolates were confirmed  to be lactobacillus by sequence analogy, among them 19 were l. crispatus, 17 were lactobacillus jensenii and 12 were lactobacillus fermentum. rep-pcr produced specie and strain-specific genomic fingerprints for the lactobacillus isolates. the selected 10 l. crispatus isolates produced highly acidic environment after growth in mrs. the isolates t22-3 and t29-5 demonstrated high production of h2o2. this study indicated that there are individual differences with vaginal lactobacillus colonization, and strain diversity within vaginal l. crispatus isolates, t22-3 and t29-5 might be candidates for restoring urogenital health environment in females.

TI  == (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional cachaca fermentations.
AB  == during the production of traditional cachaca (alembic s cachaca), contamination of the fermented must is one of the factors leading to economic losses in the beverage manufacturing industry. the diversity of bacterial populations and the role of these microorganisms during the cachaca production process are still poorly understood in brazil. in our work, the fermentation process was followed in two distilleries located in the state of minas gerais. the objective of this work was to identify the populations of lactic acid bacteria present during cachaca fermentation using physiological and molecular methods. lactic acid bacteria were isolated in high frequencies during all of the fermentative processes, and lactobacillus plantarum and l. casei were the most prevalent species. other lactic acid bacteria were found in minor frequencies, such as l. ferintoshensis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. murinus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sp. and weissella confusa. these bacteria could contribute to the increase of volatile acidity levels or to the production of compounds that could  influence the taste and aroma of the beverage.

TI  == lactobacillus bacteremia, species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility of 85 blood isolates.
AB  == background: data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical lactobacillus isolates are scarce, and appropriate interpretation criteria for susceptibility tests are not available. methods: we examined 85 cases of lactobacillus bacteremia, of which 47 cases have been included in our previous studies. overall, 14 antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the e-test method, and these results were compared with disk diffusion test findings. the clinical outcomes of the patients and their antimicrobial treatments were registered. results: the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactobacillus strains was species dependent. the  considerable number of lactobacillus rhamnosus (n=46), lactobacillus fermentum (n=12), and lactobacillus casei (n=12) strains available for testing made it possible to compare the susceptibilities within 1 species, as well. of the 46 l.  rhamnosus isolates, 22 were identified as l. rhamnosus gg type by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all lactobacillus isolates demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin. mics of vancomycin were high (>256 microg/ml) for  all other species except lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. disk diffusion and e-test results were concordant. the mics of cephalosporins varied;  cefuroxime demonstrated a higher level of activity than did ceftriaxone. benzylpenicillin and ampicillin mics had variable ranges between different species. combination therapy was given to 83% of the patients, but, in 54% of them, therapy included only 1 microbiologically active agent, according to results of the susceptibility tests. mortality at 1 week was 12% among patients who presumably were receiving adequate treatment and 27% among patients who were  receiving inadequate treatment (p=.131, by e-test). conclusion: most clinical lactobacillus blood isolates demonstrated low mics of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but they had variable susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporins.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei in a murine model of escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == differentiation of lactobacillus species by molecular typing.
AB  == a total of 64 type, reference, clinical, health food, and stock isolates of microaerophilic lactobacillus species were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. of particular interest were members of six of the eight species most commonly recovered from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women,  namely, lactobacillus jensenii, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, and l. fermentum. six main groupings were identified on the basis of ribotyping. this technique was able to classify fresh isolates to the species level. in the case of the ribotype a grouping for l. rhamnosus, differences between strains were evident by chromosome typing (chromotyping). many isolates did not possess plasmids. six l. rhamnosus strains isolated from four different health food products appeared to be identical to l. rhamnosus atcc 21052. the molecular typing system is useful for identifying and differentiating lactobacillus isolates. studies of strains of potential importance to the urogenital flora should include molecular characterization as a means of comparing genetic traits with those of strains whose characteristics associated with colonization and antagonism against pathogens have been defined.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == [a microflora study of the gastrointestinal tract of mink housed within and outside of the area of the chernobyl atomic electric power station].
AB  == quantitative differences in the content of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the content of the stomach, small and large intestine have been established when studying microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of minks kept in the 30-kilometer zone of the chernobyl npp (experimental animals) and at the cherkassy fur farm (control animals). obligate heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria related to lactobacillus fermentum and l. reuteri prevailed  in the stomach of experimental minks. species composition of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the stomach of the cherkassy minks is characterized by the availability of both obligate and facultative heterofermentative species of bacteria--l. bavaricus, l. coryniformis, l. reuteri and of obligate homofermentative bacteria--l. salivarius and l. jensenii. in limiting dilutions (10(-9)-10(-10)) of the content of small intestine of the control minks one could find bacteria of l. coryniformis species and representatives of obligate heterofermentative bacteria--l. confusus and l. fermentum that is 1-2 orders higher then in the experimental minks. both lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (the latter up to 10(+9) cells/g of the content) were isolated from the lower departments of small and large intestine of the chernobyl and cherkassy minks. among the species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the experimental animals homofermentative species (l. acidophilus, l. sharpeae) and,  heterofermentative (l. confusus, l. fermentum) in the control were found.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
