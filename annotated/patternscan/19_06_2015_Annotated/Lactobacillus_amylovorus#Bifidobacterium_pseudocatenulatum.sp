TI  == two families of rep-like genes that probably originated by interspecies recombination are represented in viral, plasmid, bacterial, and parasitic protozoan genomes.
AB  == two families of genes related to, and including, rolling circle replication initiator protein (rep) genes were defined by sequence similarity and by evidence of intergene family recombination. the rep genes of circoviruses were the best characterized members of the "recrep1 family." other members of the recrep1 family were rep-like genes found in the genomes of the canarypox virus, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia duodenalis and in a plasmid, p4m, from the gram-positive bacterium, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the "recrep2 family" comprised some previously identified rep-like genes from plasmids of phytoplasmas and similar rep-like genes from the genomes of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactococcus lactis, and phytoplasma asteris. both recrep1 and recrep2 proteins have a nucleotide-binding domain significantly similar to the helicases (2c proteins) of picorna-like viruses. on the n-terminal side of the nucleotide binding domain, recrep1 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one found in nanovirus reps, whereas recrep2 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one in the  reps of pls1 plasmids. we speculate that recrep genes have been transferred from  viruses or plasmids to parasitic protozoan and bacterial genomes and that rep proteins were themselves involved in the original recombination events that generated the ancestral recrep genes.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-two strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species have been tested against 12 antibiotics and two antibiotic mixtures by a commercial system (sensititre anaero3; treck diagnostic systems). the upper limits of some minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were completed on mrs agar plates by the nccls procedure. all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and imipenem and most of the strains were resistant to metronidazole. bifidobacteria isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, whereas about half of the  lactobacilli were resistant. approximately 30% of the bifidobacterium isolates were resistant to tetracycline, as well as five lactobacillus strains belonging to four different species. none of the tested bifidobacterium isolates was resistant to vancomycin, whereas a species-dependent resistance was found among the lactobacilli. single strains of bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus brevis were resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin. most of the observed resistances seemed to be intrinsic, but some others could be compatible with transmissible determinants.
