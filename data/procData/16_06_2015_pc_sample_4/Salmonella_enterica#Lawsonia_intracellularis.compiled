TI  - Antimicrobial activities of active component isolated from Lawsonia inermis leaves and structure-activity relationships of its analogues against food-borne bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of Lawsonia inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues against food-borne bacteria. The antimicrobial activities of five fractions derived from the methanol extract of Lawsonia inermis leaves were evaluated against 7 food-borne bacteria. 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was isolated by chromatographic analyses. 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone showed the strong activities against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S. intermedius, but exerted no growth-inhibitory activities against S. typhimurium. The antimicrobial activities of the 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues were tested against 7 food-borne bacteria to establish structure-activity relationships. Hydroxyl (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), methoxy (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and methyl (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) functional groups on the 1,4-naphthoquinone skeleton possessed potent activities, whereas bromo (2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-naphthoquione) and chloro (2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone) exhibited no activity against 7 food-borne bacteria. The L. inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues should be useful as natural antimicrobial agents against food-borne bacteria.
TI  - Occurrence of pathogens in wild rodents caught on Swedish pig and chicken farms.
AB  - A total of 207 wild rodents were caught on nine pig farms, five chicken farms and five non-farm locations in Sweden and surveyed for a selection of bacteria, parasites and viruses. Lawsonia intracellularia and pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica were only detected in rodents on pig farms (9% and 8% prevalence, respectively) which indicate that these agents are more likely to be transmitted to rodents from pigs or the environment on infected farms. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (1%), Brachyspira intermedia (2%), Campylobacter jejuni (4%), Campylobacter upsaliensis (2%), leptospires (7%) and encephalomyocarditis virus (9%) were also detected from rodents not in contact with farm animals. Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. were common, although no zoonotic types were verified, and Salmonella enterica was isolated from 1/11 mice on one farm but not detected by PCR from any of the rodents. Trichinella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii were not detected.
TI  - Experimental reproduction of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-associated enteritis in pigs infected with PCV2 alone or concurrently with Lawsonia intracellularis or Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Porcine circovirus (PCV)-associated disease (PCVAD) has emerged to become one of  the most economically important pig diseases globally. One of the less commonly recognized clinical manifestations of PCVAD is PCV2 type 2 (PCV2)-associated enteritis in growing pigs; however, experimental confirmation of the ability of PCV2 alone or PCV2 coinfection with other agent(s) to induce enteritis is lacking. In this study, 120 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were divided randomly into six groups: controls (negative control pigs), PCV2 (inoculated with PCV2), LAW (inoculated with Lawsonia intracellularis), SALM (inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium), PCV2-LAW (concurrently inoculated with PCV2 and Lawsonia intracellularis) and PCV2-SALM (concurrently inoculated with PCV2 and Salmonella typhimurium). One half of the pigs in each group were subject to necropsy examination 14 days postinoculation (dpi) and the remaining pigs were examined at 28 dpi. The average daily weight gain was not different (P>0.05) between groups. Individual pigs inoculated orally with PCV2 regardless of coinfection status (2/10 PCV2, 1/10 PCV2-LAW, 3/10 PCV2-SALM) developed PCVAD with diarrhoea and reduced weight gain or weight loss between 14 and 28 dpi. Those pigs had characteristic microscopic lesions in lymphoid and enteric tissues associated with abundant PCV2 antigen. Enteric lesions were characterized by necrosuppurative and proliferative enteritis with crypt elongation and epithelial hyperplasia in LAW and PCV2-LAW pigs by 14 dpi, ulcerative and necrosuppurative colitis in SALM and PCV2-SALM pigs by 14 dpi, and lymphohistiocytic enteritis with depletion of Peyer's patches in PCV2, PCV2-SALM and PCV2-LAW pigs by 28 dpi. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report documenting that under experimental conditions, PCV2 can induce enteritis independently from other enteric pathogens and that oral challenge is a potentially important route and perhaps the natural route of PCV2 transmission in growing pigs.
TI  - Prevalence of selected enteropathogenic bacteria in Hungarian finishing pigs.
AB  - The aim of this study was to obtain prevalence estimates about the most important enteropathogenic bacteria: Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Brachyspira pilosicoli, Salmonella enterica and Clostridium perfringens A and C in Hungarian farrow-to-finish pig herds. A total of 31 herds were selected, from where six pooled faecal samples, each containing three individual rectal faecal samples were collected from fattening pigs of 5-6 months of age. All 186 samples were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the pathogens mentioned above. Lawsonia intracellularis was found in 29 herds (93.55%) and in 108 samples (58.06%); B. hyodysenteriae in 14 herds (45.16%) and in 23 samples (12.37%); B. pilosicoli in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 53 samples (28.49%); S. enterica in 17 herds (54.83%) and in 40 samples (21.50%). We detected the presence of C. perfringens A in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 46 samples (24.73%), while C. perfringens C was found in 8 herds (25.81%) and in 11 samples (5.91%). All examined herds were infected with one or more of these agents. Herds with diarrhoea in the mid- to late finishing phase had almost 10 times higher prevalence of B. hyodysenteriae than herds without such a history.
TI  - Lawsonia intracellularis infection in the large intestines of pigs.
AB  - In this study we examined the proliferative enteropathy, caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis, in colon of naturally infected pigs, using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation and scanning confocal laser microscopy. When 396 pigs submitted for routine laboratory examination were investigated, large intestinal gross lesions were seen in 93, including 74 cases of L. intracellularis colitis (proliferative enteropathy). Fifty-one pigs without recorded colonic gross lesions revealed L. intracellularis colitis microscopically. In four cases, L. intracellularis was only revealed in colon. Fifty-seven pigs were positive for L. intracellularis in the small intestines only. Thus, the overall prevalence of colonic infection in L. intracellularis-positive animals was as high as 69% (125 out of 182). In comparison, the large intestinal pathogens Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Salmonella enterica were only isolated from 5 and 4 of the 93 cases, respectively. Morphologically, an unforeseen severe involvement of the subepithelial mucosa with multiple L. intracellularis found free and within large macrophages was observed in areas with acute infection. The distribution of whole L. intracellularis organisms was confirmed by in situ hybridisation and scanning confocal laser microscopy. The significance and possible role of subepithelial infection in the proliferative enteropathy is discussed. In conclusion, the study shows that L. intracellularis is a prevalent cause of naturally acquired colitis in pigs.
TI  - Risk factors for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica shedding by market-age pigs  in French farrow-to-finish herds.
AB  - Fattening-pigs carriers of Salmonella enterica are believed to be a main source of carcass and pork contamination at the later steps of the meat process. We did a prospective study in 2000-2001 in 105 French farrow-to-finish pig farms. In each farm, a batch of contemporary fattening pigs housed in the same room was followed throughout the fattening period. Salmonella shedding was assessed on environmental samples of faecal material (taken by means of pairs of gauze socks) analysed by classical bacteriological methods. 36.2% of the batches studied had at least one contaminated environmental sample and therefore were classified as Salmonella-shedding batches. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between managerial and hygiene practices and health status and the shedding risk at the end of the finishing period. Emptying the pit below the slatted floor after the previous batch of sows was removed and frequent removal of sow dung during the lactation period were protective. Presence of residual Salmonella contamination of the floor and pen partitions in the fattening rooms before loading the growing pigs also was a risk factor. The risk for Salmonella shedding at the end of the fattening period was increased when dry feed (versus wet feed) was provided during the fattening period. Lastly, Lawsonia intracellularis seroconversion and PRRSV seropositivity during the fattening period also was a risk factor for Salmonella shedding.
TI  - Prevalence of intestinal pathogens in Danish finishing pig herds.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of the intestinal bacteria: Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Serpulina intermedia, Brachyspira innocens, Brachyspira pilosicoli, pathogenic Escherichia coli (serogroups O138, O139, O141 and O149) and Salmonella enterica in Danish finishing pig herds. A total of 79 herds was randomly selected and visited during 1998. From each herd, 20 faecal samples were collected from individual pigs weighing 30-50kg. Furthermore, 10 pooled pen samples were collected and examined for S. enterica. In total, 1580 faecal samples and 790 pen samples were collected and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. L. intracellularis was found in 74 herds (93.7%), B. hyodysenteriae in two herds (2.5%), S. intermedia in 10 herds (12. 7%), B. innocens in 27 herds (34.2%), B. pilosicoli in 15 herds (19. 0%), pathogenic E. coli in 19 herds (24.1%) and S. enterica in eight herds (10.1%). The within-herd prevalences of L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae were 25-30%; the within-herd prevalences of the other agents were 5-10%. Three herds (4%) were not infected with any of the bacteria and 25 herds (32%) were only infected with L. intracellularis.
TI  - Comparative pathology of bacterial enteric diseases of swine.
AB  - Enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. Clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. The most common etiological agents include Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella enterica, and Brachyspira (Serpulina) spp. With the exception of Brachyspira (Serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine dysentery, and Lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy, the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. Histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic E. coli and C. perfringens type A), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic E. coli and Brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with S. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain C. perfringens. Extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of E. coli and most serotypes of S. enterica. Enteric bacterial diseases of swine have been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. Several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.
TI  - Detection of Lawsonia intracellularis, Serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes, Salmonella enterica, and haemolytic Escherichia coli from swine herds with and without diarrhoea among growing pigs.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized to detect Lawsonia intracellularis in faeces from naturally infected pigs. By combining a boiling procedure to extract DNA and a nested PCR procedure, a detection limit at 2 x 10(2) bacterial cells per gram of faeces was achieved. The optimized PCR was used together with conventional culture techniques to detect Serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes (WBHIS), Salmonella enterica, and haemolytic Escherichia coli, in a case control study to examine selected risk factors for the development of diarrhoea in growing pigs. Herds with diarrhoea were selected as cases and randomly chosen herds without diarrhoea were chosen as controls. Infection with L. intracellularis significantly enhanced the chance of diarrhoea. S. hyodysenteriae, WBHIS group IV (Serpulina pilosicoli), and S. enterica were isolated only from case herds which indicate that these species may influence the development of diarrhoea. In addition, herd-type had a significant impact, that is specific pathogen-free herds showed an odds ratio at 0.2 relative to conventional herds for the development of diarrhoea.
