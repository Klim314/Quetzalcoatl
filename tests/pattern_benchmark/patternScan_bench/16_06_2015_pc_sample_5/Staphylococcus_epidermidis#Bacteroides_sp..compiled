TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - Microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in Malaysia.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. Seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period January 1985 to December 1988. More than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. Chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. Approximately 25% of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections. Pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. Streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being Streptococcus milleri. Proteus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putrifaciens and Bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. Streptococcus milleri, Bacteroides sp and Eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. In patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. Anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. Culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the detection of the anaerobes. Based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative wound infection: a prospective study of 1770 wounds.
AB  - A prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. Intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. Of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. Wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. The figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. The commonest causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, Escherichia coli 16.9%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. When isolated intra-operatively, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound infection, but the intra-operative isolation of Bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - The charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. All patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. The most common organisms cultured were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, Candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, Enterobacter, 16 cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. The classic isolates, Escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. To determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. Candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and S. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. The spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those with acute peritonitis. Despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.
TI  - Distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  - The gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. Gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. A colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Enterobacter aerogenes, and a Fusobacterium sp. was established. These gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. Except for the presence of large numbers of Bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of S. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. Bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism in conventional gerbils. Microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. Intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. Intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils were similar. Histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. Spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. Statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - A simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the Caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  - An efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of Caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. The Caesarean-derived infant Dutch or Japanese-White rabbits and their hybrids (F1; Japanese-White female x Dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, A and B, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (Esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (Table 2) and administered intragastrically once a day through a Nelaton's catheter. Bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. On the third day, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. The weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (Table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of Esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. There was, however, no significant difference milk diet A and B on the weaning rate.
TI  - A special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  - A 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. There is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. Three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. Another died. At autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. The deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The autopsy findings showed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of SCID. After a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (DV) was placed in the isolator. Laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. The patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. Subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four HLA matches but none has been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. Approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. Those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), Bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, Clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), Bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-Alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Microcossu sp. subgroup 1, Bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-Candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). Seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: P. acnes, C. bifermentans, B. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, E. agglomerans, C. parapsilosis. No viruses or protozoa have been isolated. At age 3 years, the mean quantitation of anaerobic cells was 7.9 X 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. The mean aerobic concentration was 1.2 X 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. Qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. This child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
