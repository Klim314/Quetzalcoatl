TI  == lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is a taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens.  they are extensively used in a variety of commercial products including probiotics. their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined in part because of their taxonomic complexity and are compounded by the different methods recommended by clinical laboratory standards institute and international dairy foundation. their use as probiotics for prevention of clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of will  the use of any concurrent antibiotic effect their ability to survive. lactobacillus species are generally acid resistant and are able to survive ingestion. they are generally resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin with l. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas l. rhamnosus and l. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.

TI  == a decade of experience in primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection at a community hospital using the probiotic combination lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+).
AB  == in august 2003, the 284-bed community hospital pierre-le gardeur (plgh) in quebec experienced a major outbreak associated with the clostridium difficile nap1/027/bi strain. augmented standard preventive measures (spms) were not able to control this outbreak. it was decided in february 2004 to give to every adult  inpatient on antibiotics, without any exclusion, a probiotic (bio-k+: lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2) within 12 hours of the antibiotic prescription. augmented spms were continued. the use of the probiotic in addition to spms was associated with  a marked reduction of c. difficile infection (cdi). during the 10 years of observation, 44 835 inpatients received bio-k+, and the cdi rate at plgh declined from 18.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. additionally, 10-year data collected by the ministry of health in quebec comparing the cdi rate between quebec hospitals showed that cdi rates at plgh were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals. blood cultures were monitored at plgh for lactobacillus bacteremia through the 10 years' experience, and no lactobacillus bacteremias were detected. despite the limitation of an observational study, we concluded that the probiotic bio-k+ was safe and effective in decreasing our primary cdi rate.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+): characterization, manufacture, mechanisms of action, and quality control of a specific probiotic combination for primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == a specific probiotic formulation composed of lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+) has been marketed in north america since 1996. the strains and the commercial products have been evaluated for safety, identity, gastrointestinal survival, and stability throughout shelf life. the capacity of both the fermented beverages and the capsules to reduce incidences of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection (cdi) has been demonstrated in human clinical trials. individual strains and the finished products have shown antimicrobial activity against c. difficile and toxin a/b neutralization capacity in vitro. the use of this specific probiotic formulation as part of a bundle of preventive measures to control cdi in healthcare settings is discussed.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus l34 and lactobacillus casei l39 suppress clostridium difficile-induced il-8 production by colonic epithelial cells.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and colitis known as c. difficile-associated disease (cdad).with increased severity and failure of treatment in cdad, new approaches for prevention and treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed. since the pathogenesis of cdad involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils recruited by interleukin (il)-8, this study aimed to investigate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus spp. on the suppression of il-8 production in response to c. difficile infection. results: we screened lactobacillus conditioned media from 34 infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress c. difficile-induced il-8 production from ht-29 cells. factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli, l. rhamnosus l34 (lr-l34) and l.casei l39 (lc-l39), suppressed the  secretion and transcription of il-8 without inhibiting c. difficile viability or  toxin production. conditioned media from lr-l34 suppressed the activation of phospho-nf-kappab with no effect on phospho-c-jun. however, lc-l39 conditioned media suppressed the activation of both phospho-nf-kappab and phospho-c-jun. conditioned media from lr-l34 and lc-l39 also decreased the production of c. difficile-induced gm-csf in ht-29 cells. immunomodulatory factors present in the  conditioned media of both lr-l34 and lc-l39 are heat-stable up to 100 degrees c and > 100 kda in size. conclusions: our results suggest that l. rhamnosus l34 and l. casei l39 each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated by c. difficile. these vancomycin-resistant lactobacillus strains are potential probiotics for treating or preventing cdad.

TI  == deciphering meta-analytic results: a mini-review of probiotics for the prevention of paediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile infections.
AB  == meta-analyses are used to evaluate pooled effects of a wide variety of investigational agents, but the interpretation of the results into clinical practices may be difficult. this mini-review offers a three-step process to enable healthcare providers to decipher pooled meta-analysis estimates into results that are useful for therapeutic decisions. as an example of how meta-analyses should be interpreted, a recent meta-analysis of probiotics for the prevention of paediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and the prevention of clostridium difficile infections (cdi) will be used. first, the pooled results of this meta-analysis indicates a significant protective efficacy for aad is found when the 16 different types of probiotics are combined (pooled relative risk (rr) = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (ci)=0.33-0.56) and also a significant  reduction of paediatric cdi (pooled rr=0.34, 95%ci=0.16-0.74) was found pooling four different types of probiotics. secondly, because the efficacy of probiotics  is strain-specific, it is necessary to do a sensitivity analysis, restricting the meta-analysis to one specific strain. two strains, saccharomyces boulardii lyo and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg showed significant efficacy for paediatric aad when pooled (pooled rr for s. boulardii = 0.43, 95%ci=0.21-0.86 and pooled rr for l. rhamnosus gg = 0.44, 95%ci=0.20-0.95). thirdly, if studies within probiotic types have different results, it is prudent to examine these studies individually to determine the reasons why non-significant differences in efficacy were found.  by drilling down through these three analytic layers, physicians will be confident in recommending the correct probiotic strain to their patients.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria against clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) has become a significant threat to public health. although broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is the primary treatment option for cdi, its use has evident limitations. probiotics have been proved to be effective in the treatment of cdi and are a promising therapeutic option for cdi. in this study, 4 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr5), lactococcuslactis (sl3), bifidobacterium breve (br3), and bifidobacterium lactis (bl3) were evaluated for their anti-c. difficile activity. co-culture incubation of c. difficile (10(6) and 10(10) cfu/ml) with each strain of lab indicated that sl3 possessed the highest antimicrobial activity over a 24-hr period. the cell-free supernatants of the 4 lab strains exhibited mic50 values between 0.424 mg/ml (sl3) and 1.318 (br3) mg/ml. these results may provide a basis for alternative therapies for the treatment of c. difficile-associated gut disorders.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

TI  == bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == [outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
AB  == introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of  stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful  therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  == probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in  the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins  inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.

TI  == [assessment of antagonistic activity in vitro lactobacillus spp. strains againts  clostridum difficile strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of patients hospitalized in three hospitals in region mazovia].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic activity of  lactobacillus strains against clinical c. difficile strains isolated from faecal  samples of adults patients with diarrhea. a total 61 strains of c. difficile randomly selected isolated in the period 2007-2008 from the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients in three hospitals province mazovia, poland. to determination of antagonistic activity ofprobiotic lactobacillus spp. strains used four reference strains: lactobacillus plantarum 2017405, lactobacillus fermentum 353, lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 21007 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. methods: isolation of c. difficile was performed on selective columbia agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxitine and amphothericin b (clo medium, biomerieux, france). the plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 h at 37 degrees c. isolates were identified as c. difficile by the characteristic morphology of the colonies and horse-like odour, green yellow fluorescence under  uv. toxigenicity of of c. difficile strains was determined in pcr to detection of fragments of genes encoding toxin a (tcda), toxin b (tcdb) and binary toxin (cdta and cdtb). the study of antagonistic activity four lactobacillus spp. strains against 61 clinical c. difficile strains was performed according to standard methods. lactobacillus strains were inoculated on mrs medium and incubated in oxygen-free atmosphere and cut the bars of mrs agar and applied to the plate with cultures of c. difficile strains. results: assessment of antagonist activity of lactobacillus spp. strains was performed by measuring the zone of inhibition of grown of c. difficile strains. the study shows that of probiotic lactobacillus spp. strains interacted antagonistically in vitro against all toxigenic (a+b+cdt- and a+b+cdt+) of c. difficile strains. conclusions: the differences in the antagonistic activity of lactobacillus spp. strains against different toxigenic clinical c. difficile strains were not observed.

TI  == enveloped virus but not bacteria block il-13 responses in human cord blood t cells in vitro.
AB  == infections that occur early in life may have a beneficial effect on the immune system and thereby reduce the risk of allergen sensitization and/or allergic disease. it is not yet clear to what extent specific virus and/or bacteria can mediate this effect. the purpose of this study was to assess the role of virus and bacteria in cd4(+) t cell-derived cytokine production in newborns. we compared the effects of five bacteria (staphlococcus aureus, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium bifidus) and seven virus (adenovirus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, morbillivirus and poliovirus) on the th1/th2 cytokine production in mixed lymphocyte reactions using cd4(+) t cells from cord blood cocultured with allogenic myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells. when comparing the baseline cytokine production prior to microbial stimulation, we observed that cord plasmacytoid dc were stronger inducers of th2 cytokines (il-5 and il-13) compared with cord myeloid dc and to adult dc. when adding microbes to these cultures, bacteria and virus differed in two major respects; firstly, all enveloped viruses, but none of the bacteria, blocked th2 (il-13) production by cord cd4(+) cells. secondly, all gram-positive bacteria, but none of the virus, induced il-12p40 responses, but the il-12p40 responses did not affect th1 cytokine production (ifn-gamma). instead, th1 responses were correlated with the  capacity to induce ifn-alpha secretion, which in cord cells were induced by s. aureus and influenza virus alone. these data imply that enveloped virus can deviate th2 responses in human cord t cells.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == probiotic cheese containing lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm(r) modifies subpopulations of fecal lactobacilli and clostridium difficile in the elderly.
AB  == aging is associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota and with immunosenescence. probiotics have the potential to modify a selected part of the  intestinal microbiota as well as improve immune functions and may, therefore, be  particularly beneficial to elderly consumers. in this randomized, controlled cross-over clinical trial, we assessed the effects of a probiotic cheese containing lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm on the intestinal microbiota and fecal immune markers of 31 elderly volunteers and compared these effects with the administration of the same cheese without probiotics. the probiotic cheese was found to increase the number of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus ncfm in the feces, suggesting the survival of the strains during the gastrointestinal transit. importantly, probiotic cheese administration was associated with a trend towards lower counts of clostridium difficile in the  elderly, as compared with the run-in period with the plain cheese. the effect was statistically significant in the subpopulation of the elderly who harbored c. difficile at the start of the study. the probiotic cheese was not found to significantly alter the levels of the major microbial groups, suggesting that the microbial changes conferred by the probiotic cheese were limited to specific bacterial groups. despite that the administration of the probiotic cheese to the  study population has earlier been shown to significantly improve the innate immunity of the elders, we did not observe measurable changes in the fecal immune iga concentrations. no increase in fecal calprotectin and beta-defensin concentrations suggests that the probiotic treatment did not affect intestinal inflammatory markers. in conclusion, the administration of probiotic cheese containing l. rhamnosus hn001 and l. acidophilus ncfm, was associated with specific changes in the intestinal microbiota, mainly affecting specific subpopulations of intestinal lactobacilli and c. difficile, but did not have significant effects on the major microbial groups or the fecal immune markers.

TI  == fecal bacteriotherapy for relapsing clostridium difficile infection in a child: a proposed treatment protocol.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is a potentially serious emerging infectious disease. the incidences of cdi in childhood and cdi cases complicated  by relapses have increased by 50% or more in north america during the past 2 decades. we report here the case of a 2-year-old child with relapsing cdi caused  by the epidemic strain bi/nap1/o27 that was refractory to saccharomyces boulardii and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg probiotics and to intensive therapy with traditional (metronidazole, vancomycin) and experimental (rifaximin, nitazoxanide) antibiotics despite its apparent antimicrobial-susceptible phenotype. after excluding other infectious causes of diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease, we designed a protocol to safely administer fecal bacteriotherapy  via a temporary nasogastric tube. we demonstrated for the first time that fecal transplantation is practical and effective for treating relapsing cdi in a young  child. we recommend that this strategy be reserved for complicated cases of cdi that fail conventional therapy until randomized studies can confirm the safety and effectiveness of fecal bacteriotherapy in children.

TI  == probiotic prophylaxis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a blinded, randomized,  controlled trial.
AB  == rationale: enteral administration of probiotics may modify the gastrointestinal environment in a manner that preferentially favors the growth of minimally virulent species. it is unknown whether probiotic modification of the upper aerodigestive flora can reduce nosocomial infections. objectives: to determine whether oropharyngeal and gastric administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg can reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). methods: we performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 146 mechanically ventilated patients at high risk of developing vap. patients were randomly assigned to receive enteral probiotics (n = 68) or an inert inulin-based placebo (n = 70) twice a day in addition to routine care. measurements and main results: patients treated with lactobacillus were significantly less likely to develop microbiologically confirmed vap compared with patients treated with placebo (40.0 vs. 19.1%; p = 0.007). although patients treated with probiotics had significantly less clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea than patients treated with placebo (18.6 vs. 5.8%; p = 0.02), the duration of diarrhea per episode was not different between groups (13.2 +/- 7.4 vs. 9.8 +/- 4.9 d; p = 0.39). patients treated with probiotics had fewer days of  antibiotics prescribed for vap (8.6 +/- 10.3 vs. 5.6 +/- 7.8 d; p = 0.05) and for c. difficile-associated diarrhea (2.1 +/- 4.8 sd d vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 d; p = 0.02).  no adverse events related to probiotic administration were identified. conclusions: these pilot data suggest that l. rhamnosus gg is safe and efficacious in preventing vap in a select, high-risk icu population. clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (nct00613795).

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of rep3123 against clostridium difficile and other  anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the anaerobic spectrum of activity of rep3123, a novel diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl-trna synthetases in gram-positive bacteria. methods: fifty recent clinical isolates of clostridium difficile from patients diagnosed with c. difficile infection and 223 other intestinal normal flora anaerobes were tested for their susceptibility to rep3123 and four or five comparator agents by the agar dilution method using supplemented brucella agar with 5% laked sheep blood. results: all strains of c.  difficile were inhibited by 0.5-1 mg/l rep3123, including those resistant to moxifloxacin and clindamycin. rep3123 lacked activity against many normal flora anaerobes in the gut, including clostridium ramosum, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli of the lactobacillus casei-rhamnosus-plantarum group and gram-negative anaerobes. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated good potency against c. difficile, but limited  activity against many other intestinal anaerobic species, thus, in theory, maintaining the colonization resistance barrier.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

AB  == purpose of review: to critically appraise evidence on probiotic use for prevention and treatment of diarrhea in children and adults. recent findings: several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggested that probiotics  are effective in primary and secondary prevention of gastroenteritis and its treatment. selected lactobacillus strains had a modest, although significant effect in primary prevention. saccharomyces boulardii was effective in antibiotic-associated and in clostridium difficile diarrhea. there is evidence that it might prevent diarrhea in day-care centers. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg was associated with reduced diarrheal duration and severity, more evident in case of childhood rotavirus diarrhea. similar, although weaker, evidence was obtained  with s. boulardii. both strains are included in evidence-based recommendations for gastroenteritis management in children. data on other lactobacillus strains are preliminary. probiotic efficacy was related to cause, early administration and bacterial load, and their mechanisms were associated with antiinfectious action in the intestine or, indirectly, to modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. summary: probiotics have gained a role as adjunctive treatment of infantile gastroenteritis together with rehydration. their efficacy is less convincing in adults, but promising in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. however, evidence of efficacy is limited to a few strains.

TI  == clinical trial: effectiveness of lactobacillus rhamnosus (strains e/n, oxy and pen) in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children.
AB  == background: convincing evidence that probiotic administration can lower the risk  of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is limited to certain micro-organisms. aim: to determine the efficacy of administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus (strains e/n, oxy and pen) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children. methods: children (aged 3 months to 14 years) with common infections were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which they received standard antibiotic treatment plus 2 x 10(10) colony forming units of a  probiotic (n = 120) or a placebo (n = 120), administered orally twice daily throughout antibiotic treatment. analyses were by intention to treat. results: any diarrhoea (>or=3 loose or watery stools/day for >or=48 h occurring during or  up to 2 weeks after the antibiotic therapy) occurred in nine (7.5%) patients in the probiotic group and in 20 (17%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk, rr 0.45, 95% confidence interval, ci 0.2-0.9). three (2.5%) children in the probiotic group developed aad (diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile or otherwise unexplained diarrhoea) compared to nine (7.5%) in the placebo group (rr 0.33, 95% ci 0.1-1.06). no adverse events were observed. conclusion: administration of l. rhamnosus (strains e/n, oxy and pen) to children receiving antibiotics reduced the risk of any diarrhoea, as defined in this study.

TI  == probiotics: sorting the evidence from the myths.
AB  == probiotics consist of yeast or bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria. they are available as capsules, powder, fermented milks or yoghurts. probiotics exhibit strain-specific differences in their resistance to acid and bile, ability to colonise the gastrointestinal tract, clinical efficacy, and benefits to the health of the host. there is level i evidence for the use of probiotics in treating acute infectious diarrhoea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and saccharomyces boulardii having the most evidence to support their use for these conditions. there is level ii evidence that s. boulardii combined with high-dose vancomycin is more effective than the antibiotic alone in preventing recurrent clostridium difficile diarrhoea. there is level i evidence that probiotics prevent traveller's diarrhoea. there is level i evidence for use of the high-potency probiotic vsl#3  in preventing pouchitis, and level ii evidence for this agent in preventing relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis. probiotics are generally regarded as safe and well tolerated. some probiotics may be contraindicated in patients who are immunocompromised or have severe underlying illness, as they have been reported to cause fungaemia and bacteraemia.

TI  == probiotics for treatment of clostridium difficile-associated colitis in adults.
AB  == background: probiotics are live microorganisms consisting of non-pathogenic yeast and bacteria that are believed to restore the microbial balance of the gastrointestinal tract altered by infection with clostridium difficile (c. difficile). objectives: to assess the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of  antibiotic associated c. difficile colitis. search strategy: the databases medline, embase, the cochrane central register of controlled trials and cochrane  ibd/fbd specialized trials register were searched to locate all published reports from 1966 to 2007. selection criteria: randomized, prospective studies using probiotics alone or in conjunction with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of documented c. difficile colitis were eligible for inclusion. data collection and analysis: data extraction and analysis was done independently by two authors. main results: four studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. the four studies examined the use of probiotics in conjunction with conventional antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) for the treatment of recurrence or an initial episode of c. difficile colitis in adults.  the studies were small in size and had methodological problems. a statistically significant benefit for probiotics combined with antibiotics was found in one study. mcfarland 1994 found that patients receiving s. boulardii were significantly less likely than patients receiving placebo to experience recurrence of c. difficile diarrhea (rr 0.59; 95% ci 0.35 to 0.98). no benefit of probiotics treatment was found in the other studies. authors' conclusions: there  is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for c. difficile colitis. there is no evidence to support the  use of probiotics alone in the treatment of c. difficile colitis.

TI  == clinical indications for probiotics: an overview.
AB  == probiotic bacteria are used to treat or prevent a broad range of human diseases,  conditions, and syndromes. in addition, there are areas of medical use that have  been proposed for future probiotic applications. randomized double-blind studies  have provided evidence of probiotic effectiveness for the treatment and prevention of acute diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, as well as for the  prevention of cow milk-induced food allergy in infants and young children. research studies have also provided evidence of effectiveness for the prevention  of traveler's diarrhea, relapsing clostridium difficile-induced colitis, and urinary tract infections. there are also studies indicating that probiotics may be useful for prevention of respiratory infections in children, dental caries, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. areas of future interest for the application of probiotics include colon and bladder cancers, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. the probiotics with the greatest number of proven benefits are lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and saccharomyces boulardii.

TI  == probiotics for clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: focus on lactobacillus  rhamnosus gg and saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the use of probiotics to treat or prevent  recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) by replacing normal gastric flora. data sources: pubmed (1970-march 2007) was searched using the terms probiotics, clostridium difficile, colitis, diarrhea, prevention, and treatment. study selection and data extraction: case reports, case series, and clinical trials describing the use of probiotics in the treatment or prevention of recurrences of cdad as primary outcome were included. data synthesis: a variety of controlled trials, case series, and case reports have evaluated probiotics to treat first or recurrent episodes of cdad. in addition, a meta-analysis has been conducted to try to determine the role of probiotics in cdad. in general, most case series and case reports have shown favorable results  with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or saccharomyces boulardii. however, other reports have shown lack of benefit. the meta-analysis showed that these probiotics may be useful in treating or preventing recurrences of cdad. nonetheless, the heterogeneity of the studies makes definite conclusions difficult. in addition, several cases of bacteremia or fungemia associated with probiotic use have been reported, particularly in the last decade. patients most  commonly affected by these complications are immunosuppressed. unfortunately, these are also the patients more likely to have severe cdad or are at risk for recurrences. conclusions: additional experience with and study of probiotics are  warranted due to numerous unanswered questions. given the potential for complications in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients, the risks may outweigh benefits, and rational antibiotic use may be a better option to prevent  a first episode or recurrence of cdad.

TI  == [therapeutic possibilities of probiotics in antibiotic-related diarrhea].
AB  == one of the major problems associated with the use of antibiotics is the occurrence of antibiotic-related diarrhea. although most such cases of diarrhea are harmless, in individual cases it may lead on to fulminant colitis. in 10-20%  of the patients, the causal factor is infection with clostridium difficile, which multiplies unhindered in patients on antibiotics. in the meantime, controlled, randomized studies have shown that probiotics can exercise a preventive effect in antibiotic-related diarrhea. the administration of saccharomyces boulardii or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg reduces the relative risk of an antibiotic-related diarrhea developing by 0.5. the data are more uniform in children than in adults.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == short communication: effect of exopolysaccharide isolated from "viili" on the adhesion of probiotics and pathogens to intestinal mucus.
AB  == the strong ropy character of the scandinavian fermented milk viili is conferred by the exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactococcal strains. these biopolymers can be responsible for some health benefits. we have assessed the influence of the eps fraction isolated from commercial viili on the adhesion of some probiotics and pathogens to human intestinal mucus. concentrations of viili  eps greater than 0.1 mg/ml promoted a decrease in adherence of bifidobacterium lactis bb12 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and this effect was dose-dependent. however, no modifications were detected on the adhesion levels of the pathogenic  strains tested at a concentration of 1 mg/ml of eps. results obtained in the present work should be considered in the design of new probiotic products.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == meta-analysis of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea  and the treatment of clostridium difficile disease.
AB  == context: antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) is a common complication of most antibiotics and clostridium difficile disease (cdd), which also is incited by antibiotics, is a leading cause of nosocomial outbreaks of diarrhea and colitis.  the use of probiotics for these two related diseases remains controversial. objective: to compare the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of aad and the treatment of cdd based on the published randomized, controlled clinical trials. data sources: pubmed, medline, google scholar, nih registry of clinical trials, metaregister, and cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched from 1977 to 2005, unrestricted by language. secondary searches of reference lists, authors, reviews, commentaries, associated diseases, books, and  meeting abstracts. study selection: trials were included in which specific probiotics given to either prevent or treat the diseases of interest. trials were required to be randomized, controlled, blinded efficacy trials in humans published in peer-reviewed journals. trials that were excluded were pre-clinical, safety, phase 1 studies in volunteers, reviews, duplicate reports, trials of unspecified probiotics, trials of prebiotics, not the disease being studied, or inconsistent outcome measures. thirty-one of 180 screened studies (totally 3,164  subjects) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. data extraction: one reviewer identified studies and abstracted data on sample size, population characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. data synthesis: from 25 randomized controlled trials (rcts), probiotics significantly reduced the relative risk of aad (rr = 0.43, 95% ci 0.31, 0.58, p < 0.001). from six randomized trials, probiotics had significant efficacy for cdd (rr = 0.59, 95% ci 0.41, 0.85, p = 0.005). conclusion: a variety of different types of probiotics show promise as effective therapies for these two diseases. using meta-analyses, three types of probiotics (saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, and probiotic mixtures) significantly reduced the development of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. only s. boulardii was effective for cdd.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile diarrhea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhea is a common clinical problem occurring in up to 25% of patients, with diarrhea owing to clostridium difficile accounting for up to a quarter of cases. the clinical and economic costs of antibiotic-associated diarrhea are significant and better treatments are needed. probiotics may offer potential effective therapy for antibiotic-associated diarrhea by restoring intestinal microbial balance. a number of different probiotics have been evaluated in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, including the nonpathogenic yeast saccharomyces boulardii and multiple lactic-acid fermenting bacteria such as lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg). a careful review of the literature supports the efficacy of s. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea recurrent c. difficile infection in adults, whereas lgg is useful in the treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. not enough data exist to currently support the use of other probiotic preparations in these conditions. although generally safe and well tolerated, both s. boulardii and lgg should be used cautiously in immunocompromised patients. further study of probiotics, including  large, well-designed, randomized controlled dose-ranging trials, comparative trials, and cost-benefit analyses are necessary.

TI  == tylosin-responsive chronic diarrhea in dogs.
AB  == fourteen dogs had shown chronic or intermittent diarrhea for more than 1 year. diarrhea had been successfully treated with tylosin for at least 6 months but recurred when treatment was withdrawn on at least 2 occasions. tylosin-responsive diarrhea (trd) affects typically middle-aged, large-breed dogs and clinical signs indicate that trd affects both the small and large intestine. treatment with tylosin eliminated diarrhea in all dogs within 3 days and in most dogs within 24  hours. tylosin administration controlled diarrhea in all dogs, but after it was discontinued, diarrhea reappeared in 12 (85.7%) of 14 dogs within 30 days. prednisone given for 3 days did not completely resolve diarrhea. probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg did not prevent the relapse of diarrhea in any of 9 dogs so treated. the etiology of trd, a likely form of antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ard) is unclear. the following reasons for chronic diarrhea were excluded or found to be unlikely: parasites, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, enteropathogenic bacteria (salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., yersinia spp., or lawsoni intracellularis), and clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and clostridium difficile a toxin. a possible etiologic factor is a specific enteropathogenic organism that is a common resident in the canine gastrointestinal tract and is sensitive to tylosin but difficult to eradicate. additional studies are required  to identify the specific cause of trd.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == probiotic agents and infectious diseases: a modern perspective on a traditional therapy.
AB  == there is an increasing scientific and commercial interest in the use of beneficial microorganisms, or "probiotics," for the prevention and treatment of disease. the microorganisms most frequently used as probiotic agents are lactic-acid bacteria such as lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), which has been extensively studied in recent literature. multiple mechanisms of action have been postulated, including lactose digestion, production of antimicrobial agents, competition for space or nutrients, and immunomodulation. we have reviewed recent studies of probiotics for the treatment and control of infectious diseases. studies of pediatric diarrhea show substantial evidence of clinical benefits from probiotic therapy in patients with viral gastroenteritis, and data on lgg treatment for clostridium difficile diarrhea appear promising. however, data to support use of probiotics for prevention of traveler's diarrhea are more limited. new research suggests potential applications in vaccine development and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. further studies are needed to take full advantage of this traditional medical approach and to apply it to the infectious diseases of the new millennium.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == protection from gastrointestinal diseases with the use of probiotics.
AB  == probiotics are nonpathogenic microorganisms that, when ingested, exert a positive influence on the health or physiology of the host. they can influence intestinal  physiology either directly or indirectly through modulation of the endogenous ecosystem or immune system. the results that have been shown with a sufficient level of proof to enable probiotics to be used as treatments for gastrointestinal disturbances are 1) the good tolerance of yogurt compared with milk in subjects with primary or secondary lactose maldigestion, 2) the use of saccharomyces boulardii and enterococcus faecium sf 68 to prevent or shorten the duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 3) the use of s. boulardii to prevent further recurrence of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and 4) the use of fermented milks containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg to shorten the duration of  diarrhea in infants with rotavirus enteritis (and probably also in gastroenteritis of other causes). effects that are otherwise suggested for diverse probiotics include alleviation of diarrhea of miscellaneous causes; prophylaxis of gastrointestinal infections, which includes traveler's diarrhea; and immunomodulation. trials of gastrointestinal diseases that involve the ecosystem are currently being performed, eg, helicobacter pylori infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.

TI  == probiotics and gastrointestinal health.
AB  == evidence for positive health benefits of lactobacilli applies to only a few strains used for commercial applications. it is generally agreed that a probiotic must be capable of colonizing the intestinal tract to influence human health; this requirement disqualifies many of the strains currently used in fermented dairy products. lactobacillus gg, a variant of l. casei sps rhamnosus, has been studied extensively in adults and children. when consumed as a dairy product or as a lyophilized powder, lgg colonizes the gastrointestinal tract for 1-3 days in most individuals and up to 7 days in about 30% of subjects. traveler's diarrhea,  antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and relapsing clostridium difficile colitis are improved with lgg. in infantile diarrhea, the severity and duration of the attack is reduced. lgg-fermented milk lessens the intestinal permeability defects caused by exposure to cows milk or rotavirus infection. lgg has proven beneficial effects on intestinal immunity. it increases the numbers of iga and other immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the intestinal mucosa. lgg stimulates local release of interferon. it facilitates antigen transport to underlying lymphoid cells, which serves to increase antigen uptake in peyer's patches. lgg also acts  as an immunoadjuvant for oral vaccines. in an animal model of colon cancer, lgg reduced the incidence of chemically induced tumors in the large bowel of rodents. extensive safety testing has shown no pathogenic potential in humans or animals.  probiotic cultures of lactobacilli have the potential to bring substantial health benefits to the consumer. the purported benefits for any probiotic must pass the  highest standards of scientific scrutiny before the claims can be accepted.

AB  == objectives: antimicrobial treatment may disturb the colonization resistance of gastrointestinal microflora, which may induce clinical symptoms, most commonly diarrhea. the severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhea may range from a brief,  self-limiting disease to devastating diarrhea with electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, crampy abdominal pain, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, or even death. the incidence of diarrhea in children receiving a single antimicrobial treatment is unclear. in addition to more critical use of antimicrobials, adjunctive preventive measures to antibiotic-associated diarrhea  are needed. the objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of diarrhea after antimicrobial treatment in children with no history of antimicrobial use during the previous 3 months. another aim of this study was to assess the preventive potential of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lactobacillus gg; american type culture collection 53103), a probiotic strain with a documented safety record and a therapeutic effect in viral gastroenteritis on antibiotic-associated diarrhea. methods: oral antimicrobial agents were prescribed for the treatment of acute respiratory infections at the clinics of the health care center of the city of tampere or tampere university hospital, finland, to 167 patients who were invited to participate in the study. of the patients, 48 were lost to follow-up;  therefore, the final study population consisted of 119 children from 2 weeks to 12. 8 years of age (mean: 4.5 years). all study subjects met the inclusion criteria: they had not received any antimicrobial medication during the previous  3 months, they did not suffer from gastrointestinal disorders, and they did not need intravenous antimicrobial treatment. the patients were randomized to receive placebo or 2 x 10(10) colony-forming units of lactobacillus gg in capsules given  twice daily during the antimicrobial treatment. lactobacillus gg and placebo capsules were indistinguishable in appearance and taste. the parents kept a daily symptom diary and recorded stool frequency and consistency at home for 3 months.  diarrhea was defined as at least three watery or loose stools per day for a minimum of 2 consecutive days. in the case of diarrhea, viral (adenovirus, rotavirus, calicivirus and astrovirus) and bacterial (salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter, clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, and yeasts) analyses were studied in fecal samples. the metabolic activity of the gut microflora was assessed by analysis of fecal urease, beta-glucosidase, and beta-glucuronidase activities. the primary outcome measure was diarrhea during the first 2 weeks after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment, because this period most likely reflects the effects of antimicrobial use. secondary outcome measures were the activities of fecal urease, beta-glucuronidase, and beta-glucosidase. results: on the entire follow-up, 80% of any gastrointestinal symptoms were reported during the first 2 weeks after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment. the incidence of diarrhea was 5% in the lactobacillus gg group and 16% in the placebo group within 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy (chi(2) = 3.82). the treatment effect (95% confidence interval) of lactobacillus  gg was -11% (-21%-0%). in diarrheal episodes, the viral and bacterial analyses were positive for clostridium difficile in 2 cases and for norwalk-like calicivirus in 3 cases. the age of the patients with diarrhea was between 3 months and 5 years in 75% of cases in both groups. the severity of diarrhea was comparable in the study groups, as evidenced by similar stool frequency (mean: 5  per day; range: 3-6) and the duration of diarrhea (mean: 4 days; range: 2-8). the activities of fecal urease and beta-glucuronidase, but not beta-glucosidase, changed significantly after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment in the lactobacillus gg group and in the placebo group alike.
