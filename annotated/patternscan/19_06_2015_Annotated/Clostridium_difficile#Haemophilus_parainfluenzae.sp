AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.
