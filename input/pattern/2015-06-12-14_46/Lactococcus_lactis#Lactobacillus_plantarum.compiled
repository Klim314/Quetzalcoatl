TI  - Codon and Propeptide Optimizations to Improve the Food-grade Expression of Bile Salt Hydrolase in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - To achieve the food-grade expression of bile salt hydrolase (BSH, EC 3.5.1.24) from Lactobacillus plantarum BBE7, the nisin controlled gene expression system (NICE), food-grade selection maker and signal peptide of Lactococcus lactis were used in this study. The open reading frame of BSH was optimized based on the codon bias of L. lactis, resulting in 12-fold and 9.5% increases in the intracellular and extracellular BSH activities, respectively. Three synthetic propeptides, LEISSTCDA (acidic), LGISSTCNA (neutral) and LKISSTCHA (basic) were also fused with signal peptide SPusp45 of vector pNZ8112 and introduced into the food-grade expression vector pNZ8149, respectively. Among these propeptides, acidic propeptide was effective in increasing the secretion efficiency and yield of BSH in recombinant bacteria, while neutral propeptide had no significant effect on the secretion of BSH. In contrast, basic propeptide strongly reduced the extracellular expression of BSH. By using codon optimization and the acidic propeptide together, the extracellular BSH activity was increased by 11.3%, reaching its maximum of 3.56 U/mg. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the intracellular and extracellular expression of BSH using food-grade expression system, which would lay a solid foundation for large-scale production of BSH and other heterologous proteins in L. lactis.
TI  - Physiological and transcriptional responses of different industrial microbes at near-zero specific growth rates.
AB  - Current knowledge of the physiology and gene expression of industrially relevant  microorganisms is largely based on laboratory studies under conditions of rapid growth and high metabolic activity. However, in natural ecosystems and industrial processes, microbes frequently encounter severe calorie restriction. As a consequence, microbial growth rates in such settings can be extremely slow and even approach zero. Furthermore, uncoupling microbial growth from product formation, while cellular integrity and activity are maintained, offers economically highly interesting perspectives. Retentostat cultures have been employed to investigate microbial physiology at (near-)zero growth rates. This minireview compares information from recent physiological and gene-expression studies on retentostat cultures of the industrially relevant microorganisms Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger. Shared responses of these organisms to (near-)zero growth rates include increased stress tolerance and a down-regulation of genes involved in protein synthesis. Other adaptations, such as changes in morphology and (secondary) metabolite production, were species-specific. This comparison underlines the industrial and scientific significance of further research on microbial (near-)zero growth physiology.
TI  - Dual color bioluminescence imaging for simultaneous monitoring of intestinal persistence of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis in living mice.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are found in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals and have  received tremendous attention due to their health-promoting properties. We report the development of two dual color luciferase-producing Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis for noninvasive simultaneous tracking in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We previously described the functional expression of the red luciferase mutant (CBRluc) from Pyrophorus plagiophtalamus in L. plantarum NCIMB8826 and L. lactis MG1363. In this study, we determined that CBRluc is a better performing luciferase for in vivo localization of both lactic acid bacteria after oral administration, as compared with the green click beetle luciferase mutant construct developed in this study. We furthermore established the possibility to simultaneously detect red and green emitting lactic acid bacteria by dual wavelength bioluminescence imaging in combination with spectral unmixing. The difference in spectra of light emission by the red and green click beetle luciferase mutants and dual bioluminescence detection allowed in vitro and in vivo quantification of the red and green emitted signals and thus monitoring the dynamics and fate of the two bacterial populations simultaneously. Persistence and viability of both strains simultaneously administered to mice in different ratios was studied in vivo in anesthetized mice and ex vivo in mouse feces. The application of dual-luciferase-labeled bacteria has considerable potential to simultaneous study the interactions and potential competitions of different targeted bacteria and their host.
TI  - Lactic acid microflora of the gut of snail .
AB  - The intestinal lactic acid microflora of the edible snail Cornu aspersum was studied by culture-based methods and was phenotypically and molecularly characterized. The antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates was investigated. Snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of Bulgaria. One hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of LAB, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. Representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. The snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by Enterococcus (17 isolates), Lactococcus (12 isolates), Leuconostoc (7 isolates), Lactobacillus (18 isolates) and Weissella (1 isolate). The species affiliation of Lactococcus lactis (12), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and Lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. The Lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence analysis of 16S rDNA as Lactobacillus brevis (12), L. plantarum (2), Lactobacillus graminis (1) and Lactobacillus curvatus (3). The species L. brevis, L. graminis and L. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas L. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. Antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of L. mesentereoides P4/8 against Propionibacterium acnes. The present study showed that the LAB are a component of the microbial communities in the snail digestive system. This is the first report on Lactobacillus strains detected in the gut of C. aspersum.
TI  - Three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to reach a stable ecosystem within seven days of natural bamboo shoot fermentation as revealed by different molecular approaches.
AB  - Microbial community structure and population dynamics during spontaneous bamboo shoot fermentation for production of 'soidon' (indigenous fermented food) in North East India were studied using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent molecular approaches. Cultivation-dependent analyzes (PCR amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and rRNA gene sequencing) and cultivation-independent analyzes (PCR-DGGE, qPCR and Illumina amplicon sequencing) were conducted on the time series samples collected from three independent indigenous soidon fermentation batches. The current findings revealed three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to attain a stable ecosystem within 7 days natural fermentation of bamboo shoots. Weissella spp. (Weissella cibaria, uncultured Weissella ghanensis) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris predominated the early phase (1 - 2 days) which was joined by Leuconostoc citreum during the mid phase (3 days), while Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum emerged and became dominant in the late phase (5 - 7 days) with concurrent disappearance of W. cibaria and L. lactis subsp. cremoris. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and uncultured Lactobacillus acetotolerans were predominantly present throughout the fermentation with no visible dynamics. The above identified dominant bacterial species along with their dynamics can be effectively utilized for designing a starter culture for industrialization of soidon production. Our results showed that a more realistic view on the microbial ecology of soidon fermentation could be obtained by cultivation-dependent studies complemented with cultivation-independent molecular approaches. Moreover, the critical issues to be considered for reducing methodological biases while studying the microbial ecology of traditional food fermentation were also highlighted with this soidon fermentation model.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of fermented soy milk with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis S-SU2 in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells and DSS-induced IBD model mice.
AB  - Six lactic acid bacteria strains (four Lactobacillus plantarum strains and one each of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Pediococcus pentosaceus) have been isolated and shown to possess anti-oxidant activity. In this study, we determined their acid, bile, salt resistance, and adhesion activity on human enterocyte-like HT-29-Luc and Caco-2 cells. An isolate Lc. lactis S-SU2 showed highest bile resistance and adhesion activity compared to type strains. S-SU2 could ferment both 10% skimmed milk and soy milk while the type strain could not ferment soy milk. Soy milk fermented with S-SU2 showed an increased nitric oxide (NO) secretion in the mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the fermented soy milk on Escherichia coli O111 LPS-induced NO secretion were higher than those of fresh soy milk. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was induced in mice fed either 5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water or 50% soy milk in drinking water. Shortening of colon length, breaking of epithelial cells, lowering liver and thymus weights, and enlargement of spleen are some of the characteristics observed in the IBD, which were prevented by the use of soy milk fermented with Lc. lactis S-SU2.
TI  - Construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pJY33 from Weissella cibaria 33.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid, pJY33, from Weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pJY33 was  2365 bp in size with a GC content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (ORFs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from W. cibaria KLC140. A Weissella-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pJY33E (6.5 kb, Em(r)), was constructed by ligation of pJY33 with pBluescript II SK(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (Em(r)). pJY33E replicated in Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Weissella confusa. A single-stranded DNA intermediate was detected from Lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pJY33E, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pJY33. Most Lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pJY33E after one week of daily culturing in MRS broth without Em. An aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in Lb. brevis 2.14 using pJY33E, and the highest level of alpha-Gal activity (36.13 U/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.
TI  - Characterization, identification and application of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  - There has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. This study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in China. One hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be LAB based on their Gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. These isolates were divided into eight groups (A-H) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. The Group A to H strains were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), L. casei (5.1%), Leuconostoc (Ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), Pediococcus (P.) pentosaceus (24.2%), Enterococcus (E.) mundtii (12.1%), Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae (15.2%), E. faecium (9.1%) and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16S rRNA and recA genes. P. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the LAB population in the paddy rice silage. A selected strain, namely L. casei R 465, was found to be able to grow under low pH conditions and to improve the silage quality with low pH and a relatively high content of lactic acid. This study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant LAB species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with LAB, and that strain R 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.
TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - Analysis of commercial kidney stone probiotic supplements.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the levels of Oxalobacter formigenes in probiotic supplements marketed by PRO-LAB, Ltd, Toronto, Canada, and capsules of Oxalo purchased from Sanzyme Ltd, Hyderabad, India, and to measure the ability of these preparations to degrade oxalate in vitro. METHODS: Probiotic supplements and pure cultures of O. formigenes were cultured in a number of media containing oxalate. Optical density at 595 nm (OD595) was used to measure bacterial growth, and ion chromatography was used to measure loss of oxalate in culture media. O. formigenes-specific and degenerate Lactobacillus primers to the oxalate decarboxylase gene (oxc) were used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Incubating probiotic supplements in different media did not result in the growth of oxalate-degrading organisms. PCR indicated the absence of organisms harboring the oxc gene. Culture and 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing indicated the PRO-LAB supplement contained viable Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (GenBank accession no. KJ095656.1), whereas Oxalo contained several Bacillus species and Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSION: The probiotic supplement sold over the Internet by PRO-LAB Ltd and Sanzyme Ltd did not contain identifiable O. formigenes or viable oxalate-degrading organisms, and they are unlikely to be of benefit to calcium oxalate kidney stone patients.
TI  - Fermentation Characteristics and Microbial Diversity of Tropical Grass-legumes Silages.
AB  - Calliandra calothyrsus preserved in silage is an alternative method for improving the crude protein content of feeds for sustainable ruminant production. The aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of silage which contained different levels of C. calothyrsus by examining the fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. Silage was made in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments with three replications i.e.: R0, Pennisetum purpureum 100%; R1, P. purpureum 75%+C. calothyrsus 25%;, R2, P. purpureum 50%+C. calothyrsus 50%; R3, P. purpureum 25%+C. calothyrsus 75%; and R4, C. calothyrsus 100%. All silages were prepared using plastic jar silos (600 g) and incubated at room temperature for 30 days. Silages were analyzed for fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. Increased levels of C. calothyrsus in silage had a significant effect (p<0.01) on the fermentation characteristics. The microbial diversity index decreased and activity was inhibited with increasing levels of C. calothyrsus. The microbial community indicated that there was a population of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Chryseobacterium sp., and uncultured bacteria. The result confirmed that silage with a combination of grass and C. calothyrsus had good fermentation characteristics and microbial communities were dominated by L. plantarum.
TI  - Pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from Northwestern Argentina.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from Northwestern Argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at Maimara (chicha M) and Tumbaya (chicha T). Whereas by culture-dependent approach a few number of species (Lactobacillus plantarum and Weissella viridescens in chicha M, and Enterococcus faecium and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha T) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. The relative abundance of OTUs was higher in chicha M than in chicha T; six LAB genera were common for chicha M and T: Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus while Pediococcus only was detected in chicha M. Among the 46 identified LAB species, those of Lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas Enterococcus and Leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha T and M, respectively. Identification at species level showed the predominance of Lb. plantarum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Leuconostoc lactis and W. viridescens in chicha M while Enterococcus hirae, E. faecium, Lc. mesenteroides and Weissella confusa predominated in chicha T samples. In parallel, when presumptive LAB isolates (chicha M: 146; chicha T: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by ISR-PCR and RAPD-PCR profiles, species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the Leuconostoc genus (Lc. mesenteroides and Lc. lactis) in chicha M, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus being also present. In contrast, chicha T exhibited the presence of Enterococcus and Leuconostoc, E. faecium being the most representative species. Massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. Although differences in the LAB species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant LAB species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. The fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on LAB population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria from traditional cheese in Khorramabad city of Iran with probiotic potential.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with proteolitic activity are used as aromatic and antibacterial substances, cholesterol reduces, bile salt hydrolyses, and probiotic. The aims of this project were to isolate and identify natural LAB flora involved in traditional fermentation in cheeses of Khoramabad city and also to survey their probiotic potential. In order to achieve this goal, LAB were isolated and characterized using phenotypic and genotypic methods (PCR-sequencing); in the next stage, they were analyzed lowering cholesterol medium, hydrolysis of the bile, resistance to bile-resistant PH acidic stomach. At the end of the study, 88 cocci and 3 bacill were found: 58 Enterococcus faecium, 16 Enterococcus hirae, 5 Lactococcus lactis, 3 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 9 undetermined. The probiotic results of the bacteria had effects on the reduction of cholesterol, resistance to stomach acid, had relative antibacterial effects, and some strains had effects on hydrolyzing the bile. For further identification, the PCR method and the application of 16s-DNA-ITS genes and its sequencing were found useful. This study showed that lactic acid bacteria in the traditional cheese of the Khorramabad city have relative probiotic effect and that these lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk are suitable.
TI  - The effects of combined dietary probiotics Lactococcus lactis BFE920 and Lactobacillus plantarum FGL0001 on innate immunity and disease resistance in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).
AB  - The effects of a dietary probiotic mixture containing Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis BFE920 isolated from bean sprout and autochthonous Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum FGL0001 originally isolated from the hindgut of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) were investigated for the purpose of improving the probiotic effects of Lc. lactis BFE920 on the olive flounder. The immunostimulatory, disease protective, and weight gain effects of Lc. lactis BFE920 were significantly improved when olive flounder (average weight 37.5+/-1.26 g) were fed the probiotic mixture (log10 7.0 CFU each/g feed pellet) for 30 days. Flounder fed the mixture showed improved skin mucus lysozyme activity and phagocytic activity of innate immune cells compared to flounder fed a single probiotic agent or a control diet. While the levels of neutrophil activity in flounder fed the single probiotic agent or the mixture were similar, they were significantly higher than levels in a control group. Additionally, probiotic-fed flounder showed significantly increased expressions of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in the intestine compared to the control group. Following a 30-day period of being fed probiotics or a control diet, the olive flounder were challenged with an i.p. injection of Streptococcus iniae (log10 6.0 CFU/fish). The groups fed the mixed probiotics, Lc. lactis BFE920, Lb. plantarum FGL0001, and the control diet had survival rates of 55%, 45%, 35%, and 20%, respectively. Flounder fed the probiotic mixture gained 38.1+/-2.8% more body weight compared to flounder fed the control diet during the 30-day study period. These data strongly suggest that a mixture of Lc. lactis BFE920 and Lb. plantarum FGL0001 may serve as an immunostimulating feed additive useful for disease protection in the fish farming industry.
TI  - Different effects of two newly-isolated probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 15HN and Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis 44Lac strains from traditional dairy products on cancer cell lines.
AB  - Lactobacillus and Lactococcus strains isolated from food products can be introduced as probiotics because of their health-promoting characteristics and non-pathogenic nature. This study aims to perform the isolation, molecular identification, and probiotic characterization of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus strains from traditional Iranian dairy products. Primary probiotic assessments indicated high tolerance to low pH and high bile salt conditions, high anti-pathogenic activities, and susceptibility to high consumption antibiotics, thus proving that both strains possess probiotic potential. Cytotoxicity assessments were used to analyze the effects of the secreted metabolite on different cancer cell lines, including HT29, AGS, MCF-7, and HeLa, as well as a normal human cell line (HUVEC). Results showed acceptable cytotoxic properties for secreted metabolites (40 mug/ml dry weight) of Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis 44Lac. Such performance was similar to that of Taxol against all of the treated cancer cell lines; however, the strain exhibited no toxicity on the normal cell line. Cytotoxic assessments through flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated that apoptosis is the main cytotoxic mechanism for secreted metabolites of L. lactis subsp. Lactis 44Lac. By contrast, the effects of protease-treated metabolites on the AGS cell line verified the protein nature of anti-cancer metabolites. However, precise characterizations and in vitro/in vivo investigations on purified proteins should be conducted before these metabolites are introduced as potential anti-cancer therapeutics.
TI  - Effect of autochthonous starter cultures on the biogenic amine content of ewe's milk cheese throughout ripening.
AB  - Cheese is among the most commonly implicated foods associated with biogenic amines poisoning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the type of autochthonous starter culture and ripening time on the concentration of biogenic amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine, cadaverine, tryptamine, beta-phenylethylamine, spermine and spermidine) in cheeses made from pasteurized ewe's milk. 4 cheese batches were made, in duplicate, and ripened for 7 months. The biogenic amines of 40 cheeses were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The predominant biogenic amines determined at the end of the ripening time were phenylethylamine, spermine and tryptamine. Together, these accounted for 81% of the total of biogenic amines studied. The type of starter culture used to make the ewe's cheese had a significant effect (p < 0.001) on the content of biogenic amines throughout ripening time. It was lower in the batches made with an autochthonous starter culture made up entirely of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris or of the same in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum.
TI  - Effects of Ensiling Fermentation and Aerobic Deterioration on the Bacterial Community in Italian Ryegrass, Guinea Grass, and Whole-crop Maize Silages Stored at High Moisture Content.
AB  - The effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in Italian ryegrass (IR), guinea grass (GG), and whole-crop maize (WM) silages. Direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-Butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the IR, GG, and WM silages, respectively. The acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of GG ensiling. Pantoea agglomerans, Rahnella aquatilis, and Enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the IR silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. Staphylococcus sciuri and Bacillus pumilus were detected when IR silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community at silo opening. Lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the GG silage. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. Enterobacter cloacae appeared when the GG silage was spoiled. In the WM silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. Throughout the ensiling, Weissella paramesenteroides, Weissella confusa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. lactis. Upon deterioration, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Bacillus gibsonii were detected. These results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling and aerobic spoilage of IR, GG, and WM silages.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of some lactic Acid bacteria isolated from bee pollen: a preliminary study.
AB  - In the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. All isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. They were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. Using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (UPGMA), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. The following species were characterized: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. Phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus ingluviei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus acidipiscis and Weissella cibaria. The molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of BH0900 and AH3133.
TI  - Probiotic assessment of Enterococcus durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL isolated from vaginal microflora.
AB  - Forty-five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16S rDNA genes. Among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low pH, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. Lactococcus lactis 2HL, Enterococcus durans 6HL, Lactobacillus acidophilus 36YL and Lactobacillus plantarum 5BL showed the best resistance to these conditions. These strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Lactococcus lactis 2HL and E. durans 6HL were the most adherent strains. In vitro tests under neutralized pH proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. Results revealed that the growth of Escherichia coli O26, Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella flexneri was suppressed by both LAB strains. The antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. These data suggest that E. durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed as new probiotics.
TI  - Construction of a novel inducible expression vector for Lactococcus lactis M4 and Lactobacillus plantarum Pa21.
AB  - A vector that drives the expression of the reporter gusA gene in both Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis was constructed in this study. This vector contained a newly characterized heat shock promoter (Phsp), amplified from an Enterococcus faecium plasmid, pAR6. Functionality and characterization of this promoter was initially performed by cloning Phsp into pNZ8008, a commercial lactococcal plasmid used for screening of putative promoters which utilizes gusA as a reporter. It was observed that Phsp was induced under heat, salinity and alkaline stresses or a combination of all three stresses. The newly characterized Phsp promoter was then used to construct a novel Lactobacillus vector, pAR1801 and its ability to express the gusA under stress-induced conditions was reproducible in both Lb. plantarum Pa21 and L. lactis M4 hosts.
TI  - Characterization of some bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented foods.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from different sources (dairy products, fruits, fresh and fermented vegetables, fermented cereals) were screened for antimicrobial activity against other bacteria, including potential pathogens and food spoiling bacteria. Six strains have been shown to produce bacteriocins: Lactococcus lactis 19.3, Lactobacillus plantarum 26.1, Enterococcus durans 41.2, isolated from dairy products and Lactobacillus amylolyticus P40 and P50, and Lactobacillus oris P49, isolated from bors. Among the six bacteriocins, there were both heat stable, low molecular mass polypeptides, with a broad inhibitory spectrum, probably belonging to class II bacteriocins, and heat labile, high molecular mass proteins, with a very narrow inhibitory spectrum, most probably belonging to class III bacteriocins. A synergistic effect of some bacteriocins mixtures was observed. We can conclude that fermented foods are still important sources of new functional LAB. Among the six characterized bacteriocins, there might be some novel compounds with interesting features. Moreover, the bacteriocin-producing strains isolated in our study may find applications as protective cultures.
TI  - Heterologous protein secretion in lactobacilli with modified pSIP vectors.
AB  - We describe new variants of the modular pSIP-vectors for inducible gene expression and protein secretion in lactobacilli. The basic functionality of the pSIP system was tested in Lactobacillus strains representing 14 species using pSIP411, which harbors the broad-host-range Lactococcus lactis SH71rep replicon and a beta-glucuronidase encoding reporter gene. In 10 species, the inducible gene expression system was functional. Based on these results, three pSIP vectors with different signal peptides were modified by replacing their narrow-host-range L. plantarum 256rep replicon with SH71rep and transformed into strains of five different species of Lactobacillus. All recombinant strains secreted the target protein NucA, albeit with varying production levels and secretion efficiencies. The Lp_3050 derived signal peptide generally resulted in the highest levels of secreted NucA. These modified pSIP vectors are useful tools for engineering a wide variety of Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in Malaysia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. Probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. Probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other LAB species. The aim of this study was to identify the LAB species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in LAB of broiler chicken. METHODS: Sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in Klang Valley of Malaysia for the isolation of LAB using de-Mann Rogosa Sharpe medium. Thirteen species of LAB were obtained in this study and the identification of LAB was performed by using API test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. Antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of LAB antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. Lactobacillus paracasei was the second common LAB species isolated from chicken faecal. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and Pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. Most of the isolated LAB was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the LAB against 15 types of antibiotics. Penicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (P< 0.05) inhibitory zone than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Many species of LAB were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. The development of resistant against antibiotics in LAB can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. Thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. Additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding also needs more attention and close monitoring.
TI  - Characterization and in vitro probiotic evaluation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from idli batter.
AB  - An Indian traditional fermented food, idli batter, was used as a source for isolation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). A total of 15 LAB strains were isolated on the basis of their Gram nature and catalase activity. Of these, one lactobacilli strain and one lactococci strain which showed antimicrobial activity were identified using biochemical characterization, sugar utilization and molecular sequencing. The microbes, labeled as IB-1 (Lactobacillus plantarum) and IB-2 (Lactococcus lactis) were tested for their in vitro tolerance to bile salts, resistance to low pH values and acidifying activity. Both the strains showed good viability (IB1- 58.11%; IB2- 60.84%) when exposed to high bile salt concentration (2%) and acidic pH of </=pH 3.0 (IB1- 88.13%; IB2- 89.85%). Lactic acid (IB1- 181.93 mM; IB2- 154.44 mM), biomass production (IB1- 0.65; IB2- 0.58 g/l) after 54 h as well as qualitative estimation of beta-galactosidase and vitamin B12 production were also studied to check their suitability as an industrially important strain for production of important biomolecules.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from lactic acid bacteria inhibit proliferation of the influenza A virus.
AB  - We isolated Lactobacillus plantarum LBP-K10 from the traditional Korean fermented food kimchi. When organic acids were removed, the culture filtrate of this isolate showed high antiviral activity (measured using a plaque-forming assay) against the influenza A (H3N2) virus. Two fractions that were active against influenza A virus were purified from the culture filtrate using a C18 column with high-performance liquid chromatography. These active fractions were crystallized and identified to be the cyclic dipeptides cis-cyclo (L-Leu-L-Pro) and cis-cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; this identification was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. These cyclic dipeptides were identified in the culture filtrate of other lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Weissella spp., and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Structure, biochemical characterization and analysis of the pleomorphism of carboxylesterase Cest-2923 from Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.
AB  - The hydrolase fold is one of the most versatile structures in the protein realm according to the diversity of sequences adopting such a three-dimensional architecture. In the present study, we clarified the crystal structure of the carboxylesterase Cest-2923 from the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 refined to 2.1 A resolution, determined its main biochemical characteristics and also carried out an analysis of its associative behaviour in solution. We found that the versatility of a canonical alpha/beta hydrolase fold, the basic framework of the crystal structure of Cest-2923, also extends to its oligomeric behaviour in solution. Thus, we discovered that Cest-2923 exhibits a pH-dependent pleomorphic behaviour in solution involving monomers, canonical dimers and tetramers. Although, at neutral pH, the system is mainly shifted to dimeric species, under acidic conditions, tetrameric species predominate. Despite these tetramers resulting from the association of canonical dimers, as is commonly found in many other carboxylesterases from the hormone-sensitive lipase family, they can be defined as 'noncanonical' because they represent a different association mode. We identified this same type of tetramer in the closest relative of Cest-2923 that has been structurally characterized: the sugar hydrolase YeeB from Lactococcus lactis. The observed associative behaviour is consistent with the different crystallographic results for Cest-2923 from structural genomics consortia. Finally, the presence of sulfate or acetate molecules (depending on the crystal form analysed) in the close vicinity of the nucleophile Ser116 allows us to identify interactions with the putative oxyanion hole and deduce the existence of hydrolytic activity within Cest-2923 crystals.
TI  - Survival and beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria from raniculture subjected to freeze-drying and storage.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of freeze-drying and storage conditions on the viability and beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for raniculture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactococcus lactis CRL 1584, L. lactis CRL 1827, Lactococcus garvieae CRL 1828 and Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 1606 viability under different conditions was studied. 10% lactose and 5% skim milk + 5% lactose were excellent lyoprotectants, but 5% skim milk + 5% lactose and whey protein concentrated (WPC) or WPC + sugars were the lower cost lyoprotective options. The effect of temperature depended on both lyoprotectants and storage time. Thus, for Lactococcus, skim milk, skim milk + sucrose and WPC + sucrose were selected for lyophilization and storage at 4 degrees C and skim milk + lactose for 25 degrees C. For Lact. plantarum CRL 1606, the best lyoprotectants for lyophilization and storage at 4 degrees C were milk + sugars and WPS + sucrose and, at 25 degrees C, skim milk + sucrose. CONCLUSIONS: Lactic acid bacteria viability after freeze-drying was strain-specific and depended on the lyoprotectant used. Highest viability was obtained when stored at 4 degrees C, and the beneficial properties remained stable for 18 months independently of storage temperature. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The studies reported for the first time in this work are of primary interest to obtain dried bacteria to be included in beneficial products for raniculture.
TI  - Genetic engineering techniques for lactic acid bacteria: construction of a stable shuttle vector and expression vector for beta-glucuronidase.
AB  - The shuttle vector, pUL6erm, was constructed by using a replicon from pL2, a multiple cloning site, colE1 ori, the ori of Gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the erythromycin resistance gene from pVA838 as a selection marker. pUL6erm could be transformed easily and maintained stably in Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei. Transformation assays of pUL6erm indicated that it had a narrow host range. beta-Glucuronidase was induced in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl and 50 mM glutamate and expressed at 2.4 U mg(-1) with the expression vector (pUL6erm-gadR-GUS) constructed based on pUL6erm carrying beta-glucuronidase gene wuth a chloride-inducible (gadR) expression cassette using Pgad as promoter. Therefore, pUL6erm and pUL6erm-gadR-GUS might be a safe and useful genetic tool for the improvement of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Microbial ecology dynamics during rye and wheat sourdough preparation.
AB  - The bacterial ecology during rye and wheat sourdough preparation was described by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Viable plate counts of presumptive lactic acid bacteria, the ratio between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, the rate of acidification, a permutation analysis based on biochemical and microbial features, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and diversity indices all together demonstrated the maturity of the sourdoughs during 5 to 7 days of propagation. Flours were mainly contaminated by metabolically active genera (Acinetobacter, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Comamonas, Enterobacter, Erwinia, and Sphingomonas) belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria or Bacteroidetes (genus Chryseobacterium). Their relative abundances varied with the flour. Soon after 1 day of propagation, this population was almost completely inhibited except for the Enterobacteriaceae. Although members of the phylum Firmicutes were present at very low or intermediate relative abundances in the flours, they became dominant soon after 1 day of propagation. Lactic acid bacteria were almost exclusively representative of the Firmicutes by this time. Weissella spp. were already dominant in rye flour and stably persisted, though they were later flanked by the Lactobacillus sakei group. There was a succession of species during 10 days of propagation of wheat sourdoughs. The fluctuation between dominating and subdominating populations of L. sakei group, Leuconostoc spp., Weissella spp., and Lactococcus lactis was demonstrated. Other subdominant species such as Lactobacillus plantarum were detectable throughout propagation. As shown by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae dominated throughout the sourdough propagation. Notwithstanding variations due to environmental and technology determinants, the results of this study represent a clear example of how the microbial ecology evolves during sourdough preparation.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of Serbia and lowland regions of Croatia.
AB  - The goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (BG) and nine fresh soft (ZG) artisanal cheeses collected in Serbia and Croatia. While LAB were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all BG cheeses but only in three ZG cheese samples. High LAB and yeast species diversity was determined (average H'(L)=0.4 and H'(Y)=0.8, respectively). The predominant LAB species in white pickled (BG) cheeses were Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (ZG) cheeses the most dominant LAB species were L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. Among the 20 yeast species found, Debaryomyces hansenii, Candida zeylanoides, and Torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in BG cheeses, while Yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in ZG cheeses. The characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of LAB isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of LAB strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic or proteolytic activity. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of LAB and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. The knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific LAB and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.
TI  - Organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase (PYK) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. Lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of PYK in their metabolism. These organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. They include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of PYK by inorganic phosphate, the activation of PYK shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. System-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. These require knowledge of the identities of the enzyme modifiers. Here, we predict potential allosteric activators of PYKs from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. We used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of PYK. Specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. We then made a kinetic model of Lactococcus lactis PYK to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. This strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the Enterococcus faecalis PYK, and to predict that the PYKs from Streptococcus pyogenes and Lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. These differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. The combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.
TI  - An extracellular Serine/Threonine-rich protein from Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826 is a novel aggregation-promoting factor with affinity to mucin.
AB  - Autoaggregation in lactic acid bacteria is directly related to the production of  certain extracellular proteins, notably, aggregation-promoting factors (APFs). Production of aggregation-promoting factors confers beneficial traits to probiotic-producing strains, contributing to their fitness for the intestinal environment. Furthermore, coaggregation with pathogens has been proposed to be a beneficial mechanism in probiotic lactic acid bacteria. This mechanism would limit attachment of the pathogen to the gut mucosa, favoring its removal by the human immune system. In the present paper, we have characterized a novel aggregation-promoting factor in Lactobacillus plantarum. A mutant with a knockout of the D1 gene showed loss of its autoaggregative phenotype and a decreased ability to bind to mucin, indicating an adhesion role of this protein. In addition, heterologous production of the D1 protein or an internal fragment of the protein, characterized by its abundance in serine/threonine, strongly induced autoaggregation in Lactococcus lactis. This result strongly suggested that this internal fragment is responsible for the bioactivity of D1 as an APF. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a gene coding for an aggregation-promoting factor in Lb. plantarum.
TI  - Cloning and heterologous expression of plnE, -F, -J and -K genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  - Plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plnE, -F, -J and -K structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. These amplicons were cloned and expressed in pET32a (+) vector in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). PlnE, -F, -J and -K peptides were expressed as His-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by Ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. The peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. The cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against Listeria innocua NRRL B33314, Micrococcus luteus MTCC 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as Enterococcus casseliflavus NRRL B3502, Lactococcus lactis lactis NRRL 1821, Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B4562 and Lactobacillus plantarum NRRL B4496. E. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. Heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.
TI  - Metagenome analyses reveal the influence of the inoculant Lactobacillus buchneri  CD034 on the microbial community involved in grass ensiling.
AB  - Silage is green fodder conserved by lactic acid fermentation performed by epiphytic lactic acid bacteria under anaerobic conditions. To improve the ensiling process and the quality of the resulting silage, starter cultures are added to the fresh forage. A detailed analysis of the microbial community playing a role in grass ensiling has been carried out by high throughput sequencing technologies. Moreover, the influence of the inoculant Lactobacillus buchneri CD034 on the microbial community composition was studied. For this purpose, grass was ensiled untreated or inoculated with L. buchneri CD034. The fresh forage as well as silages after 14 and 58 days of fermentation were characterized physico-chemically. Characteristic silage conditions such as increased titers of lactic acid bacteria and higher concentrations of acetic acid were observed in the inoculated silage in comparison to the untreated samples. Taxonomic community profiles deduced from 16S rDNA amplicon sequences indicated that the relative abundance of Lactococci diminished in the course of fermentations and that the proportion of bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased during the fermentation of untreated silage. In the inoculated silage, members of these phyla were repressed due to an increased abundance of Lactobacilli. In addition, metagenome analyses of silage samples confirmed taxonomic profiles based on 16S rDNA amplicons. Moreover, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactococcus lactis were found to be dominant species within silages as analyzed by means of fragment recruitments of metagenomic sequence reads on complete reference genome sequences. Fragment recruitments also provided clear evidence for the competitiveness of the inoculant strain L. buchneri CD034 during the fermentation of the inoculated silage. The inoculation strain was able to outcompete other community members and also affected physico-chemical characteristics of the silage.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbial community, acidity and proximate composition of akamu, a fermented maize food.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Akamu is a lactic acid-fermented cereal-based food that constitutes a major infant complementary food in most West African countries. The identities of LAB populations from DGGE analysis and conventionally isolated LAB and yeasts from traditionally fermented akamu were confirmed by PCR sequencing analysis. The relationships between pH, acidity and lactic acid levels and proximate composition of the akamu samples were investigated. RESULTS: The LAB communities in the akamu samples comprised mainly Lactobacillus species, including Lb. fermentum, Lb. plantarum, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Lb. helveticus, as well as Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. Identified yeasts were Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Clavispora lusitaniae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. Low pH (3.22-3.95) was accompanied by high lactic acid concentrations (43.10-84.29 mmol kg(-)(1)). Protein (31.88-74.32 g kg(-)(1)) and lipid (17.74-36.83 g kg(-)(1) contents were negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (897.48-926.20 g kg(-)(1), of which </=1 g kg(-)(1) was sugars). Ash was either not detected or present only in trace amounts (</=4 g kg(-)(1)). Energy levels ranged from 17.29 to 18.37 kJ g(-)(1). CONCLUSION: The akamu samples were predominantly starchy foods and had pH < 4.0 owing to the activities of fermentative LAB.
TI  - O-glycosylation as a novel control mechanism of peptidoglycan hydrolase activity.
AB  - Acm2, the major autolysin of Lactobacillus plantarum, is a tripartite protein. Its catalytic domain is surrounded by an O-glycosylated N-terminal region rich in Ala, Ser, and Thr (AST domain), which is of low complexity and unknown function, and a C-terminal region composed of five SH3b peptidoglycan (PG) binding domains. Here, we investigate the contribution of these two accessory domains and of O-glycosylation to Acm2 functionality. We demonstrate that Acm2 is an N-acetylglucosaminidase and identify the pattern of O-glycosylation (21 mono-N-acetylglucosamines) of its AST domain. The O-glycosylation process is species-specific as Acm2 purified from Lactococcus lactis is not glycosylated. We therefore explored the functional role of O-glycosylation by purifying different truncated versions of Acm2 that were either glycosylated or non-glycosylated. We show that SH3b domains are able to bind PG and are responsible for Acm2 targeting to the septum of dividing cells, whereas the AST domain and its O-glycosylation are not involved in this process. Notably, our data reveal that the lack of O-glycosylation of the AST domain significantly increases Acm2 enzymatic activity, whereas removal of SH3b PG binding domains dramatically reduces this activity. Based on this antagonistic role, we propose a model in which access of the Acm2 catalytic domain to its substrate may be hindered by the AST domain where O-glycosylation changes its conformation and/or mediates interdomain interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that O-glycosylation is shown to control the activity of a bacterial enzyme.
TI  - Regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) display differences in their regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. We combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), phosphate (Pi), and ionic strength (NaCl concentration) on six LDHs from four LABs studied at pH 6 and pH 7. We found that 1) the extent of activation by FBP (Kact) differs. Lactobacillus plantarum LDH is not regulated by FBP, but the other LDHs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: Enterococcus faecalis LDH2 </= Lactococcus lactis LDH2 < E. faecalis LDH1 < L. lactis LDH1 </= Streptococcus pyogenes LDH. This trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the LDH enzymes. 2) For L. plantarum, S. pyogenes, and E. faecalis, the effects of Pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding NaCl. 3) Addition of Pi inhibits E. faecalis LDH2, whereas in the absence of FBP, Pi is an activator of S. pyogenes LDH, E. faecalis LDH1, and L. lactis LDH1 and LDH2 at pH 6. These effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of Pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to pH 6 and pH 7. Overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of Pi, FBP, and pH that results in different regulatory effects on the LDHs of different LABs.
TI  - Utilization of lactic acid bacterial genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in the production of lactic acid.
AB  - Metabolic pathway engineering of cyanobacteria for the production of industrially important chemicals from atmospheric CO2 has generated interest recently. Here, we engineered Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to produce lactic acid using a lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) gene from various lactic acid-producing bacteria, Lactococcus lactis (ldhB and ldhX), Lactobacillus plantarum (ldhL and ldh), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ldhL). The lactic acid was secreted outside the cell using a transporter (lldp) gene from L. plantarum. Expression of each ldh in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was ascertained by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Five transformants led to the production of L-lactic acid. Co-expression of lldp with ldhB from L. plantarum or ldhL from L. rhamnosus led to the secretion of lactic acid into the medium at concentration of 0.17 +/- 0.02 or 0.14 +/- 0.02 mM after 18 d of cultivation.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria convert glucosinolates to nitriles efficiently yet differently from enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Glucosinolates from the genus Brassica can be converted into bioactive compounds  known to induce phase II enzymes, which may decrease the risk of cancers. Conversion via hydrolysis is usually by the brassica enzyme myrosinase, which can be inactivated by cooking or storage. We examined the potential of three beneficial bacteria, Lactobacillus plantarum KW30, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis KF147, and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, and known myrosinase-producer Enterobacter cloacae to catalyze the conversion of glucosinolates in broccoli extract. Enterobacteriaceae consumed on average 65% glucoiberin and 78% glucoraphanin, transforming them into glucoiberverin and glucoerucin, respectively, and small amounts of iberverin nitrile and erucin nitrile. The lactic acid bacteria did not accumulate reduced glucosinolates, consuming all at 30-33% and transforming these into iberverin nitrile, erucin nitrile, sulforaphane nitrile, and further unidentified metabolites. Adding beneficial bacteria to a glucosinolate-rich diet may increase glucosinolate transformation, thereby increasing host exposure to bioactives.
TI  - Evaluation of the food grade expression systems NICE and pSIP for the production  of 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase from Corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  - 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase (2,5-DKG reductase) catalyses the reduction  of 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid (2,5-DKG) to 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG), a direct precursor (lactone) of L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C). This reaction is an essential step in the biocatalytic production of the food supplement vitamin C from D-glucose or D-gluconic acid. As 2,5-DKG reductase is usually produced recombinantly, it is of interest to establish an efficient process for 2,5-DKG reductase production that also satisfies food safety requirements. In the present study, three recently described food grade variants of the Lactobacillales based expression systems pSIP (Lactobacillus plantarum) and NICE (Lactococcus lactis) were evaluated with regard to their effictiveness to produce 2,5-DKG reductase from Corynebacterium glutamicum. Our results indicate that both systems are suitable for 2,5-DKG reductase expression. Maximum production yields were obtained with Lb. plantarum/pSIP609 by pH control at 6.5. With 262 U per litre of broth, this represents the highest heterologous expression level so far reported for 2,5-DKG reductase from C. glutamicum. Accordingly, Lb. plantarum/pSIP609 might be an interesting alternative to Escherichia coli expression systems for industrial 2,5-DKG reductase production.
TI  - Kefir-isolated Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis inhibits the cytotoxic effect of  Clostridium difficile in vitro.
AB  - Kefir is a dairy product obtained by fermentation of milk with a complex microbial population and several health-promoting properties have been attributed to its consumption. In this work, we tested the ability of different kefir-isolated bacterial and yeast strains (Lactobacillus kefir, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subps. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces marxianus) or a mixture of them (MM) to antagonise the cytopathic effect of toxins from Clostridium difficile (TcdA and TcdB). Cell detachment assays and F-actin network staining using Vero cell line were performed. Although incubation with microbial cells did not reduce the damage induced by C. difficile spent culture supernatant (SCS), Lc. lactis CIDCA 8221 and MM supernatants were able to inhibit the cytotoxicity of SCS to Vero cells. Fraction of Lc. lactis CIDCA 8221 supernatant containing components higher than 10 kDa were responsible for the inhibitory activity and heating of this fraction for 15 min at 100 degrees C completely abrogated this ability. By dot-blot assay with anti-TcdA or anti-TcdB antibodies, concentration of both toxins seems to be reduced in SCS treated with Lc. lactis CIDCA 8221 supernatant. However, protective effect was not affected by treatment with proteases or proteases-inhibitors tested. In conclusion, we demonstrated that kefir-isolated Lc. lactis CIDCA 8221 secreted heat-sensitive products able to protect eukaryotic cells from cytopathic effect of C. difficile toxins in vitro. Our findings provide new insights into the probiotic action of microorganisms isolated from kefir against virulence factors from intestinal pathogens.
TI  - Bioluminescence imaging study of spatial and temporal persistence of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis in living mice.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacilli, are common inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of mammals, for which they have received considerable attention due to their putative health-promoting properties. In this study, we describe the development and application of luciferase-expressing Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis strains for noninvasive in vivo monitoring in the digestive tract of mice. We report for the first time the functional in vitro expression in Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 and in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 of the click beetle luciferase (CBluc), as well as Gaussia and bacterial luciferases, using a combination of vectors, promoters, and codon-optimized genes. We demonstrate that a CBluc construction is the best-performing luciferase system for the noninvasive in vivo detection of lactic acid bacteria after oral administration. The persistence and viability of both strains was studied by bioluminescence imaging in anesthetized mice and in mouse feces. In vivo bioluminescence imaging confirmed that after a single or multiple oral administrations, L. lactis has shorter survival times in the mouse gastrointestinal tract than L. plantarum, and it also revealed the precise gut compartments where both strains persisted. The application of luciferase-labeled bacteria has significant potential to allow the in vivo and ex vivo study of the interactions of lactic acid bacteria with their mammalian host.
TI  - Isolation of Pediococcus acidilactici Kp10 with ability to secrete bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from milk products for applications in food industry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can be isolated from traditional milk products. LAB that secrete substances that inhibit pathogenic bacteria and are resistant to acid, bile, and pepsin but not vancomycin may have potential in food applications. RESULTS: LAB isolated from a range of traditional fermented products were screened for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. A total of 222 LAB strains were isolated from fermented milk products in the form of fresh curds, dried curds, and ghara (a traditional flavor enhancer prepared from whey), and fermented cocoa bean. Eleven LAB isolates that produced antimicrobial substances were identified as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus acidilactici strains by biochemical methods and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Of these, the cell-free supernatant of Kp10 (P. acidilactici) most strongly inhibited Listeria monocytogenes. Further analysis identified the antimicrobial substance produced by Kp10 as proteinaceous in nature and active over a wide pH range. Kp10 (P. acidilactici) was found to be catalase-negative, able to produce beta-galactosidase, resistant to bile salts (0.3%) and acidic conditions (pH 3), and susceptible to most antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Traditionally prepared fermented milk products are good sources of LAB with characteristics suitable for industrial applications. The isolate Kp10 (P. acidilactici) shows potential for the production of probiotic and functional foods.
TI  - The dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of Obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - Obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from Uganda namely: Obutoko, Enturire, Ekitiribita and Obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. Knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. Culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and mixed DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified ribosomal RNA genes were used to study the bacteria and yeast diversity of Obushera. The pH dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire whereas that of Ekitiribita decreased to 4.4 after 4 days. Counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. LAB and yeast isolates were identified by rRNA gene sequence analysis. LAB isolates included: Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus (S.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weisella (W.) confusa. DGGE indicated predominance of S. gallolyticus, S. infantarius subsp. infantarius, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, W. confusa, Lb. reuteri, Fructobacillus spp., L. lactis and L. lactis. Yeast isolates included Clavispora lusitaniae, Cyberlindnera fabianii, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DGGE indicated predominance of S. cerevisiae in Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and also detected Pichia spp. and I. orientalis in Obutoko. Obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and later by Lactococcus spp. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp. were also detected in Ekitiribita. Development of starters for Obushera may require combinations of LAB and S. cerevisiae for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and LAB for Ekitiribita.
TI  - High-salt brines compromise autoinducer-mediated bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus  plantarum survival in Spanish-style green olive fermentations.
AB  - The effect of NaCl on plantaricin production by five Lactobacillus plantarum strains was investigated. Plantaricin production in these strains was found to be regulated by three-component regulatory systems ruled by two different autoinducer peptides (AIPs), either PLNC8IF or Plantaricin A. Bacteriocin activity exhibited by these strains came to a halt in liquid medium containing NaCl concentrations of or above 2%. In contrast, bacteriocin activity was still observed when the producing strains were growing on solid medium containing up to 4% NaCl. Bacteriocin activity in liquid medium containing up to 2% NaCl could be restored by coculturing the producing strains with a selected plantaricin-production inducing strain of Lactococcus lactis. Growth of these bacteriocinogenic L. plantarum strains was monitored in traditional Spanish-style green olive fermentations. Survival of these strains could not be enhanced when provided with a range of plantaricin-production inducing mechanisms previously described, such as constitutive AIP production or coinoculation with a specific bacteriocin-production inducing strain of L. lactis. Our results suggest that it is advisable the use of constitutive bacteriocin producers, or at least non-AIP-dependant ones, as starters for olive fermentations due to the intrinsic physical characteristics of this food fermentation, especially the high salt concentration of the brines currently used.
TI  - L. plantarum, L. salivarius, and L. lactis attenuate Th2 responses and increase Treg frequencies in healthy mice in a strain dependent manner.
AB  - Many studies on probiotics are aimed at restoring immune homeostasis in patients  to prevent disease recurrence or reduce immune-mediated pathology. Of equal interest is the use of probiotics in sub-clinical situations, which are characterized by reduced immune function or low-grade inflammation, with an increased risk of infection or disease as a consequence. Most mechanistic studies focus on the use of probiotics in experimental disease models, which may not be informative for these sub-clinical conditions. To gain better understanding of the effects in the healthy situation, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of two Lactobacillus probiotic strains, i.e. L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. salivarius UCC118, and a non-probiotic lactococcus strain, i.e. L. lactis MG1363, in healthy mice. We studied the effect of these bacteria on the systemic adaptive immune system after 5 days of administration. Only L. plantarum induced an increase in regulatory CD103(+) DC and regulatory T cell frequencies in the spleen. However, all three bacterial strains, including L. lactis, reduced specific splenic T helper cell cytokine responses after ex vivo restimulation. The effect on IFN-gamma, IL5, IL10, and IL17 production by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was dependent on the strain administered. A shared observation was that all three bacterial strains reduced T helper 2 cell frequencies. We demonstrate that systemic immunomodulation is not only observed after treatment with probiotic organisms, but also after treatment with non-probiotic bacteria. Our data demonstrate that in healthy mice, lactobacilli can balance T cell immunity in favor of a more regulatory status, via both regulatory T cell dependent and independent mechanisms in a strain dependent manner.
TI  - Investigation on culturable microflora in Tibetan kefir grains from different areas of China.
AB  - Four samples of Tibetan kefir grains (TK-ZJUJ 01-04) from Tibet and surrounding areas were investigated via phenotypic and genotypic methods to compare and analyze the diversity of culturable microflora among different origins. As a result, 4 genera of microorganisms from TK-ZJUJ01: Bacillus subtilis (2.9 x 10(7) cfu/mL), Lactococcus lactis (8.2 x 10(7) cfu/mL), Kluyveromyces marxianus (3.0 x 10(6) cfu/mL), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9.0 x 10(6) cfu/mL); 4 genera from TK-ZJUJ02: Lactobacillus kefiri (1.0 x 10(8) cfu/mL), Pichia kudriavzevii (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/mL), K. marxianus (1.9 x 10(7) cfu/mL), Kazachstania unispora (6.2 x 10(7) cfu/mL); 6 genera from TK-ZJUJ03: Leuconostoc lactis (4.6 x 10(7) cfu/mL), L. lactis (3.0 x 10(7) cfu/mL), Lactobacillus plantarum (3.0 x 10(7) cfu/mL), K. unispora (3.0 x 10(6) cfu/mL), K. marxianus (2.0 x 10(6) cfu/mL), (1.7 x 10(7) cfu/mL); and 4 genera from TK-ZJUJ04: L. plantarum (1.8 x 10(7) cfu/mL), Acetobacter fabarum (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/mL), K. unispora (6.2 x 10(7) cfu/mL), Pichia guilliermondii (6.2 x 10(7) cfu/mL) were identified. Yeasts like P. kudriavzevii and P. guilliermondii isolated in this study were the first time reported in Tibetan kefir grains. For TK-ZJUJ 01-03, lactic acid bacteria were the major microorganisms, which accounted for more than 50% of all the microbial population, while for TK-ZJUJ04, the largest microbial group was yeasts which accounted for more than 50%. In a word, study of diversity and composition of microflora provided us theoretical foundation for further investigation and application of Tibetan kefir grains. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This is the basic research in order to develop and industrialize a new kind of yogurt starter which is naturally formed microbiota with both lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in it.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Cultivable microbiota of Lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  - The cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive Lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. In order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. Then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were selected and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactococcus lactis, L. garvieae and Enterococcus gallinarum. Studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of Ent. gallinarum CRL 1826 which inhibited LAB species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. These results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus to reduce production costs. It could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.
TI  - Influence of cofermentation by amylolytic Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis strains on the fermentation process and rheology of sorghum porridge.
AB  - Amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (ALAB) can potentially replace malt in reducing the viscosity of starchy porridges. However, the drawback of using ALAB is their low and delayed amylolytic activity. This necessitates searching for efficient ALAB and strategies to improve their amylolytic activity. Two ALAB, Lactobacillus plantarum MNC 21 and Lactococcus lactis MNC 24, isolated from Obushera, were used to ferment starches in MRS broth: sorghum, millet, sweet potato, and commercial soluble starch. The amylolytic activity of MNC 21 was comparable to that of the ALAB collection strain Lb. plantarum A6, while that of MNC 24 was extremely low. MNC 21, MNC 24, and their coculture were compared to A6 and sorghum malt for ability to ferment and reduce the viscosity of sorghum porridge (11.6% dry matter). ALAB and the coculture lowered the pH from 6.2 to <4.5 within 12 h, while malt as a carrier of wild starter took about 20 h. Coculturing increased lactic acid yield by 46% and 76.8% compared to the yields of MNC 21 and MNC 24 monocultures, respectively. The coculture accumulated significantly larger (P < 0.05) amounts of maltose and diacetyl than the monocultures. Sorghum malt control and the coculture hydrolyzed more starch in sorghum porridge than the monocultures. The coculture initiated changes in the rheological parameters storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G''), phase angle (delta), and complex viscosity (eta*) earlier than its constituent monocultures. The shear viscosity of sorghum porridge was reduced significantly (P < 0.05) from 1950 cP to 110 cP (malt), 281 cP (coculture), 382 cP (MNC 21), 713 cP (MNC 24), and 722 cP (A6). Coculturing strong ALAB with weak ALAB or non-ALAB can be exploited for preparation of nutrient-dense weaning foods and increasing lactic acid yield from starchy materials.
TI  - Identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  - In order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 LAB strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. According to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups, including Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus acidipiscis, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, L. coryniformis subsp. torquens, L. curvatus, L. paraplantarum, L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella hellenica, Weissella paramesenteroides and Carnobacterium divergens. This is the first report to document that C. divergens, L. acidipiscis, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, L. garvieae, phenotypically novel L. lactis subsp. cremoris, E. gallinarum and W. hellenica are present in vegetative forage crops. L. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. Some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth pH and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. These results are useful in understanding the diversity of LAB associated with decayed silage of timothy and orchardgrass.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - Characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in PDO Salers cheese.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making PDO Salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. Gerles from ten farms producing PDO Salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least 4 periods spread over two years. They were distinguished by their levels of Lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log CFU/cm(2)), Gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log CFU/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log CFU/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log CFU/cm(2)). They were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. These 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). The farm gerles were not contaminated by Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. Only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. Even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in the 40 L experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. Using 40 L experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. They were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus hilgardii,...), Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Curtobacterium oceanosedimentum Citrococcus spp., Brachybacterium rhamnosum, Kocuria rhizophila, Arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus). In less than 1 min, even in a 500 L farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Italian ryegrass silage.
AB  - Twenty-three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from three cultivars (Akiaoba, Nagahahikari and Tachiwase) of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) silage were precisely characterized by a combination of phenotypic tests, genotypic 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and rapid PCR-based analyses, focusing on their useful phenotypes for silage preparation as inoculants. We successfully identified both at the species and subspecies levels: phenotypically novel Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum and Pediococcus parvulus. This is the first report to elucidate the presence of Lactobacillus coryniformis ssp. torquens and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum in Italian ryegrass silages. Physiological and biochemical tests revealed that phenotypic characteristics are different among the different strains of the same species and subspecies, and that the isolates show unique and diverse phenotypes related to fermentation factors, such as available carbohydrates, optimal growth pH and temperature. These results suggest that, for various well-preserved silage preparations, the isolates may be useful in producing novel inoculants corresponding to their optimally climatic and ecological niches.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in Taiwan. The microflora of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. In this study, LAB from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. RESULTS: A total of 103 LAB were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from its raw substrate, cucumber. These isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (A-G) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Leuconostoc lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Weissella cibaria and Weissella hellenica. The antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 Lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T) . CONCLUSION: Heterofermentative W. cibaria and Leu. lactis were the major LAB found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. In soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative L. pentosus and L. plantarum were the most abundant LAB. In addition, the results also suggested that HhaI and RsaI restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish W. hellenica and Weissella paramesenteroides.
TI  - Effects of wilting and molasses addition on fermentation and bacterial community  in guinea grass silage.
AB  - AIMS: Acetic acid is considered an important preservative in tropical grass ensiling. The objective of the current experiments was to follow the ensiling fermentation of low dry matter (DM) tropical grass as a model to study changes in bacterial communities during acetic acid fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Direct-cut and wilted guinea grass silage was prepared with and without molasses. A high acetic acid level was observed during the fermentation of direct-cut silage, and long storage increased the butyric acid and ethanol content if molasses was not added. The lactic acid production in wilted silage was greater than the acetic acid production, but prolonged ensiling decreased the lactic to acetic acid ratio regardless of molasses addition. Adding molasses enhanced the lactic acid content in both direct-cut and wilted silage. The bacterial community, identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, was affected by wilting and molasses addition. Bands for Pantoea sp. and Morganella sp. became faint when acetic acid fermentation was suppressed, and those for Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactococcus garvieae were detected when lactic acid fermentation was enhanced by wilting and molasses addition. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis were found throughout the ensiling process in all silage types. CONCLUSION: Distinct changes occurred in the bacterial community in guinea grass silage because of wilting and molasses addition. These changes could explain how lactic acid fermentation was enhanced but could not help determine which bacteria were associated with enhanced acetic acid fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study reveals the effects of wilting and molasses during ensiling of low DM tropical grasses and the associated bacteria.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus buchneri as expression systems: evaluation of different origins of replication for the design of suitable shuttle vectors.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to establish transformation protocols for Lactobacillus plantarum CD033 and Lactobacillus buchneri CD034, two industrial silage strains and to test the influence of selected origins of replication on plasmid copy number, plasmid stability, and plasmid incompatibility in these strains. Electro-transformation protocols were optimized by examination of the influence of different electroporation solutions and cell wall weakening agents on transformation efficiency. Using Lithium acetate as cell wall weakening agent, we could achieve transformation efficiencies of 8 x 10(4) transformants per 1 mug DNA for L. buchneri CD034 which is to our knowledge the highest described for this species up to now. In order to test feasibility of previously described origins of replication derived from Bacillus subtilis, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and two novel L. buchneri CD034 plasmids to drive replication in our two selected Lactobacillus strains, six shuttle vectors were constructed. Results indicate that, in terms of stable propagation and high gene copy numbers (up to 238 copies/chromosome), the most suitable origins of replication for the construction of expression vectors for the selected silage strains were the ones derived from the novel L. buchneri CD034 plasmids.
TI  - Study of the microbial ecology of wild and aquacultured Tunisian fresh fish.
AB  - Eighty samples of fresh fish were collected in Tunisia and analyzed for microbial load. Quality and hygienic safety of the meat and intestines of wild and aquacultured fresh fish were determined. The mesophilic aerobic plate count and populations of psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and other psychrotrophic bacteria ranged from 5.67 to 7.29, 4.51 to 6, and 5.07 to 6.21 log CFU/g, respectively. For all microbiological determinations, bacterial counts were lower in meat than in the intestines of fresh fish. For all samples lower microbial populations were found in most of the wild fish than in the aquacultured fish. No isolates of the pathogenic genera Salmonella and Listeria were detected in any sample. Among the 160 strains of biopreservative psychrotrophic LAB and the 150 strains of spoilage psychrotrophic gram-negative bacteria identified by biochemical and molecular methods, Lactobacillus (six species) and Pseudomonas (six species) predominated. Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Carnobacterium (C. piscicola and C. divergens), Aeromonas, and Photobacterium were the most common genera, and Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Aeromonas hydrophila were the most common species. These findings indicate that the microbiological quality of fresh fish in Tunisia can be preserved by controlling pathogenic and psychrotrophic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro assessment of the immunomodulatory effects of multispecies probiotic formulations for management of allergic diseases.
AB  - Modulation of the composition of the intestinal microbiota with probiotics could  possibly offer a way of prevention or management of allergic diseases. The objective of this study was to determine the immunomodulating effects of various multispecies probiotic combinations in vitro, as preamble to application in vivo. Multispecies probiotic combinations were formulated and tested for their effects on in vitro cytokine production by human mononuclear cells and were compared to products that already have shown beneficial effects in vivo. All 4 tested combinations of probiotics showed a 40-71% decrease of Th2 cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and a variable increase of Th1 (IFN-gamma) and Treg cytokine (IL-10) production compared to the medium. A specific probiotic mixture that contained Bifidobacterium breve W25, Bifidobacterium lactis ATCC SD 5219, B. lactis ATCC SD 5220, Lactobacillus plantarum W62, Lactobacillus salivarius W57 and Lactococcus lactis W19 was superior in its stimulating effect on IL-10 production (significant better than the other tested combinations; P=0.001). Modulation of in vitro cytokine production profiles can be used to differentiate between selected probiotic formulations for their immunomodulatory properties. In the future it should be demonstrated whether the immunomodulatory capacities from the multispecies probiotic formulation with the desired profile will be effective in vivo (in adolescents, followed by application in children).
TI  - Microbial dynamics during the ripening of a mixed cow and goat milk cheese manufactured using frozen goat milk curd.
AB  - To overcome the seasonal shortage of goat milk in mixed milk cheese manufacture,  pasteurized goat milk curd and high-pressure-treated raw goat milk curd manufactured in the spring were held at -24 degrees C for 4 mo, thawed, and mixed with fresh cow milk curd for the manufacture of experimental cheeses. Control cheeses were made from a mixture of pasteurized cow and goat milk. The microbiota of experimental and control cheeses was studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. Bacterial enumeration by classical methods showed lactic acid bacteria to be the dominant population in both control and experimental cheeses. In total, 681 isolates were grouped by partial amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) into 4 groups and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (563 isolates), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (72 isolates), Lactobacillus spp. (34 isolates), and Lc. lactis ssp. cremoris (12 isolates). Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) analysis of cheese showed (1) the predominance of Lc. lactis in all cheeses; (2) the presence of Leu. pseudomesenteroides population in all cheeses from d 15 onward; (3) the presence of a Lactobacillus plantarum population in control cheese until d 15 and in experimental cheeses throughout the ripening period. Due to the most diverse and complete set of peptidases present in the genus Lactobacillus, the prevalence of this population in experimental cheeses could give rise to differences in cheese flavor between experimental and control cheeses.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in Inner Mongolia of China.
AB  - Sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of Inner Mongolia in China.  It has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. In this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in Inner Mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by classical biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay of recA gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor Tu). The results revealed that all the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) paracasei (38 strains), L. fermentum (28 strains), L. plantarum (7 strains), L. brevis (4 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. amylolyticus (1 strain), Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (3 strains), E. italicus (2 strains) or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). The predominant LAB were L. casei and L. fermentum in sour congee samples. The diversity of LAB derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and RFLP patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the L. casei group.
TI  - Functional compounds in fermented buckwheat sprouts.
AB  - Fermented buckwheat sprouts (FBS) are used as multifunctional foods. Their production process includes fermentation with lactic acid bacteria. The major strains were found to include Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Pediococcus pentosaceus in an investigation of the lactic acid bacteria. We searched for the functional components, and nicotianamine (NA) and 2''-hydroxynicotianamine (HNA) were identified as angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. NA and HNA increased during fermentation. Indole-3-ethanol was identified as an antioxidant (a SOD active substance), and may have been generated from tryptophan during fermentation because it was not contained in green buckwheat juice. A safety test demonstrated that FBS contained were safe functional food components, showing negative results in buckwheat allergy tests. Any buckwheat allergy substances might have been degraded during the fermentation process.
TI  - The investigation of probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Mongolian dairy products.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) isolated from traditional Mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. We collected 66 samples of the traditional Mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 LAB strains were isolated and identified based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence. The predominant species of those products were Lactobacillus (L.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. However, we could not detect any LAB strains from eezgii. All LAB isolates were screened for tolerance to low pH and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to Caco-2 cells. In vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as L. plantarum or L. paracasei subspecies, based on 16S ribosomal DNA and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. These strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the Dornogovi province.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Homo-D-lactic acid production from mixed sugars using xylose-assimilating operon-integrated Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - In order to achieve efficient D-lactic acid fermentation from a mixture of xylose and glucose, the xylose-assimilating xylAB operon from Lactobacillus pentosus (PXylAB) was introduced into an L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL1)-deficient Lactobacillus plantarum (DeltaldhL1-xpk1::tkt-Deltaxpk2) strain in which the phosphoketolase 1 gene (xpk1) was replaced with the transketolase gene (tkt) from Lactococcus lactis, and the phosphoketolase 2 (xpk2) gene was deleted. Two copies of xylAB introduced into the genome significantly improved the xylose fermentation ability, raising it to the same level as that of DeltaldhL1-xpk1::tkt-Deltaxpk2 harboring a xylAB operon-expressing plasmid. Using the two-copy xylAB integrated strain, successful homo-D-lactic acid production was achieved from a mixture of 25 g/l xylose and 75 g/l glucose without carbon catabolite repression. After 36-h cultivation, 74.2 g/l of lactic acid was produced with a high yield (0.78 g per gram of consumed sugar) and an optical purity of D-lactic acid of 99.5%. Finally, we successfully demonstrated homo-D-lactic acid fermentation from a mixture of three kinds of sugar: glucose, xylose, and arabinose. This is the first report that describes homo-D-lactic acid fermentation from mixed sugars without carbon catabolite repression using the xylose-assimilating pathway integrated into lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Expression of immune-related genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) induced by probiotic bacteria during Lactococcus garvieae infection.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the control of lactococcosis as well as to assess the impact of probiotics on the expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney and intestine of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, were administered orally at 10(6) CFU g(-)(1) feed to fish for 36 days. Twenty-one days after the start of the feeding period, fish were challenged with Lactococcus garvieae. Only the fish fed the diet containing Lb. plantarum showed significantly (P < 0.05) improved protection against L. garvieae compared to the control. Subsequently, real-time PCR was employed to determine the mRNA levels of IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha in the head kidney, and IL-8, Tlr5 and IgT in the intestine of the control and Lb. plantarum groups. IL-1beta, IL-10 and TNF-alpha gene expression were significantly up-regulated by Lb. plantarum. Moreover, the mRNA levels of IL-10, IL-8 and IgT were significantly higher in the Lb. plantarum group after L. garvieae infection, suggesting that Lb. plantarum can stimulate the immune response of rainbow trout. PCR-DGGE revealed no detectable levels of the probiotics or the pathogen present on the distal intestinal mucosa. These findings demonstrate that direct probiotic-host interactions with the intestine are not always necessary to induce host stimulatory responses which ultimately enhance disease resistance. Furthermore, as L. garvieae did not colonise the intestinal tract, and therefore likely did not infect via this route, the antagonistic properties of the probiotic candidate towards L. garvieae were likely of little influence in mediating the improved disease resistance which could be attributed to the elevated immunological response.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from yan-jiang (fermented  ginger), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yan-jiang (fermented ginger) is a popular traditional fermented food  in Taiwan. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) microflora in yan-jiang has not been studied in detail. In this study, LAB from yan-jiang were isolated, characterised and identified. RESULTS: A total of 176 LAB were isolated; 160 cultures were isolated from yan-jiang samples and 16 cultures were isolated from raw ginger. These isolates were characterised phenotypically and then divided into nine groups (A to I) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Lactobacillus sakei and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the major LAB found in the initial 2 days of fermentation without pickled plums; these species were mostly replaced by Weissella cibaria and L. plantarum after 3 days of fermentation. In the fermentation bucket with added pickled plums, W. cibaria was the most abundant LAB found during fermentation. The antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined. Twenty-four Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and 19 W. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain L. sakei JCM 1157(T) . CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that various LAB species were more numerous when fermentation was carried out without pickled plums. LAB also had effects on the aroma and flavour of yan-jiang.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a South African food.
AB  - Ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. Insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. In this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of V3-16S rRNA gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16S rRNA and/or pheS gene sequence analysis. The entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to pH evolution and microbial succession. The first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by relatively high pH conditions and the presence of Enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. The second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Weissella cibaria, Enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of Lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The Lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with PCR-DGGE, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. These findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.
TI  - Natural populations of lactic acid bacteria associated with silage fermentation as determined by phenotype, 16S ribosomal RNA and recA gene analysis.
AB  - One hundred and fifty-six strains isolated from corn (Zea mays L.), forage paddy  rice (Oryza sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silages prepared on dairy farms were screened, of which 110 isolates were considered to be lactic acid bacteria (LAB) according to their Gram-positive and catalase-negative characteristics and, mainly, the lactic acid metabolic products. These isolates were divided into eight groups (A-H) based on the following properties: morphological and biochemical characteristics, gamma-aminobutyric acid production capacity, and 16S rRNA gene sequences. They were identified as Weissella cibaria (36.4%), Weissella confusa (9.1%), Leuconostoc citreum (5.3%), Leuconostoc lactis (4.9%), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (8.0%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (4.5%), Lactobacillus paraplantarum (4.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (27.3%). W. cibaria and W. confusa were mainly present in corn silages, and L. plantarum was dominant on sorghum and forage paddy rice silages, while L. pseudomesenteroides, L. plantarum and L. paraplantarum were the dominant species in alfalfa silage. The corn, sorghum and forage paddy rice silages were well preserved with lower pH values and ammonia-N concentrations, but had higher lactic acid content, while the alfalfa silage had relatively poor quality with higher pH values and ammonia-N concentrations, and lower lactic acid content. The present study confirmed the diversity of LAB species inhabiting silages. It showed that the differing natural populations of LAB on these silages might influence fermentation quality. These results will enable future research on the relationship between LAB species and silage fermentation quality, and will enhance the screening of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving such quality.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented West African cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  - In this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in Nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. In particular, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE fingerprints identified species related to Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. A more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the Lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the Streptococcaceae family. Interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. For example, L. plantarum, L. pantheris and L. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while W. confusa, Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. Phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria from musts and wines of three consecutive vintages of Ribeira Sacra.
AB  - AIMS: This study was designed to isolate and characterize the lactic acid microbiota of the musts and wines of a young denomination of origin area, Ribeira Sacra in north-west Spain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Over three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2009), we examined musts and wines from four cellars in different zones of the region. Through biochemical and genetic tests, 459 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were identified as the following species: Lactobacillus alvei (0.7%), Lactobacillus brevis (1.7%), Lactobacillus frumenti (0.9%), Lactobacillus kunkeei (12%), Lactobacillus plantarum (6.5%), Lactobacillus pentosus (0.9%), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (3%), Leuconostoc citreum (0.7%), Leuconostoc fructosum (synon. Lactobacillus fructosum) (3.7%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides (2.8%), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (0.2%), Oenococcus oeni (59%), Pediococcus parvulus (7%) and Weisella paramesenteroides (synon. Leuconostoc paramesenteroides) (0.9%). Of these species, O. oeni was the main one responsible for malolactic fermentation (MLF) in all cellars and years with the exception of Lact. plantarum, predominant in 2007, in one cellar, and Lact. brevis, Lact. frumenti and Ped. parvulus coexisting with O. oeni in one cellar in 2009. Different strains (84) of LAB species (14) were identified by biochemical techniques (API strips, the presence of plasmids, enzyme activities and MLF performance) and molecular techniques (PCR). All assays were carried out with every one of the 459 isolates. To select candidates for use as culture starters, we assessed malolactic, beta-glucosidase and tannase activities, the presence of genes involved in biogenic amine production and plasmid content. CONCLUSIONS: A high diversity of LAB is present in the grape musts of Ribeira Sacra but few species are responsible for MLF; however, different strains of such species are involved in the process. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of Lact. frumenti thriving in wine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Information on LAB populations in must and wine is presented. A large collection of well-characterized strains of LAB are available as starter cultures to winemakers.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum extracellular chitin-binding protein and its role in the  interaction between chitin, Caco-2 cells, and mucin.
AB  - In the present work, we describe the adhesion capabilities of a recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain producing an extracellular protein from Lactobacillus plantarum. Our results show that this protein may offer the bacterium a mechanism to bind to N-acetylglucosamine-containing polymers, such as human mucins, present in different environments.
TI  - FTIR-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Greek Graviera cheese.
AB  - This study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (Fourier Transformed Infra-Red [FTIR] spectroscopy) and molecular (RFLP and SSCP analysis of 16S rRNA genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora present in traditional Greek Graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. A total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of TSAYE (incubated at 30 degrees C), M-17 (22 degrees C) and M-17 (42 degrees C) agar media were clustered by FTIR and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by all methods. Based on their FTIR spectra, 282 isolates were LAB grouped in 28 clusters. The LAB species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), Enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and Lactococcus lactis (0.7%). Also, Staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), Corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and Brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from TSAYE. Comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the LAB species identified. The present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid FTIR screening of 10-fold more isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant LAB species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.
TI  - Isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ripe mulberries in Taiwan.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate, characterize, and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from ripe mulberries collected in Taiwan. Ripe mulberry samples were collected at five mulberry farms, located in different counties of Taiwan. Eighty-eight acid-producing cultures were isolated from these samples, and isolates were divided into classes first by phenotype, then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics led to identification of four bacterial groups (A to D). Weissella cibaria was the most abundant type of LAB distributed in four mulberry farms, and Lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant LAB found in the remaining farm. Ten W. cibaria and one Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate produced bacteriocins against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T). These results suggest that various LAB are distributed in ripe mulberries and W. cibaria was the most abundant LAB found in this study.
TI  - Heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - This study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (GH42) beta-galactosidase of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LacA) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of oNPG, pNPG and pNPG-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) formation to GH2 beta-galactosidases of Streptococcus thermophilus (LacZ type), Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both LacLM type). Beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in Lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with L. lactis crude cell extract (CCE). The novel GH42 beta-galactosidase of Lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, oNPG and pNPG but higher relative activity on pNP analogues compared to GH2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. Temperature and pH optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between GH2 beta-galactosidases. oNPG and pNPG were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pNPG-analogues was less than 1.5%. GH2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar GOS with varying preferences. The diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in L. lactis CCE can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.
TI  - Effect of freeze-drying on viability and in vitro probiotic properties of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from kefir.
AB  - The effect of freeze-drying on viability and probiotic properties of a microbial  mixture containing selected bacterial and yeast strains isolated from kefir grains (Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces marxianus) was studied. The microorganisms were selected according to their potentially probiotic properties in vitro already reported. Two types of formulations were performed, a microbial mixture (MM) suspended in milk and a milk product fermented with MM (FMM). To test the effect of storage on viability of microorganisms, MM and FMM were freeze-dried and maintained at 4 degrees C for six months. After 180 days of storage at 4 degrees C, freeze-dried MM showed better survival rates for each strain than freeze-dried FMM. The addition of sugars (trehalose or sucrose) did not improve the survival rates of any of the microorganisms after freeze-drying. Freeze-drying did not affect the capacity of MM to inhibit growth of Shigella sonnei in vitro, since the co-incubation of this pathogen with freeze-dried MM produced a decrease of 2 log in Shigella viability. The safety of freeze-dried MM was tested in mice and non-translocation of microorganisms to liver or spleen was observed in BALB/c mice feed ad libitum during 7 or 20 days. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the effect of freeze-drying on viability, in vitro probiotic properties and microbial translocation of a mixture containing different strains of both bacteria and yeasts isolated from kefir.
TI  - Microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
AB  - The diversity, dynamics and activity of Castelmagno PDO cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the Grana Valley (northwest Italy), during the wintertime. Samples of milk, curd and cheese (core and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. In particular, DNA and RNA directly extracted from the matrices were studied by PCR-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-DGGE. Culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species Streptococcus thermophilus and S. agalactiae. Then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with Lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of Castelmagno PDO ripening. At this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lb. casei. Culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of L. lactis, actively involved in both Castelmagno PDO manufacturing and ripening. Despite Lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a DGGE band referred to this microorganism was detected, at RNA level, in samples from ripened cheeses. On the other hand, Lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. Due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
TI  - The effect of ripening and storage conditions on the distribution of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine in Edam-cheese.
AB  - The aim of the work was to describe the development of selected biogenic amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine) in 4 layers of Dutch-type cheese (Edam-cheese) depending on 3 ripening/storage regimes during a 98-day period. Biogenic amines were analysed by means of ion-exchange chromatography. A further goal was to identify microbial sources of biogenic amines in the material analysed. Phenotype characterization and repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting were used to identify the isolated bacteria. The highest content of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine was determined in cheeses stored in a ripening cellar at a temperature of 10 degrees C during the whole observation period. Lower biogenic amines content was determined in samples which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees C) after 38 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees C). The lowest concentrations of biogenic amines were detected in cheeses which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees C) after 23 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees C). During the 98-day period, histamine was not detected in any of the regimes. Within the cheeses analysed, non-starter lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum were detected as the main producers of the biogenic amines tested. In starter bacteria Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris the decarboxylase activity tested was not detected.
TI  - Natural populations of lactic acid bacteria isolated from vegetable residues and  silage fermentation.
AB  - Natural populations of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and silage fermentation of vegetable residues were studied. Fifty-two strains of LAB isolated from cabbage, Chinese cabbage, and lettuce residues were identified and characterized. The LAB strains were gram-positive and catalase-negative bacteria, which were divided into 6 groups (A to F) according to morphological and biochemical characteristics. The strains in group A were rods that did not produce gas from glucose and formed the d and l isomers of lactate. Groups B and C were homofermentative cocci that formed l-lactic acid. Groups D, E, and F were heterofermentative cocci that formed d-lactic acid. Based on 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, group A to F strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus piscium, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Weissella soli and Leuconostoc gelidum, respectively. The prevalent LAB, predominantly homofermentative lactobacilli, consisted of Lactobacillus plantarum (34.6%), Weissella soli (19.2%), Leuconostoc gelidum (15.4%), Leuconostoc citreum (13.5%), Lactococcus lactis (9.6%), and Lactococcus piscium (7.7%). Lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant member of the LAB population in 3 types of vegetable residues. These vegetable residues contained a high level of crude protein (20.2 to 28.4% of dry matter). These silages prepared by using a small-scale fermentation system were well preserved, with low pH and a relatively high content of lactate. This study suggests that the vegetable residues contain abundant LAB species and nutrients, and that they could be well preserved by making silage, which is a potentially good vegetable protein source for livestock diets.
TI  - Molecular identification of naturally occurring bacteriocinogenic and bacteriocinogenic-like lactic acid bacteria in raw milk and soft cheese.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are currently used by food industries because of their ability to produce metabolites with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. The objectives of this study were to identify naturally occurring bacteriocinogenic or bacteriocinogenic-like LAB in raw milk and soft cheese and to detect the presence of nisin-coding genes in cultures identified as Lactococcus lactis. Lactic acid bacteria cultures were isolated from 389 raw milk and soft cheese samples and were later characterized for the production of antimicrobial substances against Listeria monocytogenes. Of these, 58 (14.9%) LAB cultures were identified as antagonistic; the nature of this antagonistic activity was then characterized via enzymatic tests to confirm the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial substances. In addition, 20 of these antagonistic cultures were selected and submitted to genetic sequencing; they were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (n=2) and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (n=18). Nisin genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction in 7 of these cultures. The identified bacteriocinogenic and bacteriocinogenic-like cultures were highly variable concerning the production and activity of antimicrobial substances, even when they were genetically similar. The obtained results indicated the need for molecular and phenotypic methodologies to properly characterize bacteriocinogenic LAB, as well as the potential use of these cultures as tools to provide food safety.
TI  - Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  - The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.
TI  - Community dynamics of bacteria in sourdough fermentations as revealed by their metatranscriptome.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterial (LAB) community dynamics of two wheat and two spelt sourdough fermentations that were daily back-slopped were monitored during a period of 10 days by hybridizing time-related RNA samples, representing the metatranscriptome, to an LAB functional gene microarray. To indicate the species present in each hybridized sample, annotation information for the 2,269 oligonucleotides on the microarray was used. The overall hybridization data revealed that after a transition phase of 5 days, in which atypical sourdough LAB species, including Enterococcus species, were found, a stabilized ecosystem was established with Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum as the dominating LAB species. Compared with the combined outcome of culture-dependent and culture-independent identification techniques, the microarray data revealed a functional role for Lactococcus lactis in the early stage ecosystem and the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus in most of the fermentations, besides L. plantarum and L. fermentum. Consequently, metatranscriptome hybridization data obtained using an LAB functional gene microarray was shown to be an interesting alternative to microbiological analysis of the community dynamics of complex food ecosystems.
TI  - Functional and morphological adaptation to peptidoglycan precursor alteration in  Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Cell wall peptidoglycan assembly is a tightly regulated process requiring the combined action of multienzyme complexes. In this study we provide direct evidence showing that substrate transformations occurring at the different stages of this process play a crucial role in the spatial and temporal coordination of the cell wall synthesis machinery. Peptidoglycan substrate alteration was investigated in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis by substituting the peptidoglycan precursor biosynthesis genes of this bacterium for those of the vancomycin-resistant bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum. A set of L. lactis mutant strains in which the normal d-Ala-ended precursors were partially or totally replaced by d-Lac-ended precursors was generated. Incorporation of the altered precursor into the cell wall induced morphological changes arising from a defect in cell elongation and cell separation. Structural analysis of the muropeptides confirmed that the activity of multiple enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis was altered. Optimization of this altered pathway was necessary to increase the level of vancomycin resistance conferred by the utilization of d-Lac-ended peptidoglycan precursors in the mutant strains. The implications of these findings on the control of bacterial cell morphogenesis and the mechanisms of vancomycin resistance are discussed.
TI  - Enzymatic activity of lactic acid bacteria (with antimicrobial properties) isolated from a traditional Spanish cheese.
AB  - Twenty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from a traditional Spanish cheese (Genestoso cheese) were evaluated for their enzymatic activities (acidifying and proteolytic abilities and carboxypeptidase, aminopeptidase, dipeptidase, caseinolytic and esterase activities), in order to select indigenous strains of technical interest for the manufacture of cheese. These strains were selected on the basis of their antimicrobial activity relative to five reference strains and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (thirteen strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (two strains), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (one strain), Lactobacillus paracasei (two strains), Lactobacillus plantarum (one strain) and Enterococcus faecalis (five strains). Lactococcus strains were those that showed the greatest degree of acidifying and proteolytic activity. The cell-free extracts (CFE) of L. paracasei exhibited the highest level of aminopeptidase activity. The highest level of caseinolytic activity was shown by the CFE of one strain of L. lactis. High values were also obtained with the CFE of Lactobacillus and of several Leuconostoc. The highest level of dipeptidase activity was found amongst the strains of L. lactis. Carboxypeptidase activity was generally very low or undetectable for the majority of strains. The greatest degree of esterolytic activity was detected for Enterococcus.
TI  - Intragastric administration of a superoxide dismutase-producing recombinant Lactobacillus casei BL23 strain attenuates DSS colitis in mice.
AB  - Human immune cells release large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide via respiratory burst. In inflammatory bowel diseases, a sustained and abnormal activation of the immune response results in oxidative stress of the digestive tract and in a loss of intestinal homeostasis. We previously reported that heterologous production of the Lactobacillus plantarum manganese catalase (MnKat) enhances the survival of Lb. casei BL23 when exposed to oxidative stress. Anti-inflammatory effects were observed after Lb. casei BL23 oral administrations in moderate murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, without added effects of the MnKat production. Here, we evaluated the protective effects obtained by an improved antioxidative strategy. The Lactococcus lactis sodA gene was expressed in Lb. casei BL23 which acquired an efficient manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity. The effects of Lb. casei MnSOD alone or in combination with Lb. casei MnKat were compared first in eukaryotic cell PMA-induced oxidative stress model and then in severe murine DSS-induced colitis. Based on ROS production assays as well as colonic histological scores, a significant reduction of both oxidative stress and inflammation was observed with Lb. casei MnSOD either alone or in combination with Lb. casei MnKat. No added effect of the presence of Lb. casei MnKat was observed. These results suggest that Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD could have anti-inflammatory effects on gut inflammation.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional cachaca fermentations.
AB  - During the production of traditional cachaca (alembic s cachaca), contamination of the fermented must is one of the factors leading to economic losses in the beverage manufacturing industry. The diversity of bacterial populations and the role of these microorganisms during the cachaca production process are still poorly understood in Brazil. In our work, the fermentation process was followed in two distilleries located in the state of Minas Gerais. The objective of this work was to identify the populations of lactic acid bacteria present during cachaca fermentation using physiological and molecular methods. Lactic acid bacteria were isolated in high frequencies during all of the fermentative processes, and Lactobacillus plantarum and L. casei were the most prevalent species. Other lactic acid bacteria were found in minor frequencies, such as L. ferintoshensis, L. fermentum, L. jensenii, L. murinus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus sp. and Weissella confusa. These bacteria could contribute to the increase of volatile acidity levels or to the production of compounds that could influence the taste and aroma of the beverage.
TI  - How three adventitious lactic acid bacteria affect proteolysis and organic acid production in model Portuguese cheeses manufactured from several milk sources and two alternative coagulants.
AB  - Model cheeses were manufactured according to a full factorial experimental design to help shed light on the individual and combined roles played by 3 native lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus plantarum) upon proteolysis and organic acid evolution in cheese. The model cheeses were manufactured according to a generally representative Portuguese artisanal protocol, but the (ubiquitous) adventitious microflora in the cheesemaking milk were removed via sterilization before manufacture; therefore, the specific effects of only those lactic acid bacteria selected were monitored. In addition, 2 types of coagulant (animal and plant) and 3 types of cheesemaking milk (cow, sheep, and goat) were assessed to determine their influence on the final characteristics of the model cheeses. The nature of the coagulant appeared to be essential during the first stage of proteolysis as expected, whereas the contribution of those bacteria to the pools of total free AA and organic acids was crucial afterward. This was especially so in terms of the differences observed in the metabolisms of lactic acid (in the case of Lactococcus spp.) as well as acetic and citric acids (in the case of Lactobacillus spp.).
TI  - Pecorino Crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal Pecorino Crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout cheese ripening, with the dominance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus species. Bacterial dynamics determined by Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus buchneri and Leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. Moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. Fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of Pecorino Crotonese cheeses by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.
TI  - Probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  - This study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. Bella di Cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) NaCl) at room temperature and 4 degrees C. The probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural LAB population and decreasing the pH of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. The dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host Enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. Yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 CFU/g) throughout the process. A considerable genetic diversity of LAB species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% NaCl, as indicated by the Shannon diversity index calculated for each set. Generally, strains of Lactobacillus coryniformis, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. pentosus, L. rhamnosus, L. brevis, L. mali, L. vaccinostercus, L.casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuc. pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Weissella paramesenteroides, W. cibaria, Enterococcus casseliflavus group and E. italicus were identified during the whole process. In particular, L. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees C. Also a notable incidence of Leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. Results indicated that the human strain L. paracasei IMPC2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Microbiota analysis of Caspian Sea yogurt, a ropy fermented milk circulated in Japan.
AB  - We analyzed the microbiota of domestic ropy fermented milk, Caspian Sea yogurt (or 'kasupikai yohguruto' in Japanese), circulated in Japan. We collected six varieties from five localities. Lactococcus (L) lactis ssp. cremoris was isolated from all samples as the dominant strain at levels of 10(8)-10(9) CFU/g. We show this strain produces an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) that causes the unique characteristic viscosity of the product. From analysis of the RAPD pattern of 60 bacterial isolates from the six samples, we found that 59 strains from a total of 60 isolates were identical and produced this viscosity. Furthermore, PFGE analysis of representative strains from each sample indicated that the isolates could be classified into four subgroups. This suggests these L. lactis ssp. cremoris strains found in Caspian Sea yogurt may have been slightly mutated during subculture in Japan. In addition, Lactobacillus (L.) sakei ssp. sakei were isolated from three samples; L. plantarum, Gluconoacetobacter sacchari and Acetobacter aceti were isolated from two samples; and L. paracasei, L. kefiri, Leuconostoc (Leu.) mesenteroides were isolated from one sample.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from  marketed foods and drugs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and E-test methods after species-level identification. Resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by PCR. RESULTS: Distribution of resistance was found in different species. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. In addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. In contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. The genes msrC, vanX, and dfrA were detected in strains of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. Evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.
TI  - High-level expression of Lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in Lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system NICE.
AB  - In this work the overlapping genes (lacL and lacM) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri , Lb. acidophilus , Lb. sakei , and Lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (NICE) vectors and expressed using Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and NZ3900 as hosts. The lacL gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisA. Chloramphenicol was employed as selection marker for the standard system using L. lactis NZ9000, whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacF gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing L. lactis NZ3900. Comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 kU/L of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the lacLM genes and the selection marker used. The occurrence of codons less frequently used by L. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacL gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of lacLM from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.
TI  - Characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from Irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 Leuconostoc, and 2 pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the E-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. The corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by PCR. Also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. Of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The erm(B) and msrA/B genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. Two tetracycline-resistant strains, Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(M) and tet(S) genes respectively. Intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and Leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (strA, strB, aadA, aadE) were identified. Four of 10 strains of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this phenotype were identified. Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. L. plantarum, L. mesenteroides and Pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. Transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(M) gene of L. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to Lactococcus lactis BU-2-60 and to E. faecalis JH2-2. This study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in Irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other LAB strains.
TI  - Use of sourdough fermentation and pseudo-cereals and leguminous flours for the making of a functional bread enriched of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum C48 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis PU1, previously  selected for the biosynthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), were used for sourdough fermentation of cereal, pseudo-cereal and leguminous flours. Chickpea, amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat were the flours most suitable to be enriched of GABA. The parameters of sourdough fermentation were optimized. Addition of 0.1mM pyridoxal phosphate, dough yield of 160, inoculum of 5 x 10(7)CFU/g of starter bacteria and fermentation for 24h at 30 degrees C were found to be the optimal conditions. A blend of buckwheat, amaranth, chickpea and quinoa flours (ratio 1:1:5.3:1) was selected and fermented with baker's yeast (non-conventional flour bread, NCB) or with Lb. plantarum C48 sourdough (non-conventional flour sourdough bread, NCSB) and compared to baker's yeast started wheat flour bread (WFB). NCSB had the highest concentration of free amino acids and GABA (ca. 4467 and 504 mg/kg, respectively). The concentration of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of NCSB bread was the highest, as well as the rate of in vitro starch hydrolysis was the lowest. Texture analysis showed that sourdough fermentation enhances several characteristics of NCSB with respect to NCB, thus approaching the features of WFB. Sensory analysis showed that sourdough fermentation allowed to get good palatability and overall taste appreciation.
TI  - Genotypic identification of some lactic acid bacteria by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis and investigation of their potential usage as starter culture combinations in Beyaz cheese manufacture.
AB  - In this study, 2 different starter culture combinations were prepared for cheesemaking. Starter culture combinations were formed from 8 strains of lactic acid bacteria. They were identified as Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (2 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum (5 strains), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 strain) by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. The effects of these combinations on the physicochemical and microbiological properties of Beyaz cheeses were investigated. These cheeses were compared with Beyaz cheeses that were produced with a commercial starter culture containing Lc. lactis ssp. lactis and Lc. lactis ssp. cremoris as control. All cheeses were ripened in brine at 4 degrees C for 90 d. Dry matter, fat in dry matter, titratable acidity, pH, salt in dry matter, total N, water-soluble N, and ripening index were determined. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE patterns of cheeses showed that alpha(S)-casein and beta-casein degraded slightly during the ripening period. Lactic acid bacteria, total mesophilic aerobic bacteria, yeast, molds, and coliforms were also counted. All analyses were repeated twice during d 7, 30, 60, and 90. The starter culture combinations were found to be significantly different from the control group in pH, salt content, and lactobacilli, lactococci, and total mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts, whereas the cheeses were similar in fat, dry matter content, and coliform, yeast, and mold counts. The sensory analysis of cheeses indicated that textural properties of control cheeses presented somewhat lower scores than those of the test groups. The panelists preferred the tastes of treatment cheeses, whereas cheeses with starter culture combinations and control cheeses had similar scores for appearance and flavor. These results indicated that both starter culture combinations are suitable for Beyaz cheese production.
TI  - Diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of Casin, a traditional Spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  - Classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional Spanish Casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. As with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of Casin was shown to be high by both culturing and DGGE analyses. The culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. Of the 14 bacterial species identified, Lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. As expected, the DGGE profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. Among these, a band corresponding to Streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. This species had never been identified from traditional Spanish cheeses previously. Culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of Casin manufacture. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling suggested that the L. garvieae and L. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. In addition, only a single L. lactis RAPD pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. After a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two Lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for Casin. Additional species (such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.
TI  - Polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with Tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  - The objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected from different areas of Tunisia. A polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal DNA-based techniques, was used to identify Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates. PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR of 102 isolates and other reference LAB strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (M-ISR) for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and M-ISR) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and L-ISR) for Lactobacilli, and (4) three PCR amplicons (S-ISR, M-ISR, and L-ISR) obtained for Pediococcus spp. and Weissella genus. The clustering and comparison of ISR-RFLP profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference LAB strains, allowed their identification as Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Enterococcus hawaiiensis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Weissella confusa. Combined 16S-23S rDNA ISR and RFLP patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of LAB and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in French wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific PCR.
AB  - The lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the Midi-Pyrenees area (South western France) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. However, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. In the present study, a total of 290 LAB isolates were identified by PCR amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional French sourdoughs. Overall, the LAB isolates belonged to 6 genera: Lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), Pediococcus (38%, 1 species), Leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), Weissella (4%, 2 species), Lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and Enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: L. plantarum, L. curvatus, L. paracasei, L. sanfranciscensis, L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum, L. sakei, L. brevis, P. pentosaceus, L. mesenteroides, L. citreum, W. cibaria, W. confusa, L. lactis and E. hirae. Facultative heterofermentative LAB represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus. Obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (L. sanfranciscencis, L. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas Leuconostoc and Weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. Detection of some LAB species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. The number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative LAB species have been revealed. Results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of LAB cocci in the sourdough ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.
TI  - Improvement of constipation and liver function by plant-derived lactic acid bacteria: a double-blind, randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) contribute to human health; however, the probiotic properties vary among strains classified into the same species. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of yogurts made by different types of LAB on the gastrointestinal system. The yogurts were also evaluated by measuring serum lipid contents and liver functional indicators as a secondary objective. METHODS: Healthy human adults (n = 68) with some complaints with regard to intestinal health, including constipation and diarrhea, were randomly assigned to receive one of three types of yogurt in a double-blind manner: type A, a yogurt made by plant-derived LAB (mainly Lactobacillus [Lb.] plantarum SN35N); type B, a yogurt made by plant-derived LAB (mainly Lb. plantarum SN13T); and type C, a yogurt made by animal-derived LAB (mainly Lactococcus lactis A6 and Streptococcus thermophilus 510) as a control. The subjects consumed 100 g of yogurt daily for 6 wk. Data were collected from clinical visits at 2-wk intervals and by diaries used to record defecation and health conditions. RESULTS: Drastic and constant increments of defecation frequency in subjects with constipation were observed with type A and B yogurts but not with type C yogurt. Type B and C yogurts resulted in decreases in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The serum concentrations of liver functional parameters were improved by the type B yogurt (12-25% reduction). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that Lb. plantarum SN13T exhibits a superior probiotic effect on constipation in addition to improving the serum lipid contents and liver function.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel tuf promoter from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403.
AB  - Genetic engineering of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) requires a reliable gene expression system. Especially, a stable promoter is an important genetic element to induce gene expression in such a system. We report on a novel tuf promoter (Ptuf) of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 that was screened and selected through analysis of previously published microarray data. Ptuf activity was examined and compared with three other known lactococcal promoters (PdnaJ, PpfkA, and Pusp45) using different bacteria as expression hosts. Each promoter was, respectively, fused to the promoterless and modified bmpB gene as a reporter, and we estimated promoter activity through BmpB expression. All promoters were active in IL1403, and Ptuf activity was strongest among them. The activity of each promoter differed by host bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum Lb25, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC23272, and Escherichia coli Top10F'). Ptuf had the highest activity in IL1403 when growth reached late log phase. The activity of each promoter correlated with the expression of each cognate gene in the microarray data (R (2) = 0.7186, P = 0.06968). This study revealed that novel food-grade promoters such as IL1403 Ptuf can be selected from microarray data for food-grade microorganisms and Ptuf can be used to develop a reliable gene expression system in L. lactis.
TI  - Main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of Ugandan ghee.
AB  - Ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western Uganda. However, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. The aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. L. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. Two of the four most commonly isolated LAB species (L. helveticus and L. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (PCR-DGGE). Other main LAB species identified in mashita by PCR-DGGE were Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus sp., Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius. The main species of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified in the mashita using PCR-DGGE method were Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. PCR-DGGE identification of yeasts showed that Brettanomyces custersianus, Candida silvae, Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia occidentalis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. A. lovaniensis, A. aceti, and I. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using PCR-DGGE method. Other microbial species were only found in some samples. These results indicate that LAB and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also AAB are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Heme and menaquinone induced electron transport in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. In this report, we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait. RESULTS: Heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species and genera of lactic acid bacteria. These include Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacilllus brevis, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Streptococcus entericus and Lactococcus garviae. The increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits, are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 Lactococcus lactis insertion mutants. Respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxA, bd-type cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. Phenotypic screening and in silico genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species. CONCLUSION: We propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes among the species.
TI  - Changes in the microbial composition of raw milk induced by thermization treatments applied prior to traditional Greek hard cheese processing.
AB  - The microbiological quality, safety, and composition of mixtures of ewe's and goat's milk (90:10) used for cheesemaking were evaluated before and after thermization at 60 and 67 degrees C for 30 s. Such mild thermal treatments are commonly applied to reduce natural contaminants of raw milk before processing for traditional hard Greek cheeses. Raw milk samples had an average total bacterial count of 7.3 log CFU/ml; most of these bacteria were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and pseudomonads. The LAB flora of raw milk was dominated by enterococci (40.8%), followed by lactococci (20.4%), leuconostocs (18.4%), and mesophilic lactobacilli (10.2%). Enterococcus faecalis (30.1%) and Enterococcus faecium (13.7%) were the most common LAB isolates, followed by Enterococcus durans, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc lactis. Thermization at 60 degrees C for 30 s was effective for reducing raw milk contamination by enterobacteria (5.1 log CFU/ml), coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.3 log CFU/ml), and Listeria (present in 25-ml samples) to safe levels, but it also reduced mesophilic lactococci, leuconostocs, lactobacilli, and selected enterococci (72.0%) in thermized milk. Thermization at 67 degrees C for 30 s had a major inactivation effect on all bacterial groups. Two nisin-producing L. lactis subsp. lactis strains (M78 and M104) were isolated from raw milk, but neither nisin-producing nor other bacteriocin-producing LAB strains were isolated from thermized milk. Thus, thermization treatments control harmful bacteria but also may have a negative impact on milk quality by reducing desirable LAB and the biodiversity of raw milk bacteria overall, inactivating potentially protective LAB strains and enhancing the ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci to grow in fresh cheese curds.
TI  - Characterization of a small erythromycin resistance plasmid pLFE1 from the food-isolate Lactobacillus plantarum M345.
AB  - This paper reports the complete 4031 bp nucleotide sequence of the small erythromycin resistance plasmid pLFE1 isolated from the raw-milk cheese isolate Lactobacillus plantarum M345. Analysis of the sequence revealed the coding regions for the erythromycin resistance determinant Erm(B). A replication initiation protein RepB was identified belonging to the RepB proteins of the pMV158 family of rolling-circle replicating plasmids. The transcriptional repressor protein CopG and a small counter transcribed RNA, two elements typically involved in replication control within this family were also found. A putative replication initiation site including a single-strand origin (sso) -like region succeeded by a characteristic pMV158 family double-strand origin (dso) was located upstream of the replication region. An open reading frame following a typical origin of transfer (oriT) site and coding for a putative truncated mobilization (Mob) protein with a size of 83 aa was detected. The product of the putative mob gene showed large similarity to the N-terminal region of the pMV158 family of Pre/Mob proteins, but was much smaller than other proteins of this family. We therefore suggest that the Mob function in pLFE1 is supplied in trans from another plasmid present in L. plantarum M345.Filter-mating experiments showed that pLFE1 has a broad host-range with transconjugants obtained from Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, Listeria innocua, the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis and the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - Genome-scale model of Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 for metabolic comparison of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this report, we describe the amino acid metabolism and amino acid dependency of the dairy bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 and compare them with those of two other characterized lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. Through the construction of a genome-scale metabolic model of S. thermophilus, the metabolic differences between the three bacteria were visualized by direct projection on a metabolic map. The comparative analysis revealed the minimal amino acid auxotrophy (only histidine and methionine or cysteine) of S. thermophilus LMG18311 and the broad variety of volatiles produced from amino acids compared to the other two bacteria. It also revealed the limited number of pyruvate branches, forcing this strain to use the homofermentative metabolism for growth optimization. In addition, some industrially relevant features could be identified in S. thermophilus, such as the unique pathway for acetaldehyde (yogurt flavor) production and the absence of a complete pentose phosphate pathway.
TI  - Characterization of Rhamnosidases from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus  acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacilli are known to use plant materials as a food source. Many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. Therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. In the genome of Lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram1(Lp) and ram2(Lp)) were identified, while in Lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (ramA(La)). Gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into Escherichia coli and were then tested for their enzymatic properties. Ram1(Lp), Ram2(Lp), and RamA(La) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while RamA(La) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. Subsequently, the potential application of Lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, tomato pulp. Recombinant Ram1(Lp) and RamA(La) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the tomato pulp to pH 6. The potential of Ram1(Lp) for fermentation of plant flavonoids was further investigated by expression in the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis. This system was used for fermentation of tomato pulp, with the aim of improving the bioavailability of flavonoids in processed tomato products. While import of flavonoids into L. lactis appeared to be a limiting factor, rhamnose removal was confirmed, indicating that rhamnosidase-producing bacteria may find commercial application, depending on the technological properties of the strains and enzymes.
TI  - Volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC55730 and L. reuteri BR11), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC4797, L. plantarum ATCC14917 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. Volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (SPME/GC/PFPD). Several VSCs were identified including H(2)S, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. The VSC profiles varied substantially for different strains of L. plantarum and L. reuteri and it was found that L. reuteri ATCC55730 and L. lactis MG1363 produced the lowest levels of VSCs (P < 0.05). Levels of VSCs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found in commercial cheeses. CONCLUSIONS: Several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of VSCs and substantial variations in VSC generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.
TI  - Polyphasic study of microbial communities of two Spanish farmhouse goats' milk cheeses from Sierra de Aracena.
AB  - The microbial communities present in 2 different types of farmhouse goats' milk cheese from the Aracena mountains (southwest Spain), Quesailla Arochena (hard cheese) and Torta Arochena (soft cheese), have been studied using both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. All bacterial isolates were clustered by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR. Thus a total of 26 different species were identified, the majority belonging to the lactic-acid bacteria (LAB), mainly represented by Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus species such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paracasei, together with a significant proportion of enterococci. Amongst the non-lactic-acid bacteria (NLAB), which represented 37% of the isolates in Torta Arochena, enterobacteria were the most important, Hafnia alvei and Serratia liquefaciens being the predominant species in Quesailla Arochena and Torta Arochena respectively. Moreover, RAPD analysis of the isolates revealed that most of the genotypes were specific to one of the cheeses, although a few genotypes common to both cheeses were found. The culture-independent study carried out by temporal-temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) with 2 target genes, rRNA 16S and rpoB, revealed less species diversity but L. lactis and Lb. plantarum were also predominant. Nevertheless, TTGE carried out using RNAr 16S also detected some organisms that had not been isolated by the culture-dependent method, such as Leuconostoc lactis and Mycoplasma agalactie in Quesailla Arochena. Although TTGE of the rpoB gene revealed less species diversity, it did lead to the detection of previously non-isolated species, such as Ln. lactis in Quesailla Arochena. Apart from this, the fingerprinting of Lactobacillus populations by length-heterogeneity PCR showed the predominance of the Lb. plantarum group, followed by Lactobacillus curvatus and, in smaller quantities, Lb. paracasei in Torta Arochena. From our results we may conclude that both types of methods complement each other and offer a more complete vision of the microbial diversity of these ecosystems.
TI  - Antifungal activity of strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a semolina ecosystem against Penicillium roqueforti, Aspergillus niger and Endomyces fibuliger contaminating bakery products.
AB  - Thirty samples of Italian durum wheat semolina and whole durum wheat semolina, generally used for the production of Southern Italy's traditional breads, were subjected to microbiological analysis in order to explore their lactic acid bacteria (LAB) diversity and to find strains with antifungal activity. A total of 125 presumptive LAB isolates (Gram-positive and catalase-negative) were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (REP-PCR) and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, leading to the identification of the following species: Weissella confusa, Weissella cibaria, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus rossiae and Lactobacillus plantarum. The REP-PCR results delineated 17 different patterns whose cluster analysis clearly differentiated W. cibaria from W. confusa isolates. Seventeen strains, each characterized by a different REP-PCR pattern, were screened for their antifungal properties. They were grown in a flour-based medium, comparable to a real food system, and the resulting fermentation products (FPs) were tested against fungal species generally contaminating bakery products, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium roqueforti and Endomyces fibuliger. The results of the study indicated a strong inhibitory activity - comparable to that obtained with the common preservative calcium propionate (0.3% w/v) - of ten LAB strains against the most widespread contaminant of bakery products, P. roqueforti. The screening also highlighted the unexplored antifungal activity of L. citreum, L. rossiae and W. cibaria (1 strain), which inhibited all fungal strains to the same or a higher extent compared with calcium propionate. The fermentation products of these three strains were characterized by low pH values, and a high content of lactic and acetic acids.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Bulgarian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. METHOD AND RESULTS: Seven LAB strains [Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (PC5), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (BB18), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (BCM5, BK15), Enterococcus faecium (MH3), Lactobacillus plantarum (BR12), Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (BCZ2)], isolated from authentic Bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. The bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees C for 15 min, stable at pH 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. Two of bacteriocins produced by Lact. bulgaricus BB18 (bulgaricin BB18) and E. faecium MH3 (enterocin MH3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin BB18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus bulgaricus BB18 and E. faecium MH3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. Furthermore, bulgaricin BB18 strongly inhibits Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Taxonomic structure and monitoring of the dominant population of lactic acid bacteria during wheat flour sourdough type I propagation using Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis starters.
AB  - The structure and stability of the dominant lactic acid bacterium population were assessed during wheat flour sourdough type I propagation by using singly nine strains of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. Under back-slopping propagation with wheat flour type 0 F114, cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied slightly between and within starters. As determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR and restriction endonuclease analysis-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses, only three (LS8, LS14, and LS44) starters dominated throughout 10 days of propagation. The others progressively decreased to less than 3 log CFU g(-1). Partial sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and recA genes and PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis analysis using the rpoB gene allowed identification of Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus spp. as the dominant species of the raw wheat flour. At the end of propagation, one autochthonous strain of L. sanfranciscensis was found in all the sourdoughs. Except for L. brevis, strains of the above species were variously found in the mature sourdoughs. Persistent starters were found in association with other biotypes of L. sanfranciscensis and with W. confusa or L. plantarum. Sourdoughs were characterized for acidification, quotient of fermentation, free amino acids, and community-level catabolic profiles by USING Biolog 96-well Eco microplates. In particular, catabolic profiles of sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and were clearly differentiated from the others. The three persistent starters were further used for the production of sourdoughs and propagated by using another wheat flour whose lactic acid bacterium population in part differed from the previous one. Also, in this case all three starter strains persisted during propagation.
TI  - Rep-PCR characterization and biochemical selection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the Delta area of Egypt.
AB  - Samples of raw milk and traditional dairy products were collected from different  rural areas in the Delta region. 170 isolates from these products were identified using repetitive genomic element-PCR (Rep-PCR) fingerprinting. The identified isolates were tested for efficiency of biomass production and separation, acidifying activity, autolytic and aminopeptidase properties, antagonistic activities and exopolysaccharide production. The obtained results revealed that the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the predominant species in Egyptian dairy products. Two percent of Lactococcus, 10% of Lactobacillus and 1% of Enterococcus isolates showed fast acidifying activity. Aminopeptidase and autolytic properties were generally higher for most Lactobacillus strains when compared to other strains. Among these species, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei was the highest in Aminopeptidase activity and autolytic properties. Antagonistic activity was detected in 40% of Lactococcus, 70% of Lactobacillus and 50% of Enterococcus isolates. Some isolates produced exopolysaccharides in milk and dairy products.
TI  - Effect of a reactive oxygen species-generating system for control of airborne microorganisms in a meat-processing environment.
AB  - The effectiveness of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating AirOcare equipment  on the reduction of airborne bacteria in a meat-processing environment was determined. Serratia marcescens and lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum) were used to artificially contaminate the air via a six-jet Collison nebulizer. Air in the meat-processing room was sampled immediately after aerosol generation and at various predetermined times at multiple locations by using a Staplex 6 stage air sampler. Approximately a 4-log reduction of the aerial S. marcescens population was observed within 2 h of treatment (P < 0.05) compared to a 1-log reduction in control samples. The S. marcescens populations reduced further by approximately 4.5 log after 24 h of exposure to ROS treatment. Approximately 3-log CFU/m3 reductions in lactic acid bacteria were observed following 2-h ROS exposure. Further ROS exposure reduced lactic acid bacteria in the air; however, the difference in their survival after 24 h of exposure was not significantly different from that observed with the control treatment. S. marcescens bacteria were more sensitive to ROS treatment than the lactic acid bacteria. These findings reveal that ROS treatment using the AirOcare unit significantly reduces airborne S. marcescens and lactic acid bacteria in meat-processing environments within 2 h.
TI  - A survey of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from Serbian artisanal dairy product kajmak.
AB  - Kajmak is an artisanal Serbian dairy product made by fermentation of milk fat. Overall, 374 bacterial isolates were collected from six kajmak samples of different ages produced in the households located in distinct regions of Serbia. In order to identify lactic acid bacteria present in chosen samples of kajmak, total 349 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were analyzed. The recognition of isolates was performed by phenotypic characterization followed by molecular identification using (GTG)(5)-PCR and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Enterococcus faecium were the most frequently isolated species from kajmak samples. In contrast, leuconostocs and enterococci were found in BGMK3 and BGMK1 kajmak respectively, only after using enrichment technique for isolation suggesting they are present in low numbers in these kajmaks. Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis and Lactococcus garvieae were also found in those samples but in lower proportion. Results showed that Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. paracasei and Lb. kefiri were the most frequently isolated Lactobacillus species in analyzed kajmaks.
TI  - Biodiversity of the microbial community in a Spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - The microbial diversity within Alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the Alpujarra mountains (Granada, south-east Spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community DNA. A collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analyses. Isolates on Man-Rogosa and Sharpe-agar (MRS), M17-glucose agar and Kenner Fecal (KF)-agar medium were identified by specific PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. The predominant genus was Lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being Lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of Lb. plantarum and Lb. brevis. Other lactic-acid bacteria identified were Pediococcus urinaequi, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuc. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci Enterococcus faecium and E. devriesei. Cluster analyses of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. The Gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to Hafnia alvei species. The microbes occurring in Alberquilla cheese were also studied by PCR temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of the 16S rRNA V3 region and partial 16S rRNA sequencing of the TTGE bands. The results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to Lc. lactis, Lb. paracasei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. acidophilus and Enterococcus sp. The non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as Escherichia coli. All the Enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaAfm. On the basis of their antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of Ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin B105 and mesenterocin Y105, as revealed by PCR techniques.
TI  - Polyphasic approach to bacterial dynamics during the ripening of Spanish farmhouse cheese, using culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  - We studied the dynamics of the microbial population during ripening of Cueva de la Magaha cheese using a combination of classical and molecular techniques. Samples taken during ripening of this Spanish goat's milk cheese in which Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures were analyzed. All bacterial isolates were clustered by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, species-specific PCR, and multiplex PCR. Our results indicate that the majority of the 225 strains isolated and enumerated on solid media during the ripening period were nonstarter lactic acid bacteria, and Lactobacillus paracasei was the most abundant species. Other Lactobacillus species, such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri, were also detected at the beginning and end of ripening, respectively. Non-lactic-acid bacteria, mainly Kocuria and Staphylococcus strains, were also detected at the end of the ripening period. Microbial community dynamics determined by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise estimate of the distribution of bacteria and enabled us to detect Lactobacillus curvatus and the starter bacteria S. thermophilus and L. lactis, which were not isolated. Surprisingly, the bacterium most frequently found using culture-dependent analysis, L. paracasei, was scarcely detected by this molecular approach. Finally, we studied the composition of the lactobacilli and their evolution by using length heterogeneity PCR.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plca36 isolated from Lactobacillus casei  Zhang.
AB  - The complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from Lactobacillus casei Zhang  was determined. Plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. For the first time, we identified a relBE toxin-antitoxin (TA) locus in a Lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. A region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. The cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pWCFS103 and pMRC01 from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. Comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus Lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. In addition, two chromosome-encoded relBE systems in Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus gasseri were identified.
TI  - Effect of specific colostral antibodies and selected lactobacilli on the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori on AGS cells and the Helicobacter-induced IL-8 production.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of gastritis, gastric ulcer and adenocarcinoma. It has proven difficult to cure because of its capability to develop strains resistant to antibiotics. The effect of three strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bovine colostral preparations on the adhesion of H. pylori NCTC 11637 on gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells and on the interleukin (IL)-8 production was studied. Before infection, H. pylori were pretreated with Lactobacillus plantarum MLBPL1, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactococcus lactis, or with a colostral preparation with or without specific H. pylori antibodies. The relative number of H. pylori adhered on AGS cells was determined by urease test. IL-8 produced by the cells was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Colostral preparations with and without specific antibodies reduced the adhesion of H. pylori on AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. Live LAB at a concentration of 10(10) CFU/ml reduced the adhesion by approximately 50% (P < 0.05). After the infection of AGS cells by H. pylori, the IL-8 level rose up to about 10-fold (5500 +/- 1600 pg/ml). Pretreatment of H. pylori with colostral preparations or high concentrations of LAB prevented this IL-8 rise. Similar effect was seen with live and heat-killed LAB, the live LAB being more effective. Heat-killed LAB at a concentration of 10(10) CFU/ml rose the IL-8 level of non-infected cells significantly. Suppression of IL-8 production by LAB or colostral products could have a suppressive effect on inflammation in Helicobacter infection.
TI  - Microflora of Feta cheese from four Greek manufacturers.
AB  - The components of the microflora of four Feta cheeses, produced by different Greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. Isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and then representatives of each DGGE group were sequenced for identification purposes. DNA and RNA, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to PCR-DGGE. Moreover, Feta cheeses were subjected to FISH analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. The microbial ecology, as represented by the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. The main LAB species isolated were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis and Lactobacillus fermentum. However, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. In the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by PCR-DGGE compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia fermentans and C. zeylanoides. FISH analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus spp. RAPD-PCR performed on the L. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.
TI  - Functional analysis of four bile salt hydrolase and penicillin acylase family members in Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.
AB  - Bile salts play an important role in the digestion of lipids in vertebrates and are synthesized and conjugated to either glycine or taurine in the liver. Following secretion of bile salts into the small intestine, intestinal microbes are capable of deconjugating the glycine or taurine from the bile salts, using an enzyme called bile salt hydrolase (Bsh). Intestinal lactobacilli are regarded as major contributors to bile salt hydrolysis in vivo. Since the bile salt-hydrolyzing strain Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was predicted to carry four bsh genes (bsh1, bsh2, bsh3, and bsh4), the functionality of these bsh genes was explored using Lactococcus lactis heterologous overexpression and multiple bsh deletion strains. Thus, Bsh1 was shown to be responsible for the majority of Bsh activity in L. plantarum WCFS1. In addition, bsh1 of L. plantarum WCFS1 was shown to be involved in conferring tolerance to specific bile salts (i.e., glycocholic acid). Northern blot analysis established that bsh1, bsh2, bsh3, and bsh4 are all expressed in L. plantarum WCFS1 during the exponential growth phase. Following biodiversity analysis, bsh1 appeared to be the only bsh homologue that was variable among L. plantarum strains; furthermore, the presence of bsh1 correlated with the presence of Bsh activity, suggesting that Bsh1 is commonly responsible for Bsh activity in L. plantarum strains. The fact that bsh2, bsh3, and bsh4 genes appeared to be conserved among L. plantarum strains suggests an important role of these genes in the physiology and lifestyle of the species L. plantarum. Analysis of these additional bsh-like genes in L. plantarum WCFS1 suggests that they might encode penicillin acylase rather than Bsh activity, indicating their implication in the conversion of substrates other than bile acids in the natural habitat.
TI  - Genetic modification of Lactobacillus plantarum by heterologous gene integration  in a not functional region of the chromosome.
AB  - This report describes the vector-free engineering of Lactobacillus plantarum by chromosomal integration of an exogenous gene without inactivation of physiological traits. The integrative plasmid vector pP7B6 was derived from pGIP73 by replacing the cbh site, encoding the L. plantarum conjugated bile salt hydrolase, with the prophage fragment P7B6, from L. plantarum Lp80 (DSM 4229). Plasmid pP7B6NI was obtained by inserting the nisin immunity gene nisI of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DSM 20729, preceded by the constitutive promoter P32 from the same strain, in a unique XbaI site of fragment P7B6 and was used to electrotransform L. plantarum Lp80. A food grade recombinant L. plantarum Lp80NI, with 480-fold higher immunity to nisin than the wild type, was derived by integration of pP7B6NI followed by the excision of pP7B6. Polymerase chain reaction tests demonstrated that the integration of nisI in the prophage region had occurred and that the erythromycin resistance marker from pP7B6 was lost. Fifteen among 31 L. plantarum strains tested hybridized with P7B6, indicating that the integration of pP7B6-derived vectors might occur in some other L. plantarum strains. This was experimentally confirmed by constructing the recombinant strain L. plantarum LZNI from the dairy isolate L. plantarum LZ (LMG 24600).
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. LAB mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. Two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five ATCC reference Lactobacillus strains. Thirty six isolates showed activity in the agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. However, only six cell free supernatants (CFS) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. L. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas L. plantarum and L. fermentum were the most resistant ones. Identification by MIDI system indicated that these LAB isolates were Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus casei GC subgroup A. The antagonistic factors produced by most of these LAB against L. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees C for 10 min) and stable over a wide pH range (4.0 to 9.0). These data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.
TI  - Microbial dynamics of Castelmagno PDO, a traditional Italian cheese, with a focus on lactic acid bacteria ecology.
AB  - The dynamics of dominant microflora throughout the manufacture and ripening processes were evaluated in three batches of traditional Castelmagno PDO cheese. Milk, curd and cheese samples, at different stages during cheesemaking, were collected and subjected to culture-dependent and -independent analysis. Traditional plating and genetic identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates, and PCR-DGGE analysis of V1 region of 16S rRNA gene were carried out. The collected samples were also monitored by HPLC for the presence of organic acids, sugars and ketones. LAB resulted to be the prevailing microflora in all production stages although enterococci, coagulase-negative cocci and yeasts also showed considerable viable counts probably related to the presence, in the dairy samples analysed, of free short-chain fatty acids detected by HPLC. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the species most frequently isolated during Castelmagno PDO manufacture, while Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paracasei were isolated with the highest frequencies from ripened Castelmagno PDO cheese samples. Occasionally strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens and Lactobacillus casei were isolated. The results obtained on Castelmagno PDO microflora underlines a partial correspondence between culture-dependent method and DGGE analysis. Thus, in this study, it is highlighted once more the importance to combine molecular culture-independent approaches with classical microbiological methods for the study of complex environmental communities occurring in food matrices.
TI  - Influence of selected lab cultures on the evolution of free amino acids, free fatty acids and Fiore Sardo cheese microflora during the ripening.
AB  - Fiore Sardo Protected Denomination of Origin is a traditional Sardinian (Italy) hard cheese produced exclusively from whole raw ovine milk and coagulated with lamb rennet paste. Currently, Fiore Sardo is still produced by shepherds at the farmhouse level without the addition of any starter culture and the cheese-making process is characterized by significant waste. The first objective of the present work was to investigate the autochthonous microflora present in milk and Fiore Sardo cheese in order to select lactic acid bacterial (LAB) cultures with suitable cheese-making attributes and, possibly reduce the production waste. Secondly, the ability of selected cultures to guarantee cheese healthiness and quality was tested in experimental cheese-making trials. In this study, we show that the typical lactic microflora of raw ewe's milk and Fiore Sardo cheese is mostly composed of mesophilic LAB such as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei. Moreover, strains belonging to the species were selected for cheese-making attributes and used in experimental cheese-making trials carried out in different farms producing Fiore Sardo. The evolution of the cheese microflora, free amino acids and free fatty acids during the ripening showed that the experimental cheeses were characterized by a balanced ratio of the chemical constituents, by a reduced number of spoilage microorganisms and, remarkably, by the absence of production waste that were significant for the control cheeses.
TI  - Bioprotection of Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. Eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing and API 50CH. Most of them pertained to Leuconostoc spp. and Lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to Weissella spp. and Lactococcus lactis. Growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. The strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. Treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced the cell count of S. typhimurium and E .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of L. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. Results support the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.
TI  - System using tandem repeats of the cA peptidoglycan-binding domain from Lactococcus lactis for display of both N- and C-terminal fusions on cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the C terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (cA domain) of AcmA (a major autolysin from Lactococcus lactis). Western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (cA-AmyA) of the cA domain and alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 (AmyA) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of L. lactis cells. AmyA was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. Moreover, with an increase in the number of cA domains, the quantity of cA-AmyA fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. When three repeats of the cA domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. The raw starch-degrading activity of AmyA was significantly higher when AmyA was fused to the C terminus of the cA domain than when it was fused to the N terminus. In addition, cA-AmyA fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Method for reliable isolation of Lactobacillus sakei strains originating from Tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  - In Tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. Such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. We isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of Tunisia, and selectively searched for Lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. Eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. Several methods were used in order to develop a rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of L. sakei. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. Search for the presence of the L. sakei specific katA gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ARDRA group. Sequencing of 16S rDNA confirmed those isolates as L. sakei. Those 22 different L. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ARDRA groups were tentatively ascribed to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis/garviae, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus parauberis, Hafnia alvei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus curvatus through 16S rDNA sequencing. A fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate L. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Zlatar cheese.
AB  - AIMS: Isolation, characterization and identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from artisanal Zlatar cheese during the ripening process and selection of strains with good technological characteristics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Characterization of LAB was performed based on morphological, physiological and biochemical assays, as well as, by determining proteolytic activity and plasmid profile. rep-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing were used for the identification of LAB. PCR analysis was performed with specific primers for detection of the gene encoding nisin production. Strains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were the main groups present in the Zlatar cheese during ripening. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal changes in the species were observed during the Zlatar cheese ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli are predominant microflora in Zlatar cheese. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study we determined that Zlatar cheese up to 30 days old could be used as a source of strains for the preparation of potential starter cultures in the process of industrial cheese production. As the Serbian food market is adjusting to European Union regulations, the standardization of Zlatar cheese production by using starter culture(s) based on autochtonous well-characterized LAB will enable the industrial production of this popular cheese in the future.
TI  - Characterization of the structural gene encoding nisin F, a new lantibiotic produced by a Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate from freshwater catfish (Clarias gariepinus).
AB  - Lactococcus lactis F10, isolated from freshwater catfish, produces a bacteriocin  (BacF) active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The operon encoding BacF is located on a plasmid. Sequencing of the structural gene revealed no homology to other nisin genes. Nisin F is described.
TI  - Characterization and selection of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Iberian dry-fermented salchichon and chorizo sausages.
AB  - A total of 192 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 2 types of naturally fermented dry sausages at 3 different stages of the ripening process in order to select the most suitable strains as starter cultures in dry-cured sausage manufacture according to their technological characteristics such as glucose fermentation, lactic and acetic acid production, and proteolytic, lipolytic, and antimicrobial activities. Identification of the isolates revealed that 31.2% were Pediococcus pentosaceus, 26.9% Lactococcus lactis, 18.6% Pediococcus acidilactici, 17% Lactobacillus brevis, and sporadic isolates of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus curvatus. Most of the strains did not produce gas from glucose and showed the capacity to produce lactic acid rapidly. Some 25% of the strains were able to degrade tributyrin (esterase activity), but none showed lipolytic activity against olive oil and pork fat. Only 3 strains of P. acidilactici showed weak proteolytic activity against myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic proteins. Also, the same strains showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes. Nine strains with the best properties were preselected and tested for biogenic amine production. The results showed that two of the strains, identified as P. acidilactici by polymerase chain reaction, had the potential to be further tested as starter cultures in pilot processing of Iberian sausages.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid by lactic acid bacteria isolated from a variety of Italian cheeses.
AB  - The concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in 22 Italian cheese varieties that differ in several technological traits markedly varied from 0.26 to 391 mg kg(-1). Presumptive lactic acid bacteria were isolated from each cheese variety (total of 440 isolates) and screened for the capacity to synthesize GABA. Only 61 isolates showed this activity and were identified by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Twelve species were found. Lactobacillus paracasei PF6, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus PR1, Lactococcus lactis PU1, Lactobacillus plantarum C48, and Lactobacillus brevis PM17 were the best GABA-producing strains during fermentation of reconstituted skimmed milk. Except for L. plantarum C48, all these strains were isolated from cheeses with the highest concentrations of GABA. A core fragment of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) DNA was isolated from L. paracasei PF6, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus PR1, L. lactis PU1, and L. plantarum C48 by using primers based on two highly conserved regions of GAD. A PCR product of ca. 540 bp was found for all the strains. The amino acid sequences deduced from nucleotide sequence analysis showed 98, 99, 90, and 85% identity to GadB of L. plantarum WCFS1 for L. paracasei PF6, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus PR1, L. lactis PU1, and L. plantarum C48, respectively. Except for L. lactis PU1, the three lactobacillus strains survived and synthesized GABA under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The findings of this study provide a potential basis for exploiting selected cheese-related lactobacilli to develop health-promoting dairy products enriched in GABA.
TI  - Influence of the route of immunization and the nature of the bacterial vector on  immunogenicity of mucosal vaccines based on lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Mucosal immunity plays a major role in the prevention of infectious diseases. Genetically engineered lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been tested in the last 10 years as safe mucosal delivery vectors. We previously showed that intranasal co-administration of recombinant lactococci displaying human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen at its surface (LL-E7) and secreting biologically active interleukine-12 (LL-IL-12) has therapeutic effects on HPV-16-induced tumors in mice. In this work, to optimize the immunization protocol, a comparison between intragastric and intranasal routes of administration was performed and two different LAB strains (Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum) were tested as delivery vector. E7-specific systemic and mucosal responses as well as potent anti-tumor effects were higher after intranasal immunization with LL-E7 and LL-IL-12 strains than intragastric administration. Comparisons of the immune responses induced by intranasal administration of either LL-E7 or Lb. plantarum anchoring E7 antigen (LP-E7) revealed highest systemic responses with recombinant Lactobacillus. Furthermore, although only a modest mucosal immune response was observed with LP-E7, this strain was able to induce a significant regression of HPV-induced tumors in contrast to LL-E7. Taken together, our results demonstrate the advantage of intranasal over intragastric route of immunization to induce an antigen-specific immune response and suggest that intrinsic immunomodulatory properties of Lb. plantarum play an important role in the immunogenicity of the expressed antigen.
TI  - Dominant lactic acid bacteria and their technological properties isolated from the Himalayan ethnic fermented milk products.
AB  - Ethnic people of the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, Bhutan and China consume  a variety of indigenous fermented milk products made from cows milk as well as yaks milk. These lesser-known ethnic fermented foods are dahi, mohi, chhurpi, somar, philu and shyow. The population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) ranged from 10(7) to 10(8) cfu/g in these Himalayan milk products. A total of 128 isolates of LAB were isolated from 58 samples of ethnic fermented milk products collected from different places of India, Nepal and Bhutan. Based on phenotypic characterization including API sugar test, the dominant lactic acid bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus bifermentans, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. pseudoplantarum, Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and Enterococcus faecium. LAB produced a wide spectrum of enzymes and showed high galactosidase, leucine-arylamidase and phosphatase activities. They showed antagonistic properties against selected Gram-negative bacteria. None of the strains produced bacteriocin and biogenic amines under the test conditions used. Most strains of LAB coagulated skim milk with a moderate drop in pH. Some strains of LAB showed a high degree of hydrophobicity, suggesting these strains may have useful adhesive potential. This paper is the first report on functional lactic acid bacterial composition in some lesser-known ethnic fermented milk products of the Himalayas.
TI  - Characterization of Italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  - Four Italian cheeses (Casciotta di Urbino, Barricato San Martino, Vento d'Estate, and Ubriaco di Raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. Mean values for gross composition were rather similar. Because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). Except for Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus durans/Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Weissella cibaria/Weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their origin. As shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the pH 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free AA, the secondary proteolysis of Barricato San Martino and Vento d'Estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. Purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. Vento d'Estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and Casciotta di Urbino was characterized by a very low level of volatile components. Esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. Several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for Vento d'Estate cheese. The lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in Casciotta d'Urbino, in which rennet paste was not used during manufacture. The highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in Vento d'Estate cheese.
TI  - Isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  - The transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. To determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more AR genes that encode clinically relevant ARs: tet(M), tet(O), tet(K), erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), aac (6')-Ie aph (2")-Ia, mecA, and blaZ. All of the isolates were initially tested for their AR gene profiles by PCR. The 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaZ gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the MIC, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. Lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by Lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and L. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. crispatus, and L. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. The tet(M) and erm(B) genes were the most frequently detected. Assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(M) plus erm(B) and tet(K) plus erm(B) were the most frequent AR gene patterns. Partial sequencing of the tet(M) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(M) genes previously found in human pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes and Neisseria meningitidis). Southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(M)-carrying plasmids.
TI  - Tolerance to high osmolality of the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni and identification of potential osmoprotectants.
AB  - Growth of the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni under hyperosmotic constraint was investigated in a chemically defined medium. The bacterium could grow on media with an elevated osmolality, preferably below 1.5 Osm kg(-)(1) H(2)O. At osmolalities comprised between 0.6 and 1.5 Osm kg(-)(1) H(2)O, the growth deficit elicited by the sugars glucose and fructose was slightly more severe than with salts (NaCl or KCl). In contrast to what was observed in other lactic acid bacteria, proline, glycine betaine and related molecules were unable to relieve inhibition of growth of O. oeni under osmotic constraint. This was correlated to the absence of sequences homologous to the genes coding for glycine betaine and/or proline transporters described in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. The amino acid aspartate proved to be osmoprotective under electrolyte and non-electrolyte stress. Examination of the role of peptides during osmoregulation showed that proline- and glutamate-containing peptides were protective under salt-induced stress, and not under sugar-induced stress. Under high salt, PepQ a cytoplasmic prolidase that specifically liberated proline from di-peptides increased activity, while PepX (X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase) and PepI (iminopeptidase) activities were unaffected. Our data suggest that proline- and glutamate-containing peptides may contribute to the adaptation of O. oeni to high salt through their intracellular hydrolysis and/or direct accumulation.
TI  - Influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. The major species used in dairy manufacturing are Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Leuconostoc. Traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. The appearance of the genomes of Lactococcus lactis, Bidifobacterium longum, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, 2 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of LAB. Moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. Comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different LAB in the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum for oral peptide delivery.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate strains of lactobacilli for their ability to persist and secrete heterologous protein in the oral cavity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four different strains of common oral lactobacilli, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus murinus and Lactobacillus plantarum, were transformed with the plasmid pKTH2121, which contains a secretion cassette for beta-lactamase. Lactobacilli isolated from the mouth of host mice were also transformed with pKTH2121 for later feeding. Lactococcus lactis, transformed with pKTH2121, was also fed to mice as a negative control. All transformed isolates were fed to C57Black mice in varying schedules. The number of transformed bacteria persisting in the mouth was reported as a percentage of total oral bacteria recovered by swabbing. CONCLUSIONS: The transformed L. lactis, L. brevis, L. johnsonii, L. murinus, and the endogenous murine lactobacillus strain failed to persist in the mouth. Transformed L. plantarum, however, persisted in the mouth and comprised up to 25% of the total lactobacilli at 18 h and 10% at 24 h after feeding. L. plantarum recovered after feeding retained its ability to secrete beta-lactamase into culture medium efficiently. Beta-lactamase activity could be detected in oral secretions at 8 h after feedings. After repeated feedings, however, the L. plantarum containing pKTH2121 gradually lost its ability to persist after feedings. This experiment demonstrates that L. plantarum can transiently colonize the oral mucosa in large numbers, while continuously secreting foreign proteins, raising the possibility of using lactobacilli as a vector for delivery of oral mucosal peptides.
TI  - Sequencing of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene for identification of lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the intestinal microbiota of healthy salmonids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Thirteen LAB strains were isolated from the intestinal microbiota of healthy salmonids. A approximately 500-bp region of the highly conserved 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and following this, a portion of the amplicon (272-bp) including the V1 and V2 variable regions was sequenced. The sequence containing both the V1 and V2 region provided strong evidence for the identification of LAB. The LAB strains were identified as Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The method described was found to be a very simple, rapid, specific, and low-cost tool for the identification of unknown strains of LAB.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of arginine deiminase from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis ATCC 7962 in Escherichia coli BL21.
AB  - The arcA gene that encodes arginine deiminase (ADI, EC 3.5.3.6)--a key enzyme of  the ADI pathway--was cloned from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis ATCC 7962. The deduced amino acid sequence of the arcA gene showed high homology with the arcA gene from Lactobacillus plantarum (99%) and from Lactobacillus sakei (60%), respectively. The arcA gene from Lc. lactis spp. lactis ATCC 7962 was expressed in soluble fraction of recombinant Escherichia coli BL21. ADI produced from Lc. lactis spp. lactis ATCC 7962 (LADI) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was purified using sequential Q-Sepharose anion exchange and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column chromatography. The final yield of LADI in the purification procedure was 63.5%, and the specific activity was 140.27 U/mg. The presence of purified LADI was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and determination of the molecular mass. The LADI had a molecular mass of about 140 kDa, and comprised a homotrimer of 46 kDa in the native condition. LADI exhibited only 35% amino acid sequence homology with ADI from Mycoplasma arginini. However, LADI shared a similar three dimensional structure. The K(M) and V(max) values for arginine were 8.67+/-0.045 mM (mean+/-SD) and 344.83+/-1.79 micromol/min/mg, respectively, and the optimum temperature and pH for the production of LADI were 60 degrees C and 7.2.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Improvement of an experimental colitis in rats by lactic acid bacteria producing  superoxide dismutase.
AB  - The use of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in inflammatory diseases is hampered by their short circulatory half-life. To determine whether a bacterial supply of SOD into the colon might improve an experimental colitis, the effects of oral treatment with live recombinant lactic acid bacteria producing different amounts of SOD and those of colonic infusion of SOD were compared. Wistar rats were fitted with a catheter in the proximal colon through which TNBS was administered to induce colitis. Animals received a continuous intracolonic infusion of bovine SOD (40 U per rat per day) for 4 days after TNBS or were treated orally with live recombinant Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus plantarum strains (10 colony-forming units (CFU)/d), producing or not producing SOD, for 4 days before and after TNBS. SOD activity of bacterial extracts was 0, 26, 74, and 624 units/10 CFU for L. plantarum, L. lactis, L. lactis SOD, and L. plantarum SOD, respectively. Four days after TNBS, macroscopic and microscopic damage, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and nitrotyrosine immunostaining were evaluated. TNBS induced macroscopic and microscopic damages, an increase in MPO activity, and intense immunostaining for nitrotyrosine. Macroscopic damage and MPO activity were reduced by bovine SOD. These parameters and microscopic damages also were reduced by L. lactis, L. lactis SOD, and L. plantarum SOD, but not by L. plantarum. Nitrotyrosine immunostaining was attenuated after treatment with the 4 bacterial strains. Although not all of the anti-inflammatory effects could be attributed directly to SOD, our results suggest that SOD-producing lactic acid bacteria open a novel approach in inflammatory bowel disease treatment.
TI  - Racemization of l-lactic acid in pH-swing open fermentation of kitchen refuse by  selective proliferation of Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - We have shown that stable lactic acid fermentation of model kitchen refuse occurs with intermittent pH adjustment under nonsterilized conditions. Nonetheless, the optical activity of the accumulated lactic acid was low, which is disadvantageous for the production of high-quality poly-l-lactic acid. Here, we attempt to increase optical purity by introducing l-lactic acid-producing strains under nonsterilized conditions and demonstrate that the inoculation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Lactococcus lactis, both of which are l-lactic acid producers, is partially effective in the early fermentation stage, but does not improve the final optical purity of the accumulated lactic acid. We confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using group-specific and species-specific 16S rDNA probes that this is due to the selective proliferation of naturally existing L. plantarum. L. plantarum KY-1, which is isolated from model kitchen refuse, showing lactic acid racemase activity, as well as d-lactate dehydrogenase activity, in its membrane fraction. We conclude that racemase activity associated with L. plantarum is the main cause of decreased optical purity in the accumulated lactic acid.
TI  - A food-grade expression/secretion vector for Lactococcus lactis that uses an alpha-galactosidase gene as a selection marker.
AB  - A new food-grade expression/secretion vector for lactococci, pFMN30, was developed using an alpha-galactosidase gene (melA) of Lactobacillus plantarum as a selection marker. The 4.9-kb pFMN30 is a derivative of the lactococcal vector pMG36e containing a broad-host-range replicon of pWV01. In Lactococcus lactis, transformants carrying the vector were easily detectable by the appearance of a blue colony on a X-alpha-gal-containing medium and also by the growth on a medium containing melibiose as a sole carbon source. The expression/secretion vector was equipped with the controllable and strong nisA promoter. In addition, usp45 signal peptide was inserted for the efficient secretion of a foreign protein outside cells. The vector pFMN30 was used for the expression and secretion of alpha-amylase as a reporter gene, lacking a signal sequence derived from Bacillus licheniformis in L. lactis. These results show that the food-grade expression/secretion vector constructed in the present study could be used for the production of foreign proteins in L. lactis for the production food materials and also for the medicinal purposes.
TI  - Production of a heterologous nonheme catalase by Lactobacillus casei: an efficient tool for removal of H2O2 and protection of Lactobacillus bulgaricus from oxidative stress in milk.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally sensitive to H2O2, a compound that they  can paradoxically produce themselves, as is the case for Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14431 is one of the very few LAB strains able to degrade H2O2 through the action of a nonheme, manganese-dependent catalase (hereafter called MnKat). The MnKat gene was expressed in three catalase-deficient LAB species: L. bulgaricus ATCC 11842, Lactobacillus casei BL23, and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. While the protein could be detected in all heterologous hosts, enzyme activity was observed only in L. casei. This is probably due to the differences in the Mn contents of the cells, which are reportedly similar in L. plantarum and L. casei but at least 10- and 100-fold lower in Lactococcus lactis and L. bulgaricus, respectively. The expression of the MnKat gene in L. casei conferred enhanced oxidative stress resistance, as measured by an increase in the survival rate after exposure to H2O2, and improved long-term survival in aerated cultures. In mixtures of L. casei producing MnKat and L. bulgaricus, L. casei can eliminate H2O2 from the culture medium, thereby protecting both L. casei and L. bulgaricus from its deleterious effects.
TI  - Resident lactic acid bacteria in raw milk Canestrato Pugliese cheese.
AB  - AIMS: Investigation of the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) population of the raw milk protected designation of origin Canestrato Pugliese cheese using phenotypic and genotypic methodologies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty phenotypic assays and three molecular techniques (restriction fragment length polymorphism, partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and recA multiplex PCR assay) were applied to the identification of 304 isolates from raw milk Canestrato Pugliese cheese. As a result, 168 of 207 isolates identified were ascribed to genus Enterococcus, 25 to Lactobacillus, 13 to Lactococcus and one to Leuconostoc. More in details among the lactobacilli, the species Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum were predominant, including 13 and 10 isolates respectively, whereas among the lactococci, Lactococcus lactis subsp.cremoris [corrected] was the species more frequently detected (seven isolates). CONCLUSIONS: Except for the enterococci, phenotypic tests were not reliable enough for the identification of the isolates, if not combined to the genotype-based molecular techniques. The polyphasic approach utilized allowed 10 different LAB species to be detected; thus suggesting the appreciable LAB diversity of the autochthonous microbial population of the Canestrato Pugliese cheese. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A comprehensive study of the resident raw milk Canestrato Pugliese cheese microbial population has been undertaken.
TI  - Modulation of allergic immune responses by mucosal application of recombinant lactic acid bacteria producing the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are able to modulate the host immune system and clinical trials have demonstrated that specific strains have the capacity to reduce allergic symptoms. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the potential of recombinant LAB producing the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 for mucosal vaccination against birch pollen allergy. METHODS: Recombinant Bet v 1-producing Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis strains were constructed. Their immunogenicity was compared with purified Bet v 1 by subcutaneous immunization of mice. Intranasal application of the live recombinant strains was performed to test their immunomodulatory potency in a mouse model of birch pollen allergy. RESULTS: Bet v 1 produced by the LAB was recognized by monoclonal anti-Bet v 1 and IgE antibodies from birch pollen-allergic patients. Systemic immunization with the recombinant strains induced significantly lower IgG1/IgG2a ratios compared with purified Bet v 1. Intranasal pretreatment led to reduced allergen-specific IgE vs enhanced IgG2a levels and reduced interleukin (IL)-5 production of splenocytes in vitro, indicating a shift towards non-allergic T-helper-1 (Th1) responses. Airway inflammation, i.e. eosinophils and IL-5 in lung lavages, was reduced using either Bet v 1-producing or control strains. Allergen-specific secretory IgA responses were enhanced in lungs and intestines after pretreatment with only the Bet v 1-producing strains. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal vaccination with live recombinant LAB, leading to a shift towards non-allergic immune responses along with enhanced allergen-specific mucosal IgA levels offers a promising approach to prevent systemic and local allergic immune responses.
TI  - Accelerating the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genomic information of a species allows for the genome-scale reconstruction of its metabolic capacity. Such a metabolic reconstruction gives support to metabolic engineering, but also to integrative bioinformatics and visualization. Sequence-based automatic reconstructions require extensive manual curation, which can be very time-consuming. Therefore, we present a method to accelerate the time-consuming process of network reconstruction for a query species. The method exploits the availability of well-curated metabolic networks and uses high-resolution predictions of gene equivalency between species, allowing the transfer of gene-reaction associations from curated networks. RESULTS: We have evaluated the method using Lactococcus lactis IL1403, for which a genome-scale metabolic network was published recently. We recovered most of the gene-reaction associations (i.e. 74 - 85%) which are incorporated in the published network. Moreover, we predicted over 200 additional genes to be associated to reactions, including genes with unknown function, genes for transporters and genes with specific metabolic reactions, which are good candidates for an extension to the previously published network. In a comparison of our developed method with the well-established approach Pathologic, we predicted 186 additional genes to be associated to reactions. We also predicted a relatively high number of complete conserved protein complexes, which are derived from curated metabolic networks, illustrating the potential predictive power of our method for protein complexes. CONCLUSION: We show that our methodology can be applied to accelerate the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks by taking optimal advantage of existing, manually curated networks. As orthology detection is the first step in the method, only the translated open reading frames (ORFs) of a newly sequenced genome are necessary to reconstruct a metabolic network. When more manually curated metabolic networks will become available in the near future, the usefulness of our method in network prediction is likely to increase.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Lipid II-based antimicrobial activity of the lantibiotic plantaricin C.
AB  - We analyzed the mode of action of the lantibiotic plantaricin C (PlnC), produced  by Lactobacillus plantarum LL441. Compared to the well-characterized type A lantibiotic nisin and type B lantibiotic mersacidin, which are both able to interact with the cell wall precursor lipid II, PlnC displays structural features of both prototypes. In this regard, we found that lipid II plays a key role in the antimicrobial activity of PlnC besides that of pore formation. The pore forming activity of PlnC in whole cells was prevented by shielding lipid II on the cell surface. However, in contrast to nisin, PlnC was not able to permeabilize Lactococcus lactis cells or to form pores in 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liposomes supplemented with 0.1 mol% purified lipid II. This emphasized the different requirements of these lantibiotics for pore formation. Using cell wall synthesis assays, we identified PlnC as a potent inhibitor of (i) lipid II synthesis and (ii) the FemX reaction, i.e., the addition of the first Gly to the pentapeptide side chain of lipid II. As revealed by thin-layer chromatography, both reactions were clearly blocked by the formation of a PlnC-lipid I and/or PlnC-lipid II complex. On the basis of the in vivo and in vitro activities of PlnC shown in this study and the structural lipid II binding motifs described for other lantibiotics, the specific interaction of PlnC with lipid II is discussed.
TI  - Induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen A.
AB  - Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.
TI  - Usefulness of length heterogeneity-PCR for monitoring lactic acid bacteria succession during maize ensiling.
AB  - The use of length-heterogeneity PCR was explored to monitor lactic acid bacteria  succession during ensiling of maize. Bacterial diversity was studied during the fermentation of 30-day-old maize in optimal and spoilage-simulating conditions. A length heterogeneity PCR profile database of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the silage and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was established. Although interoperonic 16S rRNA gene length polymorphisms were detected in some isolates, strain analysis showed that most of the lactic acid bacteria species thriving in silage could be discriminated by this method. The length heterogeneity PCR profiles of bacterial communities during maize fermentation were compared with those on a database. Under optimal fermentation conditions all the ecological indices of bacterial diversity, richness and evenness, deduced from community profiles, increased until day thirteen of fermentation and then decreased to the initial values. Pediococcus and Weissella dominated, especially in the first days of fermentation. Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus brevis were mainly found after six days of fermentation. A peak corresponding to Lactobacillus plantarum was present in all the fermentation phases, but was only a minor fraction of the population. Unsuitable fermentation conditions and withered maize leaves in the presence of oxygen and water excess caused an enrichment of Enterococcus sp. and Enterobacter sp.
TI  - Recommendations for improved use of the murine TNBS-induced colitis model in evaluating anti-inflammatory properties of lactic acid bacteria: technical and microbiological aspects.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria have been shown to exert promising beneficial effects in different types of intestinal disorders, including chronic inflammation. In this context, animal models of inflammatory bowel disease are useful in studying the possible prophylactic role of candidate probiotic strains. This study aimed at evaluating the critical technological and microbiological parameters as well as the robustness of the murine trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced model of colitis, after intragastric administration of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) preparations. A standardized methodology was applied to assess the protective effect achieved by various bacterial concentrations and culture conditions of the reference strain Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826. Not only was protection found to vary in function in different levels of colitis, but also repeated experiments showed a clear bacterial dose-dependent attenuation of colitis. The physiological stage of bacteria was shown to impact as well, with substantial, mild, or reduced improvement of inflammatory scores for exponentially growing, stationary-phase, or killed bacteria, respectively. A recombinant strain, secreting murine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and previously reported to successfully treat colitis in two different models of murine colitis (dextran sulfate sodium [DSS] and IL-10-deficient mice), was used to validate the final experimental conditions. In conclusion, we identified and optimized some of the key parameters that need to be controlled in order to ensure reliable comparison of results generated over a long period of time or independent experiments. The recommendations for an improved model presented here will prove to be helpful for reproducible, independent comparison of the anti-inflammatory potential of wild-type or recombinant candidate probiotic strains, whether administered as pure cultures or as blends.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of a novel glutamate decarboxylase gene from a newly isolated lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus brevis OPK-3.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis OPK-3, having 84.292 mg/L/h of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) productivity, was isolated from Kimchi, a traditional fermented food in Korea. A core fragment of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) DNA was isolated from the L. brevis OPK-3, using primers based on two highly conserved regions of GAD. A full-length GAD (LbGAD) clone was subsequently isolated through rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the open reading frame (ORF) consisted of 1401 bases and encoded a protein of 467 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 53.4 kDa and a pI of 5.65. The amino acid sequence deduced from LbGAD ORF showed 83%, 71%, and 60% identity to the Lactobacillus plantarum GAD, Lactococcus lactis GAD, and Listeria monocytogenes GAD sequences, respectively. The LbGAD gene was expressed in Escherichia coli strain UT481, and the extract of transformed E. coli UT481 contained an induced 53.4 kDa protein and had significantly enhanced GAD activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The expression and secretion signals of the Sep protein from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by Lb. fermentum BR11, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. The production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin Ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. Buffering of the growth media to a neutral pH allowed detection of Ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. It was found that purified Ply511 has a pH activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. Supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by approximately 8 log(10) CFU/ml compared to controls. However, supernatants containing Ply511 were unable to control L. monocytogenes growth. In coculture experiments, both Lb. plantarum and Lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce MRSA cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)CFU/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting Ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes. Our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and Ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity. Lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of S. aureus infections.
TI  - Use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  - Conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (Kohonen Self Organizing Map) and supervised (Bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus including 47 reference strains. Electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by Piraino et al. [Piraino, P., Ricciardi, A., Lanorte, M. T., Malkhazova, I., Parente, E., 2002. A new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. Biotechnol. Lett. 24, 1477-1482]. Hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (Leuconostoc, Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus, Lb. plantarum/Lb. paraplantarum, Lc. lactis/Lc. raffinolactis). A 7x7 Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. The map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. Two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 Bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of SDS-PAGE patterns of Lc. lactis from those of other species. We conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
TI  - Comparative and functional analysis of the rRNA-operons and their tRNA gene complement in different lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The complete genome sequences of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactobacillus johnsonii were used to compare location, sequence, organisation, and regulation of the ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons. All rrn operons of the examined LAB diverge from the origin of replication, which is compatible with their efficient expression. All operons show a common organisation of 5'-16S-23S-5S-3' structure, but differ in the number, location and specificity of the tRNA genes. In the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, two of the five rrn operons of Lb. plantarum and three of the six of Lb. johnsonii contain tRNA-ala and tRNA-ile genes, while L. lactis has a tRNA-ala gene in all six operons. The number of tRNA genes following the 5S rRNA gene ranges up to 14, 16, and 21 for L. lactis, Lb. johnsonii and Lb. plantarum, respectively. The tRNA gene complements are similar to each other and to those of other bacteria. Micro-heterogeneity was found within the rRNA structural genes and spacer regions of each strain. In the rrn operon promoter regions of Lb. plantarum and L. lactis marked differences were found, while the promoter regions of Lb. johnsonii showed a similar tandem promoter structure in all operons. The rrn promoters of L. lactis show either a single or a tandem promoter structure. All promoters of Lb. plantarum contain two or three -10 and -35 regions, of which either zero to two were followed by an UP-element. The Lb. plantarum rrnA, rrnB, and rrnC promoter regions display similarity to the rrn promoter structure of Esherichia coli. Differences in regulation between the five Lb. plantarum promoters were studied using a low copy promoter-probe plasmid. Taking copy number and growth rate into account, a differential expression over time was shown. Although all five Lb. plantarum rrn promoters are significantly different, this study shows that their activity was very similar under the circumstances tested. An active promoter was also identified within the Lb. plantarum rrnC operon preceding a cluster of 17 tRNA genes.
TI  - Testing of a whole genome PCR scanning approach to identify genomic variability in four different species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Genomes can be markedly heterogeneous in conspecific bacterial strains. Genome sequences can be used to analyze genome plasticity via a PCR(2) (plasticity of chromosome revealed by PCR) approach. Small-sized chromosomes can indeed be fully amplified by long-range PCR with a set of primers designed using a reference strain and then applied to several other strains. Analysis of the resulting patterns can reveal genome plasticity. GenoFrag, a software package for the design of primers optimized for PCR(2) [N. Ben Zakour, M. Gautier, R. Andonov, D. Lavenier, M.F. Cochet, P. Veber, A. Sorokin, Y. Le Loir, GenoFrag: Software to design primers optimized for whole genome scanning by long-range PCR amplification, Nucleic Acids Res. 32 (2004) 17-24] was developed for the analysis of bacterial genome plasticity by whole genome amplification in approximately 10-kb-long fragments. By applying GenoFrag, we provide herewith evidence that genome plasticity can be analyzed in lactic acid bacteria using a PCR(2) approach. The genome sequences of Lactococcus lactis IL1403, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus bulgaricus ATCC11842 and Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 were used to design four sets of primers. Each set was evaluated in silico to check that it ensured optimum coverage of the bacterial chromosome. To validate the primers generated by GenoFrag, a subset of primers was successfully used in LR-PCR experiments on genomic DNA from four L. bulgaricus strains.
TI  - Bioengineering lactic acid bacteria to secrete the HIV-1 virucide cyanovirin.
AB  - An urgent need exists to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1. With prevalence rates exceeding 35% in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, increasing attention has been placed on developing and testing microbicidal agents capable of preventing virus transmission at mucosal sites. HIV-1 microbicides must meet several requirements before their widespread use. The drugs must be able to neutralize a diversity of HIV-1 strains, not induce mucosal inflammation, be associated with minimal side effects, and be effective for a prolonged period after a single application. Recent work has demonstrated the utility of recombinant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as agents of mucosal drug delivery. Here, we describe the bioengineering of strains of LAB to secrete the prototypic virucidal compound cyanovirin (CV-N) and demonstrate the anti-HIV-1 activity of secreted CV-N. Our results suggest that recombinant LAB may serve as effective microbicidal compounds and deserve in vivo testing in simian immunodeficiency virus models of mucosal virus transmission.
TI  - Phenotypic identification and technological properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditionally processed fish products of the Eastern Himalayas.
AB  - Sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti are traditional smoked and sun-dried fish products of the Eastern Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. A total of 40 samples of sukako maacha (14), gnuchi (6), sidra (10) and sukuti (10) were collected and were analysed for microbial load. Population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as well as aerobic mesophilic counts ranged from 4.7-8.3 to 5.1-8.5 log cfu g(-1), respectively. A total of 189 strains of LAB were isolated from sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti samples, out of which 171 strains were cocci and 15 strains, were heterofermentative lactobacilli. LAB were identified on the basis of phenotypic characters including API system as Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weissella confusa. LAB strains produced a wide spectrum of enzymes. Some strains of LAB showed antagonistic properties against pathogenic strains. None of the strains produced biogenic amines in the method applied. This paper is the first report on the microbial composition, mostly lactic acid bacteria, of traditionally processed fish products of Eastern Himalayas.
TI  - Potential of functional strains, isolated from traditional Maasai milk, as starters for the production of fermented milks.
AB  - The purpose of this research was the evaluation of technological features and of  the ability of functional LAB strains with desirable sensory characteristics, to produce fermented milk. Eight strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactococcus lactis, isolated from Maasai traditional fermented milk in Kenya and previously tested for their probiotic properties, were selected for this investigation. Technological features such as growth kinetics in fresh heat-treated whole milk medium and survival in the final product during storage at 4 degrees C, were studied. The strains Lb. acidophilus BFE 6,059, Lb. paracasei BFE 5,264 and Lc. lactis BFE 6,049 showed the best potential and were thus selected for use as starter cultures in further trials with the objective to improve their technological performance and to optimise the sensory features of fermented milk obtained. The effects of fat (F), non-fat milk solids (S) and fermentation temperature (T), modulated according to a Central Composite Design, on fermentation rates and viability losses during refrigerated storage of the chosen starters, and on product texture parameters, were studied. From the data analysis, it was possible to select optimum conditions for enhancing positive sensory traits of final products and for improving the survival of these potentially probiotic cultures.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
TI  - Use of real time PCR to determine population profiles of individual species of lactic acid bacteria in alfalfa silage and stored corn stover.
AB  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. Species-specific PCR primers were designed based on recA gene sequences. Commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. Lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant LAB (12 to 32% of total sample DNA) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96 h. Modest populations (up to 10%) of Lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. Pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. Small populations (0.1 to 1%) of Lactobacillus buchneri and Lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while Lactobacillus pentosus and Enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. Corn stover generally displayed higher populations of L. plantarum and L. brevis and lower populations of other LAB species. The data illustrate the utility of RT-PCR for quantifying individual species of LAB in conserved forages prepared under a wide variety of conditions.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of a Lactobacillus plantarum double ldh knockout strain for enhanced ethanol production.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum ferments glucose through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway: the central metabolite pyruvate is converted into lactate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). By substituting LDH with pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activity, pyruvate may be redirected toward ethanol production instead of lactic acid fermentation. A PDC gene from the Gram-positive bacterium Sarcina ventriculi (Spdc) was introduced into an LDH-deficient strain, L. plantarum TF103, in which both the ldhL and ldhD genes were inactivated. Four different fusion genes between Spdc and either the S. ventriculi promoter or three Lactococcus lactis promoters in pTRKH2 were introduced into TF103. PDC activity was detected in all four recombinant strains. The engineered strains were examined for production of ethanol and other metabolites in flask fermentations. The recombinant strains grew slightly faster than the parent TF103 and produced 90-130 mM ethanol. Although slightly more ethanol was observed, carbon flow was not significantly improved toward ethanol, suggesting that a further understanding of this organism's metabolism is necessary.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Lactate racemization as a rescue pathway for supplying D-lactate to the cell wall biosynthesis machinery in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that produces d- and l-lactate using stereospecific NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenases (LdhD and LdhL, respectively). However, reduction of glycolytic pyruvate by LdhD is not the only pathway for d-lactate production since a mutant defective in this activity still produces both lactate isomers (T. Ferain, J. N. Hobbs, Jr., J. Richardson, N. Bernard, D. Garmyn, P. Hols, N. E. Allen, and J. Delcour, J. Bacteriol. 178:5431-5437, 1996). Production of d-lactate in this species has been shown to be connected to cell wall biosynthesis through its incorporation as the last residue of the muramoyl-pentadepsipeptide peptidoglycan precursor. This particular feature leads to natural resistance to high concentrations of vancomycin. In the present study, we show that L. plantarum possesses two pathways for d-lactate production: the LdhD enzyme and a lactate racemase, whose expression requires l-lactate. We report the cloning of a six-gene operon, which is involved in lactate racemization activity and is positively regulated by l-lactate. Deletion of this operon in an L. plantarum strain that is devoid of LdhD activity leads to the exclusive production of l-lactate. As a consequence, peptidoglycan biosynthesis is affected, and growth of this mutant is d-lactate dependent. We also show that the growth defect can be partially restored by expression of the d-alanyl-d-alanine-forming Ddl ligase from Lactococcus lactis, or by supplementation with various d-2-hydroxy acids but not d-2-amino acids, leading to variable vancomycin resistance levels. This suggests that L. plantarum is unable to efficiently synthesize peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-alanine and that the cell wall biosynthesis machinery in this species is specifically dedicated to the production of peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-lactate. In this context, the lactate racemase could thus provide the bacterium with a rescue pathway for d-lactate production upon inactivation or inhibition of the LdhD enzyme.
TI  - In situ activity of a bacteriocin-producing Lactococcus lactis strain. Influence  on the interactions between lactic acid bacteria during sourdough fermentation.
AB  - AIMS: To biochemically characterize the bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis M30 and demonstrate its effect on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during sourdough propagation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A two-peptide bacteriocin produced by L. lactis ssp. lactis M30 was purified by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction and reversed phase chromatography. Mass spectrometry of the two peptides and sequence analysis of the ltnA2 gene showed that the bacteriocin was almost identical to lacticin 3147. During a 20-day period of sourdough propagation the stability of L. lactis M30 was demonstrated, with concomitant inhibition of the indicator strain Lactobacillus plantarum 20, as well as the non-interference with the growth of the starter strain Lact. sanfranciscensis CB1. CONCLUSIONS: In situ active bacteriocins influence the microbial consortium of sourdough LAB and can "support" the dominance of insensitive strains during sourdough fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The in situ bacteriocinogenic activity of selected lactococci enables the persistence of insensitive Lact. sanfranciscensis strains, useful to confer good characteristics to the dough, at a higher cell concentration with respect to other LAB of the same ecosystem.
TI  - Growth of lactic acid bacteria and Rhizopus oligosporus during barley tempeh fermentation.
AB  - The zygomycete Rhizopus oligosporus is traditionally used to ferment soybean tempeh, but it is also possible to ferment other legumes and cereals to tempeh. The traditional soybean tempeh harbours a multitude of microorganisms with potentially beneficial or detrimental effects on quality. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have positive effects on the safety of soybean tempeh, but the effects of LAB on R. oligosporus growth have not been investigated. We have developed a cereal grain tempeh by fermenting pearled barley with R. oligosporus ATCC 64063. Four LAB species, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus lactis were assessed for their growth abilities and their effects on R. oligosporus growth during barley tempeh fermentation. Growth of LAB was assayed as colony forming units (cfu), while growth of R. oligosporus was measured as ergosterol content and hyphal length. The two fungal measurements highly correlated (r=0.83, P<0.001, n=90). The ergosterol content of fungal mycelia ranged from 11.7 to 30.1 mg/g fungal dry matter. L. plantarum multiplied from 4.8 to 7.4 log cfu/g dry tempeh and L. fermentum increased from 4.4 to 6.8 log cfu/g during 24 h incubation at 35 degrees C. L. reuteri and L. lactis had significantly slower growth, with increases from 4.8 to 5.6 log cfu/g and 5.0 to 5.4 log cfu/g, respectively. The growth of R. oligosporus and the final pH (4.9) in barley tempeh were not significantly influenced by any of the LAB investigated.
TI  - Use of lactic and propionic acid bacteria in the production of fermented parsley  juice.
AB  - Taking into consideration the proliferation rate of Propionibacterium sp. cells,  pH changes and sensory properties of the fermented product obtained, selection of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) was made in order to determine their usefulness for the production of fermented parsley juice. The analysis included 12 strains, belonging to the following species: P. thoenii (4 strains), P. jensenii (6 strains), P. freudenreichii (1 strain) and P. acidipropionici (1 strain). The experiments show that many strains of propionic acid rods develop well in parsley juice, allowing to achieve the desired taste qualities of the product. The Propionibacterium strains selected by elimination were used as components of vaccine containing: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - pIH01, a small cryptic plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum IH3.
AB  - A small cryptic plasmid pIH01 from Leuconostoc citreum IH3 was characterized. This 1.8-kb sized plasmid contains single open reading frame that encodes a RepC class protein (342 amino acids) and a conserved pT181-type double strand origin, suggesting a rolling circle replication mode. This putative replicase protein shows the highest similarity to a replicase from pFR18 plasmid of Leuconostoc mesenteroides FR52 (64% identity), one of the pT181-type rolling circle plasmid family and contains a strictly conserved RepC-type active site sequence of pT181 family. A shuttle vector that was developed on the basis of this cryptic plasmid by insertion of both erythromycin resistance gene (ermC) from pE194 and Escherichia coli ColE1 origin was able to transform Leuconostoc strains, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactococcus lactis. Therefore, pIH01 derivative plasmids might be useful for the manipulation of Leuconostoc strains.
TI  - Unity in organisation and regulation of catabolic operons in Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Global regulatory circuits together with more specific local regulators play a notable role when cells are adapting to environmental changes. Lactococcus lactis is a lactic acid bacterium abundant in nature fermenting most mono- and disaccharides. Comparative genomics analysis of the operons encoding the proteins and enzymes crucial for catabolism of lactose, maltose and threhalose revealed an obvious unity in operon organisation . The local regulator of each operon was located in a divergent transcriptional direction to the rest of the operon including the transport protein-encoding genes. Furthermore, in all three operons a catabolite responsive element (CRE) site was detected inbetween the gene encoding the local regulator and one of the genes encoding a sugar transport protein. It is evident that regardless of type of transport system and catabolic enzymes acting upon lactose, maltose and trehalose, respectively, Lc. lactis shows unity in both operon organisation and regulation of these catabolic operons. This knowledge was further extended to other catabolic operons in Lc. lactis and the two related bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum and Listeria monocytogenes. Thirty-nine catabolic operons responsible for degradation of sugars and sugar alcohols in Lc. lactis, Lb. plantarum and L. monocytogenes were investigated and the majority of those possessed the same organisation as the lactose, maltose and trehalose operons of Lc. lactis. Though, the frequency of CRE sites and their location varied among the bacteria. Both Lc. lactis and Lb. plantarum showed CRE sites in direct proximity to genes coding for proteins responsible for sugar uptake. However, in L. monocytogenes CRE sites were not frequently found and not in the vicinity of genes encoding transport proteins, suggesting a more local mode of regulation of the catabolic operons found and/or the use of inducer control in this bacterium.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum ccl gene is non-essential, arginine-repressed and codes for a conserved protein in Firmicutes.
AB  - Among proteins specifically found in most gram-positive bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, conserved proteins of the family pfam06177-DUF988-COG4708 are of unknown function. The citrulline cluster-linked (ccl) gene of Lactobacillus plantarum codes one such protein and is adjacent to the citrulline biosynthesis operon argCJBDF, a situation also found in Lactococcus lactis. This gene is well conserved among L. plantarum species, and 1 isolate out of 24 harbored two ccl copies. Northern hybridization with a ccl probe revealed two arginine-repressed transcripts with sizes corresponding to the predicted argCJBDF-ccl operon and the ccl gene alone. Transcription start sites of both transcripts were characterized. Four different 5' ends were mapped at the argF-ccl intergenic region, resulting from either regulated transcription initiation or maturation of the transcripts. Transcriptional ccl-gusA gene fusion confirmed the promoter activity of the argF-ccl intergenic region. Thus, the ccl gene is arginine-repressed and transcribed both monocistronically and polycistronically in the argCJBDF-ccl operon. The ccl gene is not essential in L. plantarum, because a ccl gene deletion was obtained in strain CCM 1904. Although no functions were found in the tested laboratory conditions, the Ccl-like proteins may play a role in environmental conditions of life.
TI  - Cell-surface display of E7 antigen from human papillomavirus type-16 in Lactococcus lactis and in Lactobacillus plantarum using a new cell-wall anchor from lactobacilli.
AB  - The human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 protein is considered a major viral  oncoprotein involved in cervical cancer (CxCa) and a potential candidate for the development of a vaccine against this neoplasia. Here, two lactic acid bacteria (the model one Lactococcus lactis and a probiotic one Lactobacillus plantarum) were engineered to deliver an E7 mutant protein (E7mm), which has a reduced transforming activity and consequently, could fit better to therapeutic use in humans than the native form of E7. An efficient cell-surface display of E7mm was obtained in L. lactis using an expression cassette encoding a precursor composed of (i) the signal peptide and the first 15 amino acids of the mature part of the lactococcal Usp45 protein; (ii) E7mm and (iii) the cell-wall anchor of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein (CWA(M6)). This hybrid precursor was produced but not cell-wall anchored in Lb. plantarum. We thus replaced CWA(M6) by the cell-wall anchor of a Lb. plantarum protein which allows an efficient cell-wall anchoring of E7mm in this bacterium. The E7mm production and cell-surface display in both L. lactis and a probiotic bacterium, Lb. plantarum, represent one more step towards the development of a safe and effective treatment against CxCa.
TI  - Overproduction of heterologous mannitol 1-phosphatase: a key factor for engineering mannitol production by Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - To achieve high mannitol production by Lactococcus lactis, the mannitol 1-phosphatase gene of Eimeria tenella and the mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene mtlD of Lactobacillus plantarum were cloned in the nisin-dependent L. lactis NICE overexpression system. As predicted by a kinetic L. lactis glycolysis model, increase in mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase and mannitol 1-phosphatase activities resulted in increased mannitol production. Overexpression of both genes in growing cells resulted in glucose-mannitol conversions of 11, 21, and 27% by the L. lactis parental strain, a strain with reduced phosphofructokinase activity, and a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient strain, respectively. Improved induction conditions and increased substrate concentrations resulted in an even higher glucose-to-mannitol conversion of 50% by the lactate dehydrogenase-deficient L. lactis strain, close to the theoretical mannitol yield of 67%. Moreover, a clear correlation between mannitol 1-phosphatase activity and mannitol production was shown, demonstrating the usefulness of this metabolic engineering approach.
TI  - Functional analysis of three plasmids from Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 harbors three plasmids, pWCFS101, pWCFS102, and pWCFS103, with sizes of 1,917, 2,365, and 36,069 bp, respectively. The two smaller plasmids are of unknown function and contain replication genes that are likely to function via the rolling-circle replication mechanism. The host range of the pWCFS101 replicon includes Lactobacillus species and Lactococcus lactis, while that of the pWCFS102 replicon also includes Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and Bacillus subtilis. The larger plasmid is predicted to replicate via the theta-type mechanism. The host range of its replicon seems restricted to L. plantarum. Cloning vectors were constructed based on the replicons of all three plasmids. Plasmid pWCFS103 was demonstrated to be a conjugative plasmid, as it could be transferred to L. plantarum NC8. It confers arsenate and arsenite resistance, which can be used as selective markers.
TI  - Reduction of non-digestible oligosaccharides in soymilk: application of engineered lactic acid bacteria that produce alpha-galactosidase.
AB  - Human consumption of soy-derived products has been limited by the presence of non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDO), such as the alpha-galactooligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose. Most mammals, including man, lack pancreatic alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal), which is necessary for the hydrolysis of these sugars. However, such NDO can be fermented by gas-producing microorganisms present in the cecum and large intestine, which in turn can induce flatulence and other gastrointestinal disorders in sensitive individuals. The use of microorganisms expressing alpha-Gal is a promising solution to the elimination of NDO before they reach the large intestine. In the present study, lactic acid bacteria engineered to degrade NDO have been constructed and are being used as a tool to evaluate this solution. The alpha-Gal structural genes from Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC8014 (previously characterized in our laboratory) and from guar have been cloned and expressed in Lactococcus lactis. The gene products were directed to different bacterial compartments to optimize their possible applications. The alpha-Gal-producing strains are being evaluated for their efficiency in degrading raffinose and stachyose: i) in soymilk fermentation when used as starters and ii) in situ in the upper gastrointestinal tract when administered to animals orally, as probiotic preparations. The expected outcomes and possible complications of this project are discussed.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - A rapid biosensor for viable B. anthracis spores.
AB  - A simple membrane-strip-based biosensor assay has been combined with a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) reaction for rapid (4 h) detection of a small number (ten) of viable B. anthracis spores. The biosensor is based on identification of a unique mRNA sequence from one of the anthrax toxin genes, the protective antigen ( pag), encoded on the toxin plasmid, pXO1, and thus provides high specificity toward B. anthracis. Previously, the anthrax toxins activator ( atxA) mRNA had been used in our laboratory for the development of a biosensor for the detection of a single B. anthracis spore within 12 h. Changing the target sequence to the pag mRNA provided the ability to shorten the overall assay time significantly. The vaccine strain of B. anthracis (Sterne strain) was used in all experiments. A 500-microL sample containing as few as ten spores was mixed with 500 microL growth medium and incubated for 30 min for spore germination and mRNA production. Thus, only spores that are viable were detected. Subsequently, RNA was extracted from lysed cells, selectively amplified using NASBA, and rapidly identified by the biosensor. While the biosensor assay requires only 15 min assay time, the overall process takes 4 h for detection of ten viable B. anthracis spores, and is shortened significantly if more spores are present. The biosensor is based on an oligonucleotide sandwich-hybridization assay format. It uses a membrane flow-through system with an immobilized DNA probe that hybridizes with the target sequence. Signal amplification is provided when the target sequence hybridizes to a second DNA probe that has been coupled to liposomes encapsulating the dye sulforhodamine B. The amount of liposomes captured in the detection zone can be read visually or quantified with a hand-held reflectometer. The biosensor can detect as little as 1 fmol target mRNA (1 nmol L(-1)). Specificity analysis revealed no cross-reactivity with 11 organisms tested, among them closely related species such as B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Chlostridium butyricum. Also, no false positive signals were obtained from nonviable spores. We suggest that this inexpensive biosensor is a viable option for rapid, on-site analysis providing highly specific data on the presence of viable B. anthracis spores.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - High-level gene expression in Lactobacillus plantarum using a pheromone-regulated bacteriocin promoter.
AB  - AIMS: To use promoters and regulatory genes involved in the production of the bacteriocin sakacin P to obtain high-level regulated gene expression in Lactobacillus plantarum. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a plasmid containing all three operons naturally involved in sakacin P production, the genes encoding sakacin P and its immunity protein were replaced by the aminopeptidase N gene from Lactococcus lactis (pepN) or the beta-glucuronidase gene from Escherichia coli (gusA). The new genes were precisely fused to the start codon of the sakacin P gene and the stop codon of the immunity gene. This set-up permitted regulated (external pheromone controlled) overexpression of both reporter genes in L. plantarum NC8. For PepN, production levels amounted to as much as 40% of total cellular protein. CONCLUSIONS: Promoters and regulatory genes involved in production of sakacin P are suitable for establishing inducible high-level gene expression in L. plantarum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study describes a system for controllable gene expression in lactobacilli, giving some of the highest expression levels reported so far in this genus.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of mannitol production in Lactococcus lactis: influence of  overexpression of mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase in different genetic backgrounds.
AB  - To obtain a mannitol-producing Lactococcus lactis strain, the mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (mtlD) from Lactobacillus plantarum was overexpressed in a wild-type strain, a lactate dehydrogenase(LDH)-deficient strain, and a strain with reduced phosphofructokinase activity. High-performance liquid chromatography and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that small amounts (<1%) of mannitol were formed by growing cells of mtlD-overexpressing LDH-deficient and phosphofructokinase-reduced strains, whereas resting cells of the LDH-deficient transformant converted 25% of glucose into mannitol. Moreover, the formed mannitol was not reutilized upon glucose depletion. Of the metabolic-engineering strategies investigated in this work, mtlD-overexpressing LDH-deficient L. lactis seemed to be the most promising strain for mannitol production.
TI  - Control of Listeria monocytogenes in a biofilm by competitive-exclusion microorganisms.
AB  - Biofilms from drains in food processing facilities with a recent history of no detectable Listeria monocytogenes in floor drains were cultured for microorganisms producing antilisterial metabolites. A total of 413 microbial isolates were obtained from 12 drain biofilm samples and were assayed at 15 and 37 degrees C for activities that were bactericidal or inhibitory to L. monocytogenes, by two agar plate assays. Twenty-one of 257 bacterial isolates and 3 of 156 yeast isolates had antilisterial activity. All 24 isolates which produced metabolites inhibitory to L. monocytogenes were assayed for antilisterial activity in coinoculated broth cultures containing tryptic soy broth with yeast extract (TSB-YE). A five-strain mixture of 10(3) CFU of L. monocytogenes/ml and 10(5) CFU of the candidate competitive-exclusion microorganism/ml was combined in TSB-YE and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h, 15 degrees C for 14 days, 8 degrees C for 21 days, and 4 degrees C for 28 days. Substantial inhibition of L. monocytogenes growth (4 to 5 log CFU/ml) was observed for nine bacterial isolates at 37 degrees C, two at 15 and 8 degrees C, and three at 4 degrees C. The inhibitory isolates were identified as Enterococcus durans (six isolates), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (two isolates), and Lactobacillus plantarum (one isolate). The anti-L. monocytogenes activity of these isolates was evaluated in biofilms of L. monocytogenes on stainless steel coupons at 37, 15, 8, and 4 degrees C. Results revealed that two isolates (E. durans strain 152 and L. lactis subsp. lactis strain C-1-92) were highly inhibitory to L. monocytogenes (growth inhibition of >5 log(10) CFU of L. monocytogenes/cm(2)). These two bacterial isolates appear to be excellent competitive-exclusion candidates to control L. monocytogenes in biofilms at environmental temperatures of 4 to 37 degrees C.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  - Nostrano di Primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park area in the Italian Dolomites. In summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, Passo Rolle and Vanoi, in the Paneveggio Natural Park. During the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. The microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by RAPD analysis and identified by 16S rRNA sequence. The milk of the Passo Rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic Streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the Vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei. The plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. The dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. Moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. The Vanoi cheese was dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus macedonicus in the first two days and mesophilic 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. In the first few days, the Rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic S. macedonicus and S. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. During ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. The taxonomical identification by 16S rRNA sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of S. macedonicus, Lactobacillus plantarum, 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum and E. faecium were detected in both cheeses.
TI  - Enhanced mucosal delivery of antigen with cell wall mutants of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The potential of recombinant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to deliver heterologous antigens to the immune system and to induce protective immunity has been best demonstrated by using the C subunit of tetanus toxin (TTFC) as a model antigen. Two types of LAB carriers have mainly been used, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis, which differ substantially in their abilities to resist passage through the stomach and to persist in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Here we analyzed the effect of a deficiency in alanine racemase, an enzyme that participates in cell wall synthesis, in each of these bacterial carriers. Recombinant wild-type and mutant strains of L. plantarum NCIMB8826 and L. lactis MG1363 producing TTFC intracellularly were constructed and used in mouse immunization experiments. Remarkably, we observed that the two cell wall mutant strains were far more immunogenic than their wild-type counterparts when the intragastric route was used. However, intestinal TTFC-specific immunoglobulin A was induced only after immunization with the recombinant L. plantarum mutant strain. Moreover, the alanine racemase mutant of either LAB strain allowed induction of a much stronger serum TTFC-specific immune response after immunization via the vagina, which is a quite different ecosystem than the gastrointestinal tract. The design and use of these mutants thus resulted in a major improvement in the mucosal delivery of antigens exhibiting vaccine properties.
TI  - Intra-specific variation of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus in sensitivity towards various bacteriocins.
AB  - Fifty-two strains belonging to the Lactobacillus plantarum species group were identified and typed. They represented 32 clones of Lactobacillus plantarum and 7 clones of Lactobacillus pentosus. Sensitivity of all strains towards bacteriocins of four different producer strains was investigated using a deferred inhibition test (DIT). Substantial intra-specific variation in sensitivity of clones was observed towards bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria producing nisin ( Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454) or pediocin PA-1 ( Pediococcus acidilactici PAC-1.0), while none of the strains were sensitive towards the two remaining bacteriocin producers. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nisin towards selected strains confirmed the DIT results. No correlation between the susceptibility of fourteen selected strains towards nisin and an array of antibiotics was found. The present study indicates that the variation in bacteriocin-sensitivity within target species might be a potential limitation for the application of bacteriocins as biopreservatives.
TI  - Use of bacteriocin promoters for gene expression in Lactobacillus plantarum C11.
AB  - AIMS: To exploit promoters involved in production of the bacteriocin sakacin P for regulated overexpression of genes in Lactobacillus plantarum C11. METHODS AND RESULTS: Production of sakacin P by Lact. sakei LTH673 is controlled by a peptide-based quorum sensing system that drives strong, regulated promoters. One of these promoters (PorfX) was used to establish regulated overexpression of genes encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from Bacillus pumilus, aminopeptidase N from Lactococcus lactis or chitinase B from Serratia marcescens in Lact. plantarum C11, a strain that naturally possesses the regulatory machinery that is necessary for promoter activation. The expression levels obtained were highly dependent on which gene was used and on how the promoter was coupled to this gene. The highest expression levels (14% of total cellular protein) were obtained with the aminopeptidase N gene translationally fused to the regulated promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Sakacin promoters permit regulated expression of a variety of genes in Lact. plantarum C11. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows the usefulness of regulated bacteriocin promoters for developing new gene expression systems for lactic acid bacteria, in particular lactobacilli.
TI  - Induction of plantaricin production in Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 after coculture with specific gram-positive bacteria is mediated by an autoinduction mechanism.
AB  - Plantaricin NC8 (PLNC8), a coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from Lactobacillus plantarum NC8, has recently been purified and genetically characterized. Analysis of an 8.1-kb NC8 DNA region downstream of the PLNC8 operon revealed the presence of at least four operons involved in bacteriocin production, showing high homology to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum C11. However, we found a three-component regulatory operon involving a quorum-sensing mechanism. Two of these components, the induction factor (PLNC8IF) and the histidine kinase, are novel, while the response regulator is identical to PlnD from C11. Homologous expression of plNC8IF in NC8 allowed constitutive bacteriocin production. Heterologous expression of this gene in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 produced supernatants which promoted bacteriocin production in NC8. Reverse transcription-PCR studies indicated that cocultivation of NC8 with inducing cells promoted transcription of the bacteriocin and regulatory operons in NC8. An identical result was obtained after addition of an external source of PLNC8IF. We propose that the presence of specific bacteria could act as an environmental signal that is able to switch on bacteriocin production in L. plantarum NC8 via a quorum-sensing mechanism mediated by PLNC8IF.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CHCC 2115.
AB  - AIM: Purification and characterization of an aminotransferase (AT) specific for the degradation of branched-chain amino acids from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CHCC 2115. METHODS AND RESULTS: The purification protocol consisted of anion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The enzyme was found to exist as a monomer with a molecular mass of 40-50 kDa. The AT converted isoleucine, leucine and valine at a similar rate with alpha-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor; minor activity was shown for methionine. The enzyme had pH and temperature optima of 7.3 and 43 degrees C, respectively, and activity was detected at the pH and salt conditions found in cheese (pH 5.2, 4% NaCl). Hg2+ completely inhibited the enzyme, and the inhibition pattern was similar to that for pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes, when studying the effect of other metal ions, thiol- and carbonyl-binding agents. The N-terminal sequence of the enzyme was SVNIDWNNLGFDYMQLPYRYVAHXKDGVXD, and had at the amino acid level, 60 and 53% identity to a branched-chain amino acid AT of Lact. plantarum and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei CHCC 2115 may contribute to development of flavour in cheese. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this work contribute to the knowledge of transamination performed by cheese-related bacteria, and in the understanding and control of amino acid catabolism and the production of aroma compounds.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) from sourdough  lactic acid bacteria and evaluation of their in vitro and in situ activity.
AB  - AIMS: To identify and characterize bacteriocion-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in sourdoughs and to compare in vitro and in situ bacteriocin activity of sourdough- and nonsourdough LAB. METHODS AND RESULTS: Production of antimicrobial compounds by 437 Lactobacillus strains isolated from 70 sourdoughs was investigated. Five strains (Lactobacillus pentosus 2MF8 and 8CF, Lb. plantarum 4DE and 3DM and Lactobacillus spp. CS1) were found to produce distinct bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). BLIS-producing Lactococcus lactis isolated from raw barley showed a wider inhibitory spectrum than sourdough LAB, but they did not inhibit all strains of the key sourdough bacterium Lb. sanfranciscensis. Antimicrobial production by Lb. pentosus 2MF8 and Lc. lactis M30 was also demonstrated in situ. CONCLUSIONS: BLIS production by sourdough LAB appears to occur at a low frequency, showing limited inhibitory spectrum when compared with BLIS-producing Lc. lactis. Nevertheless, they are active BLIS producers under sourdough and bread-making conditions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The activity of BLIS has been demonstrated in situ. It may influence the complex sourdough microflora and support the implantation and stability of selected insensitive bacteria, such as Lb. sanfranciscensis, useful to confer good characteristics to the dough.
TI  - Selection and characterization of conditionally active promoters in Lactobacillus plantarum, using alanine racemase as a promoter probe.
AB  - This paper describes the use of the alr gene, encoding alanine racemase, as a promoter-screening tool for the identification of conditional promoters in Lactobacillus plantarum. Random fragments of the L. plantarum WCFS1 genome were cloned upstream of the promoterless alr gene of Lactococcus lactis in a low-copy-number plasmid vector. The resulting plasmid library was introduced into an L. plantarum Deltaalr strain (MD007), and 40,000 clones were selected. The genome coverage of the library was estimated to be 98%, based on nucleotide insert sequence and restriction analyses of the inserts of randomly selected clones. The library was screened for clones that were capable of complementing the D-alanine auxotroph phenotype of MD007 in media containing up to 10, 100, or 300 micro g of the competitive Alr inhibitor D-cycloserine per ml. Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies raised against lactococcal Alr revealed that the Alr production level required for growth increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of D-cycloserine, adding a quantitative factor to the primarily qualitative nature of the alr complementation screen. Screening of the alr complementation library for clones that could grow only in the presence of 0.8 M NaCl resulted in the identification of eight clones that upon Western blot analysis showed significantly higher Alr production under high-salt conditions than under low-salt conditions. These results established the effectiveness of the alanine racemase complementation screening method for the identification of promoters on their conditional or constitutive activity.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria as prime candidates for codon optimization.
AB  - In species having a strong correlation of expressivity and codon bias it has been shown that heterologous expression can be optimized by changing codons of the introduced gene towards the set of codons that the host organism naturally uses in its highly expressed genes. Even though two lactic acid bacteria are fully sequenced, there are no reports on attempts of codon optimization in the literature. In this report it is demonstrated that codons used in highly expressed genes tend to differ from the codons in lowly expressed genes, and that there is a strong correlation of codon bias and empirical expressivity (codon adaptation index) in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. This strongly suggests that codon optimization strategies could be applied to expression systems with lactic acid bacteria as producer strains. A good example of a candidate for codon optimization is the mouse interleukin-2 gene, which in its natural form has an extremely low codon adaptation index for expression in Lc. lactis.
TI  - Multiple competitive PCR-DGGE as a tool for quantifying and profiling defined mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria during production of probiotics from complex polysaccharides.
AB  - AIMS: To apply a denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (DGGE) method to quantify and profile individual strains during a mixed culture fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was extracted during the culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and amplified in a multiple competitive PCR (cPCR) using general primers targeting 16S rDNA and DNA from Streptococcus salivarius as competitive DNA. Subsequently the 200-kb amplified fragments were separated by DGGE. The method was validated in pure cultures and used to profile a mixture of three LAB grown on glucose, soluble starch and glycogen from mussel processing waste. The inclusion of a starch- and glycogen-degrading strain (Lactobacillus plantarum) and a weakly amylotic nisin-resistant strain (Lact. paracasei) allowed proliferation of the nisin producing Lactococcus lactis which in itself is unable to grow on complex carbohydrates. cPCR-DGGE permitted the monitoring of a different strain succession on the different carbohydrates, related to amylolytic activity and substrate consumption, acid production and nisin production. CONCLUSIONS: cPCR-DGGE is a useful tool for profiling defined mixed cultures of bacteria and hence allows their interaction to be studied. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Provided validation of the method for each specific case, it may be appropriate to monitor and control the reproducibility of any defined mixed culture of bacteria, with the advantage that an increase in the strain numbers to be monitored does not yield an increase in the labour of the procedure.
TI  - Mucosal co-application of lactic acid bacteria and allergen induces counter-regulatory immune responses in a murine model of birch pollen allergy.
AB  - Recent epidemiological studies and clinical trials suggest a possible role of certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains in the prevention of allergic diseases. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the immunomodulatory potential of two LAB strains, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum, for prophylaxis and therapy of allergic immune responses. Both LAB strains-induced high levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma in naive murine spleen cell cultures. Intranasal co-application with recombinant Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, prior or after allergic sensitization, led to increased levels of allergen-specific IgG2a antibodies and in vitro IFN-gamma production, indicating a shift towards Th1 responses. Successful immunomodulation by the mucosal pre-treatment was further demonstrated by suppression of allergen-induced basophil degranulation. We conclude that these LAB strains in combination with an allergen could be promising candidates for mucosal vaccination against type I allergy.
TI  - The potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  - The metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. There were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. Some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. Alanine and aspartate were utilised by some LAB and accumulated during the incubation of other LAB. Arginine was degraded not only by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lactobacillus brevis and Lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. Serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lb. rhamnosus and Lb. plantarum. Of the LAB studied, Lb. brevis and Lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. Leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. The formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. These findings suggest that the potential of LAB for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of LAB and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.
TI  - Microbial quality and direct PCR identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic Staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  - Detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific PCR. Without enrichment, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. Enriched samples allowed the detection of L. sakei and S. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of Enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. The percentages of L. curvatus, L. plantarum, Staphylococcus carnosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. L. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. L. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. S. epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and S. carnosus was detected in only 5.9% of chorizos. Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. From a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of Enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of the food-borne pathogens assayed.
TI  - Effects of cultivation conditions on folate production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A variety of lactic acid bacteria were screened for their ability to produce folate intracellularly and/or extracellularly. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc spp. all produced folate, while most Lactobacillus spp., with the exception of Lactobacillus plantarum, were not able to produce folate. Folate production was further investigated in L. lactis as a model organism for metabolic engineering and in S. thermophilus for direct translation to (dairy) applications. For both these two lactic acid bacteria, an inverse relationship was observed between growth rate and folate production. When cultures were grown at inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics or salt or when the bacteria were subjected to low growth rates in chemostat cultures, folate levels in the cultures were increased relative to cell mass and (lactic) acid production. S. thermophilus excreted more folate than L. lactis, presumably as a result of differences in the number of glutamyl residues of the folate produced. In S. thermophilus 5,10-methenyl and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate were detected as the major folate derivatives, both containing three glutamyl residues, while in L. lactis 5,10-methenyl and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate were found, both with either four, five, or six glutamyl residues. Excretion of folate was stimulated at lower pH in S. thermophilus, but pH had no effect on folate excretion by L. lactis. Finally, several environmental parameters that influence folate production in these lactic acid bacteria were observed; high external pH increased folate production and the addition of p-aminobenzoic acid stimulated folate production, while high tyrosine concentrations led to decreased folate biosynthesis.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin Salers cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  - Microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin Salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in France, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. The aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of RDO Salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. This included DNA extraction, PCR, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Bacterial and high-GC% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify V2 or V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. SSCP patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. Patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. Bacteria belonging to the high-GC% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. The present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Complete DNA sequence and analysis of two cryptic plasmids isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of two cryptic plasmids isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum strain AS1.2986 has been determined. The smaller plasmid, designated pLP2000, encodes a 37.0kDa Rep protein and has a 17bp sequence repeated 10 times. Sequence analysis of the larger plasmid, designated pLP9000, revealed nine putative open reading frames (ORFs). Based on sequence similarity, ORF1 codes for a putative magnesium transporter protein that shows similarities to CorA from plasmid pCIS3 (Lactococcus lactis). None of the nine ORFs shows similarity to any known Rep protein. Southern blot analysis indicates these two plasmids both replicate via a rolling circle (RC) mechanism.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial community structure and location in Stilton cheese.
AB  - The microbial diversity occurring in Stilton cheese was evaluated by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. DNA templates for PCR experiments were directly extracted from the cheese as well as bulk cells harvested from a variety of viable-count media. The variable V3 and V4-V5 regions of the 16S genes were analyzed. Closest relatives of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus equorum, and Staphylococcus sp. were identified by sequencing of the DGGE fragments. Fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes were developed to detect Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments, and their specificity for the species occurring in the community of Stilton cheese was checked in FISH experiments carried out with reference cultures. The combined use of these probes and the bacterial probe Eub338 in FISH experiments on Stilton cheese sections allowed the assessment of the spatial distribution of the different microbial species in the dairy matrix. Microbial colonies of bacteria showed a differential location in the different parts of the cheese examined: the core, the veins, and the crust. Lactococci were found in the internal part of the veins as mixed colonies and as single colonies within the core. Lactobacillus plantarum was detected only underneath the surface, while Leuconostoc microcolonies were homogeneously distributed in all parts observed. The combined molecular approach is shown to be useful to simultaneously describe the structure and location of the bacterial flora in cheese. The differential distribution of species found suggests specific ecological reasons for the establishment of sites of actual microbial growth in the cheese, with implications of significance in understanding the ecology of food systems and with the aim of achieving optimization of the fermentation technologies as well as preservation of traditional products.
TI  - Sequence and analysis of pBM02, a novel RCR cryptic plasmid from Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris P8-2-47.
AB  - This paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3.85 kbp plasmid pBM02 from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris P8-2-47. Analysis of the sequence predicted six ORFs larger than 25 amino acids. They all were transcribed from the same strand and organized in two functional cassettes: the replication region and a putative mobilization region. In the replication region, two ORFs specifying proteins homologous to others found in some classes of rolling circle-replicating plasmids were encountered (copG and repB). In fact, single-stranded DNA was detected as a replication intermediate of pBM02. copG and repB, together with some upstream sequences, formed part of the minimal replication unit of the plasmid. Interestingly, pBM02 shared a 212 bp stretch with plasmids of the pWV01 type, in which the whole single-strand origin of replication is included. In the mobilization region, an ORF coding for a mobilization-like protein was present, preceded by a putative oriT sequence homologous to that of plasmid pMV158. The replicon of pBM02 is of the wide-host range type, and functions in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with paddy rice silage  as determined by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis.
AB  - A total of 161 low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. Based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (LAB) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and WEISSELLA: Analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was used to confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. The virtually complete 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified and sequenced. The sequences from the various LAB isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the GenBank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). Phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rDNA sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. With the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. The prevalent LAB, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of Lactobacillus plantarum (24%), Lactococcus lactis (22%), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), Pediococcus acidilactici (11%), Lactobacillus brevis (11%), Enterococcus faecalis (7%), Weissella kimchii (3%), and Pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). The present study, the first to fully document rice-associated LAB, showed a very diverse community of LAB with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. The comprehensive 16S rDNA-based approach to describing LAB community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.
TI  - Purification and genetic characterization of plantaricin NC8, a novel coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from Lactobacillus plantarum NC8.
AB  - A new, coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin named plantaricin NC8 (PLNC8)  was isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 cultures which had been induced with Lactococcus lactis MG1363 or Pediococcus pentosaceus FBB63. This bacteriocin consists of two distinct peptides, named alpha and beta, which were separated by C(2)-C(18) reverse-phase chromatography and whose complementary action is necessary for full plantaricin NC8 activity. N-terminal sequencing of both purified peptides showed 28 and 34 amino acids residues for PLNC8 alpha and PLNC8 beta, respectively, which showed no sequence similarity to other known bacteriocins. Mass spectrometry analysis showed molecular masses of 3,587 Da (alpha) and 4,000 Da (beta). The corresponding genes, designated plNC8A and plNC8B, were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences revealed that both peptides are produced as bacteriocin precursors of 47 and 55 amino acids, respectively, which include N-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. The mature alpha and beta peptides contain 29 and 34 amino acids, respectively. An open reading frame, orfC, which encodes a putative immunity protein was found downstream of plNC8B and overlapping plNC8A. Upstream of the putative -35 region of plNC8B, two direct repeats of 9 bp were identified, which agrees with the consensus sequence and structure of promoters of class II bacteriocin operons whose expression is dependent on an autoinduction mechanism.
TI  - Fermented vegetable juices obtained from celery, parsley and tomato.
AB  - Application of starter cultures in fermented food industry results in obtaining high quality products, standardized sensory properties and allows to shorten a time of production. Employment of appropriate starter cultures indices the possibility of develop a new assortment of fermented products which can not be obtain in traditional way. The aim of study was to produce fermented vegetable juices using starter cultures with different quantitative and qualitative composition. Parsley, celery and tomato juices have been fermented using 0.25-5.0% addition of starter culture. The most acceptable sensory properties exhibited juices produced with 0.25-3.0% addition of starter culture composed of Lactobacillus brevis 6, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis 5K and Lactobacillus plantarum 5, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis 4K. The value of pH of fermented juices varied from 3.8 to 3.6. Concentration of lactic acid was at a level from 0.8 to 1.2%. Stability of fermented juices at a temperature of 6 degrees C was 4 weeks.
TI  - Esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  - In the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. Esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. The lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. By studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. Lactobacillus plantarum O236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. Lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. The intracellular and extracellular fractions of Leuconostoc mesenteroides O257, Lactobacillus plantarum O236, and Lactobacillus acidophilus O177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. L. plantarum O186, L. acidophilus O252, Enterococcus faecium O174 and O426, and Enterococcus faecalis Ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. Lactococcus lactis O233, L. plantarum O155, and Lactobacillus casei O190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. Not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. Esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. Wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.
TI  - Isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a Ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  - One hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from Uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. Isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using API 50 CHL kits and additional biochemical tests. Coliforms, yeasts and LAB were enumerated in bushera. The pH, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. The LAB counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). The coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). The pH of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. Ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. The initial numbers of LAB and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the LAB numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. LAB counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. Coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). Yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. The pH declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. Lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus genera. Tentatively, Lactobacillus isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. LAB isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus. Eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), Weissella confusa (one strain) and L. plantarum (one strain).
TI  - Use of the alr gene as a food-grade selection marker in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Both Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum contain a single alr gene, encoding an alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1), which catalyzes the interconversion of D-alanine and L-alanine. The alr genes of these lactic acid bacteria were investigated for their application as food-grade selection markers in a heterologous complementation approach. Since isogenic mutants of both species carrying an alr deletion (Deltaalr) showed auxotrophy for D-alanine, plasmids carrying a heterologous alr were constructed and could be selected, since they complemented D-alanine auxotrophy in the L. plantarum Deltaalr and L. lactis Deltaalr strains. Selection was found to be highly stringent, and plasmids were stably maintained over 200 generations of culturing. Moreover, the plasmids carrying the heterologous alr genes could be stably maintained in wild-type strains of L. plantarum and L. lactis by selection for resistance to D-cycloserine, a competitive inhibitor of Alr (600 and 200 micro g/ml, respectively). In addition, a plasmid carrying the L. plantarum alr gene under control of the regulated nisA promoter was constructed to demonstrate that D-cycloserine resistance of L. lactis is linearly correlated to the alr expression level. Finally, the L. lactis alr gene controlled by the nisA promoter, together with the nisin-regulatory genes nisRK, were integrated into the chromosome of L. plantarum Deltaalr. The resulting strain could grow in the absence of D-alanine only when expression of the alr gene was induced with nisin.
TI  - The evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  - The effectiveness of yeast extracts (YE) and potato extracts (PE) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (AS). Two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using ODmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) Eleven lots from the same PE-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. The ODmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. The growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% PE than in base medium containing 100% YE for both ODmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in PE. In AS assays, highest OD values for Lactobacillus casei EQ28, Lactobacillus rhamnosus R-011, Lactobacillus plantarum EQ12, and Streptococcus thermophilus R-083 were obtained with a mixture of PE and YE. Fermentations (2 L) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of AS to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. In these fermentations, replacement of 50% YE with PE was shown to enable good growth of S. thermophilus. With L. rhamnosus R-011, a high correlation (R2 = 0.95) was found between ODmax data obtained in the AS assays and that of the 2-L bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. However, AS was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. The relationship was still good for ODmax between AS data and that of the bioreactor data with L. rhamnosus R-011 in industrial LBS medium (R2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the S. thermophilus R-083 on Rosell #43 industrial medium (R2 = 0.33). Since PE cost 40% less than YE, there are strong economic advantages in considering such a partial replacement of YE by PE.
TI  - Protection against tetanus toxin after intragastric administration of two recombinant lactic acid bacteria: impact of strain viability and in vivo persistence.
AB  - Non-pathogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are attractive as live carriers to deliver protective antigens to the mucosal immune system. Both persisting and non-persisting strains of lactic acid bacteria have been evaluated and seem to work equally well by the systemic and nasal routes of administration. However, it is not known if persistence and viability of the strain play a critical role when immunizing by the oral route. To address this question, recombinant LAB strains, able to persist (Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826/pMEC127) or not (Lactococcus lactis MG1363/pMEC46) in the gastro-intestinal tract of mice and producing equivalent amounts of the tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) were compared to each other. A very strong ELISA TTFC-specific and protective humoral response was elicited by either live or UV-inactivated recombinant Lb. plantarum strains. In a similar protocol, recombinant Lc. lactis seemed to be somewhat less efficient than the former host. It is thus tempting to propose that the difference in the capacity of the bacterial vector to persist in the gastro-intestinal tract impacts on its immunogenicity and on the level of protection it may induce. Protection was slightly superior after administration of live strains.
TI  - In situ determination of the intracellular pH of Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum during pressure treatment.
AB  - Hydrostatic pressure may affect the intracellular pH of microorganisms by (i) enhancing the dissociation of weak organic acids and (ii) increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane and inactivation of enzymes required for pH homeostasis. The internal pHs of Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum during and after pressure treatment at 200 and 300 MPa and at pH values ranging from 4.0 to 6.5 were determined. Pressure treatment at 200 MPa for up to 20 min did not reduce the viability of either strain at pH 6.5. Pressure treatment at pH 6.5 and 300 MPa reduced viable cell counts of Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum by 5 log after 20 and 120 min, respectively. Pressure inactivation was faster at pH 5 or 4. At ambient pressure, both strains maintained a transmembrane pH gradient of 1 pH unit at neutral pH and about 2 pH units at pH 4.0. During pressure treatment at 200 and 300 MPa, the internal pH of L. lactis was decreased to the value of the extracellular pH during compression. The same result was observed during treatment of Lactobacillus plantarum at 300 MPa. Lactobacillus plantarum was unable to restore the internal pH after a compression-decompression cycle at 300 MPa and pH 6.5. Lactococcus lactis lost the ability to restore its internal pH after 20 and 4 min of pressure treatment at 200 and 300 MPa, respectively. As a consequence, pressure-mediated stress reactions and cell death may be considered secondary effects promoted by pH and other environmental conditions.
TI  - A food-grade cloning vector for lactic acid bacteria based on the nisin immunity  gene nisI.
AB  - A new food-grade cloning vector for lactic acid bacteria was constructed using the nisin immunity gene nisI as a selection marker. The food-grade plasmid, pLEB 590, was constructed entirely of lactococcal DNA: the pSH 71 replicon, the nisI gene, and the constitutive promoter P45 for nisI expression. Electroporation into Lactococcus lactis MG 1614 with 60 international units (IU) nisin/ml selection yielded approximately 10(5) transformants/ micro g DNA. MG 1614 carrying pLEB 590 was shown to be able to grow in medium containing a maximum of 250 IU nisin/ml. Plasmid pLEB 590 was successfully transformed into an industrial L. lactis cheese starter carrying multiple cryptic plasmids. Suitability for molecular cloning was confirmed by cloning and expressing the proline iminopeptidase gene pepI from Lactobacillus helveticus in L. lactis and Lb. plantarum. These results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper has potential for expression of foreign genes in lactic acid bacteria in order to construct improved starter bacteria for food applications.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin KS, an antilisterial peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii NFRI 7393.
AB  - Mundticin KS, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus mundtii NFRI 7393 isolated from grass silage in Thailand, is active against closely related lactic acid bacteria and the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In this study, biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin KS was done. Mundticin KS was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sequential ion-exchange chromatography, and solid-phase extraction. The gene cluster (mun locus) for mundticin KS production was cloned, and DNA sequencing revealed that the mun locus consists of three genes, designated munA, munB, and munC. The munA gene encodes a 58-amino-acid mundticin KS precursor, munB encodes a protein of 674 amino acids involved in translocation and processing of the bacteriocin, and munC encodes a mundticin KS immunity protein of 98 amino acids. Amino acid and nucleotide sequencing revealed the complete, unambiguous primary structure of mundticin KS; mundticin KS comprises a 43-amino-acid peptide with an amino acid sequence similar to that of mundticin ATO6 produced by E. mundtii ATO6. Mundticin KS and mundticin ATO6 are distinguished by the inversion of the last two amino acids at their respective C termini. These two mundticins were expressed in Escherichia coli as recombinant peptides and found to be different in activity against certain Lactobacillus strains, such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus. Mundticin KS was successfully expressed by transformation with the recombinant plasmid containing the mun locus in heterogeneous hosts such as E. faecium, L. curvatus, and Lactococcus lactis. Based on our results, the mun locus is located on a 50-kb plasmid, pML1, of E. mundtii NFRI 7393.
TI  - Characterization of the genetic locus responsible for the production of ABP-118,  a novel bacteriocin produced by the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118.
AB  - ABP-118, a small heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118, a strain isolated from the ileal-caecal region of the human gastrointestinal tract, was purified to homogeneity. Using reverse genetics, a DNA fragment specifying part of ABP-118 was identified on a 10769 bp chromosomal region. Analysis of this region revealed that ABP-118 was a Class IIb two-peptide bacteriocin composed of Abp118alpha, which exhibited the antimicrobial activity, and Abp118beta, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity. The gene conferring strain UCC118 immunity to the action of ABP-118, abpIM, was identified downstream of the abp118beta gene. Located further downstream of abp118beta, several ORFs were identified whose deduced proteins resembled those of proteins involved in bacteriocin regulation and secretion. Heterologous expression of ABP-118 was achieved in Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus cereus. In addition, the abp118 locus encoded an inducing peptide, AbpIP, which was shown to play a role in the regulation of ABP-118 production. This novel bacteriocin is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to be isolated from a known human probiotic bacterium and to be characterized at the genetic level.
TI  - Chemical and microbiological characterisation of kefir grains.
AB  - Chemical and microbiological composition of four Argentinean kefir grains from different sources as well as characteristics of the corresponding fermented milk were studied. Kefir grains CIDCA AGK1, AGK2 and AGK4 did not show significant differences in their chemical and microbiological composition. In contrast, protein and yeast content of AGK3 was higher than in the other grains. Although grain microflora comprised lactobacilli, lactococcus, acetic acid bacteria and yeast, we found an important difference regarding species. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus plantarum, Acetobacter and Saccharomyces were present in all types of kefir grain. While Leuconostoc mesenteroides was only isolated from grains CIDCA AGK1 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis, Lactobacillus parakefir and Kluyveromyces marxianus were only isolated from CIDCA AGK2 grains. All grains produced acid products with pH between 3.5 and 4.0. The apparent viscosity of AGK1 fermented milk was greater than the product obtained with AGK4. All fermented milks had inhibitory power towards Escherichia coli but AGK1 and AGK2 supernatants were able to halt the bacterial growth for at least 25 h. Grain weight increment in AGK1, AGK2 and AGK3 during growth in milk did not show significant differences. Despite their fermenting activity, AGK4 grains did not increase their weight.
TI  - Osmosensing and osmoregulatory compatible solute accumulation by bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria inhabit natural and artificial environments with diverse and fluctuating osmolalities, salinities and temperatures. Many maintain cytoplasmic hydration, growth and survival most effectively by accumulating kosmotropic organic solutes (compatible solutes) when medium osmolality is high or temperature is low (above freezing). They release these solutes into their environment when the medium osmolality drops. Solutes accumulate either by synthesis or by transport from the extracellular medium. Responses to growth in high osmolality medium, including biosynthetic accumulation of trehalose, also protect Salmonella typhimurium from heat shock. Osmotically regulated transporters and mechanosensitive channels modulate cytoplasmic solute levels in Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. Each organism harbours multiple osmoregulatory transporters with overlapping substrate specificities. Membrane proteins that can act as both osmosensors and osmoregulatory transporters have been identified (secondary transporters ProP of E. coli and BetP of C. glutamicum as well as ABC transporter OpuA of L. lactis). The molecular bases for the modulation of gene expression and transport activity by temperature and medium osmolality are under intensive investigation with emphasis on the role of the membrane as an antenna for osmo- and/or thermosensors.
TI  - Dynamics of the microbial community responsible for traditional sour cassava starch fermentation studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative rRNA hybridization.
AB  - The microbial community developing during the spontaneous fermentation of sour cassava starch was investigated by cultivation-independent methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partially amplified 16S rDNA followed by sequencing of the most intense bands showed that the dominant organisms were all lactic acid bacteria (LAB), mainly close relatives of Bifidobacterium minimum, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus saccharolyticus and Lactobacillus plantarum., Close relatives of Lb. panis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Ln. citreum were also found. A complementary analysis using hybridization of 16S rRNA with phylogenetic probes was necessary to detect the presence of the recently discovered species Lb. manihotivorans. Although it represented up to 13% of the total lactic acid bacteria of sour cassava starch, this species could not be detected by DGGE as the PCR product migrated to the same position as Lc. lactis. In addition, it was shown that a strong pH decrease in the time course of fermentation was most probably responsible for the competitive selection of acid-resistant LAB vs. both homo and heterofermentative acid-sensitive LAB.
TI  - Characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest Argentina.
AB  - Indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest Argentina. Mean growth counts on M17, MRS, and MSE agar media did not show significant differences (P < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. Isolates of lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as Enterococcus (48%), lactococci (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). All lactococci were identified as Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). Lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). Enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. L. plantarum (93%), L. acidophilus (5%), and Lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers. L. plantarum and L. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. The majority of the lactobacilli and Lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. Enzyme activities (API-ZYM tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of L. plantarum strains were considerably higher. The predominance of L. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species Triticum durum and Triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of Southern Italy.
AB  - The microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the Apulia region, Southern Italy, was characterized. The sourdoughs were mainly produced from Triticum durum wheat. The number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. About 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. Phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16S rDNA and 16S/23S rRNA spacer region PCR. Overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as Lb. alimentarius, 14% as Lb. brevis, 12% as Leuconostoc citreum, 7% as Lb. plantarum, 6% as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as Lb. fermentum and Lb. acidophilus, 2% as Weissella confusa and 1% as Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. Since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. The phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. A microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total DNA extraction and purification procedure and PCR amplification of 16S rDNA for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. Thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. These partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database of NCBI. The identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. This analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus suis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. casei, Lact. alimentarium, and Lact. delbruekii and Clostridium sp. Two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. Unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. Use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
TI  - The microbiology of South African traditional fermented milks.
AB  - A total of 15 samples of traditional fermented milk were collected from individual households in South Africa and Namibia. Lactic acid bacteria dominated the microflora of these samples, especially the genera Leuconostoc, Lactococcus and Lactobacillus. Other groups identified included pyogenic streptococci and enterococci. The dominant lactococci species was Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Eighty-three percent of the leuconostoc isolates were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum. Other species identified included Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum.
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Molecular analysis of mutated Lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence P15.
AB  - The promoter-like sequence P15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 is active in Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Escherichia coli, but not in Lactococcus lactis. N-methyl-N-nitroso-N-guanidine (MNNG) mutagenesis of P15 was used to select for a promoter active in L. lactis MG1363. Molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated P16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a T-->A transversion. This deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. The activity of P16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pBV5030 (designated pLA16). The MIC of chloramphenicol in L. lactis, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, E. coli, and L. acidophilus harbouring pLA16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/mL, respectively. This represents an increase in promoter activity compared to P15 in L. reuteri of 3-fold, in L. plantarum of 9-fold, and in E. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in L. acidophilus of 7-fold.
TI  - Adaptation of the nisin-controlled expression system in Lactobacillus plantarum:  a tool to study in vivo biological effects.
AB  - The potential of lactic acid bacteria as live vehicles for the production and delivery of therapeutic molecules is being actively investigated today. For future applications it is essential to be able to establish dose-response curves for the targeted biological effect and thus to control the production of a heterologous biopeptide by a live lactobacillus. We therefore implemented in Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 the powerful nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system based on the autoregulatory properties of the bacteriocin nisin, which is produced by Lactococcus lactis. The original two-plasmid NICE system turned out to be poorly suited to L. plantarum. In order to obtain a stable and reproducible nisin dose-dependent synthesis of a reporter protein (beta-glucuronidase) or a model antigen (the C subunit of the tetanus toxin, TTFC), the lactococcal nisRK regulatory genes were integrated into the chromosome of L. plantarum NCIMB8826. Moreover, recombinant L. plantarum producing increasing amounts of TTFC was used to establish a dose-response curve after subcutaneous administration to mice. The induced serum immunoglobulin G response was correlated with the dose of antigen delivered by the live lactobacilli.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from Lactobacillus phages.
AB  - Three prophage sequences were identified in the Lactobacillus johnsoni strain NCC533. Prophage Lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site Streptococcus thermophilus phages over its DNA packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. Sequence similarity linked the putative DNA packaging and head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. Prophage Lj965/S. thermophilus phage Sfi11/Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1 on one hand and Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H/Lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/Listeria monocytogenes phage A118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 linked both sublines. The putative major head and tail proteins from Lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from Gram-negative bacteria. A clearly independent line of structural genes in Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site phages including Lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage D3 infecting a Gram-negative bacterium. A phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the ClpP-like protein identified in four cos-site Siphoviridae from Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. The tree suggested that the ClpP-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk during fermentation with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk during fermentation with starter and nonstarter lactic acid bacteria was investigated. Pasteurized milk was co-inoculated with approximately 10(4) CFU/ml of L. monocytogenes and 10(6) CFU/ml of Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Inoculated milks were incubated at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 to 72 h. Listeria monocytogenes survived and also grew to some extent during incubation in the presence of all starter cultures; however, inhibition ranged from 83 to 100% based on maximum cell populations. During incubation with L. bulgaricus and L. plantarum, L. monocytogenes was completely inactivated after 20 h and 64 h of incubation at 37 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. The pH of the fermenting milks declined steadily throughout the fermentation periods and was approximately 4.2 at the conclusion of the experimental period regardless both of the starter culture and pathogen combination or the temperature of incubation.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826, Lactobacillus fermentum KLD, and Lactococcus lactis MG 1363 in the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Genetically modified lactic acid bacteria may be a way to deliver vaccinal epitopes in the gastrointestinal tract. AIM: Three strains of lactic acid bacteria were studied for their pharmacokinetics in the human gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: The survival of the strains was studied up to the ileum in six subjects each, after ingestion of 150 g of fermented milk. The strains and their concentrations in the products were Lactobacillus fermentum KLD (107 cfu/g), Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826 (108 cfu/g), and Lactococcus lactis MG 1363 (108 cfu/g). Ileal fluid was aspirated by intestinal intubation and immediately cultured. L. plantarum NCIMB 8826, which was found in high concentrations in the ileum, was studied for its survival in the faeces after consumption of 150 g of fermented milk three times daily for 7 days. Faecal samples were collected for culture. RESULTS: The concentration of L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 in the ileum reached 108 cfu/mL after a single dose, with a survival of 7%. L. fermentum KLD and Lc. lactis MG 1363 had lower (0.5 and 1.0%, respectively) and shorter (4 h) survival in the ileum. During the 7-day ingestion period, L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 reached high concentrations (108 cfu/g) in the faeces, with a survival of 25 +/- 29%. None of the strains colonized. CONCLUSIONS: L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 has a promising pharmacokinetic profile as a candidate vaccine vehicle.
TI  - The effect of a commercial starter culture addition on the ripening of an artisanal goat's cheese (Cameros cheese).
AB  - The evolution of physicochemical parameters, and the most important microbial groups, were determined for the following three batches of 'Cameros' goat's milk cheese during ripening: Batch R elaborated with raw milk, Batch RS elaborated with raw milk and with the addition of a starter culture, and Batch PS elaborated with pasteurized milk and with the addition of the same culture. No differences in total solids (TS) or in the content of NaCl, fat and total nitrogen (expressed as percentages of TS) were found during the ripening. The pH, fat acidity and non-protein nitrogen (NPN, expressed as a percentage of TN) showed significant differences between the batches. The inoculated batches showed the fastest drop in pH at the beginning of the ripening period, but the cheeses of Batch R showed a higher degree of lipolysis and proteolysis. The addition of a starter influenced the microbiological quality of the cheeses. Differences in the counts of Enterobacteriaceae and faecal coliforms were found between Batches R and RS after 15 days. Staphylococcus aureus increased in number during the early period of ripening and attained a population above 6 log cfu g-1 in Batch R in the period from 5 to 10 days. However, enterotoxins were not detected in this Batch. Batch R showed lower values of lactic acid bacteria at the beginning of the ripening period, but no significant differences were found between batches in the period from 5 to 15 days of ripening. At the beginning of the ripening, Lactococcus was the main lactic acid bacteria, with L. lactis lactis being predominant. After 15 days, the lactic acid bacteria counts decreased in the three batches, especially in the cheeses of Batch PS (only 2.2 log cfu g-1 was found at 60 days), as lactococci (the only lactic acid bacteria present in Batch PS) are incapable of growing under the conditions found in cheeses at the end of their ripening period. At this time, Lactobacillus was the predominant genus in Batches R and RS, with L. plantarum predominant. No lactococci were found from day 30 in Batch R and from day 40 in Batch RS. The cheeses of Batch RS received the most favourable scores from the tasting panel for all attributes judged: cut appearance, colour, aroma, taste, texture and general acceptance.
TI  - Characterization and determination of origin of lactic acid bacteria from a sorghum-based fermented weaning food by analysis of soluble proteins and amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting.
AB  - The group that includes the lactic acid bacteria is one of the most diverse groups of bacteria known, and these organisms have been characterized extensively by using different techniques. In this study, 180 lactic acid bacterial strains isolated from sorghum powder (44 strains) and from corresponding fermented (93 strains) and cooked fermented (43 strains) porridge samples that were prepared in 15 households were characterized by using biochemical and physiological methods, as well as by analyzing the electrophoretic profiles of total soluble proteins. A total of 58 of the 180 strains were Lactobacillus plantarum strains, 47 were Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains, 25 were Lactobacillus sake-Lactobacillus curvatus strains, 17 were Pediococcus pentosaceus strains, 13 were Pediococcus acidilactici strains, and 7 were Lactococcus lactis strains. L. plantarum and L. mesenteroides strains were the dominant strains during the fermentation process and were recovered from 87 and 73% of the households, respectively. The potential origins of these groups of lactic acid bacteria were assessed by amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprint analysis.
TI  - Effect of inoculation of mesophilic lactic acid bacteria on microbial and sensory changes of minced goat meat during storage under vacuum and subsequent aerobic storage.
AB  - Minced goat meat inoculated with cell suspensions of Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis (Lc. lactis) or Lactobacillus plantarum was stored under vacuum in PETPE film at 4 degrees C and transferred to aerobic storage for 7 days in LDPE bags. During storage under vacuum, the lactic counts of the inoculated samples dropped followed by the development of spontaneous lactic flora. The pH of meat was lower in the treated samples than in the control. Towards the end of vacuum storage cell densities were lower than those in the control only for psychrotrophs in L. plantarum treatment and coliforms and staphylococcal counts in Lc. lactis treatment. There were increases in lactic counts in both treated and control samples during aerobic storage after previous vacuum storage of 18 days in trial 1 and 9 days in trial 2 with reductions in the counts of different bacterial groups and deterioration in colour of the treated samples compared with the control. When goat meat chunks were surface sanitized in alcohol and treated with lactic cell suspension and vacuum stored, there was development of acid and salty taste (acceptable) in the treated samples whereas the control showed a bland taste.
TI  - Use of green fluorescent protein to tag lactic acid bacterium strains under development as live vaccine vectors.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are safe microorganisms which are mainly used for  the preparation of fermented foods and for probiotic applications. The potential of LAB as live vehicles for the production and delivery of therapeutic molecules such as antigens is also being actively investigated today. However, very little is known about the fate of live LAB when administered in vivo and about the interaction of these microorganisms with the nasal or gastrointestinal ecosystem. For future applications, it is essential to be able to discriminate the biotherapeutic strain from the endogenous microflora and to unravel the mechanisms underlying the postulated health-beneficial effect. We therefore started to investigate both aspects in a mouse model with two LAB species presently under development as live vaccine vectors, i.e., Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. We have constructed different expression vectors carrying the gfp (green fluorescent protein [GFP]) gene from the jellyfish Aequoria victoria, and we found that this visible marker was best expressed when placed under the control of the inducible strong nisA promoter from L. lactis. Notably, a threshold amount of GFP was necessary to obtain a bright fluorescent phenotype. We further demonstrated that fluorescent L. plantarum NCIMB8826 can be enumerated and sorted by flow cytometry. Moreover, tagging of this strain with GFP allowed us to visualize its phagocytosis by macrophages in vitro and ex vivo and to trace it in the gastrointestinal tract of mice upon oral administration.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
AB  - The impact of a novel type of Modified Atmosphere (MA), referred to as high O2-MA, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter agglomerans, Aureobacterium strain 27, Candida guilliermondii, C. sake, Salmonella typhimurium, Salm. enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees C under an atmosphere composed of O2 (80 or 90%, balanced with N2), CO2 (10 or 20%, balanced with N2), or a combination of both gases. In general, exposure to high O2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while CO2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. Consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in combination. With minimally-processed vegetables, where CO2 levels of around 20% or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high O2 and 10-20% CO2 may provide adequate suppression of microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a Thai low-salt fermented  fish product and the role of garlic as substrate for fermentation.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from raw materials (fish, rice, garlic and banana leaves) and processed som-fak (a Thai low-salt fermented fish product) were characterized by API 50-CH and other phenotypic criteria. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc citreum were specifically associated with fish fillet and minced fish, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei with boiled rice and Weisella confusa with garlic mix and banana leaves. In addition, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus and Pediococcus pentosaceus were isolated from raw materials. A succession of aciduric, homofermentative lactobacillus species, dominated by Lb. plantarum/pentosus, was found during fermentation. In total, 9% of the strains fermented starch and 19% fermented garlic, the two main carbohydrate components in som-fak. The ability to ferment garlic was paralleled by a capacity to ferment inulin. An increased percentage of garlic fermenting strains was found during fermentation of som-fak, from 8% at day 1 to 40% at day 5. No starch fermenting strains were isolated during fermentation. Three mixed LAB cultures, composed of either starch fermenting Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, or garlic fermenting Lb. plantarum and Pd. pentosaceus, or a combination of these strains were inoculated into laboratory prepared som-fak with or without garlic. In som-fak without garlic, pH was above 4.8 after three days, irrespective of addition of mixed LAB cultures. The starch fermenting LAB were unable to ferment som-fak and sensory spoilage occurred after three days. Fermentation with the combined mix of starch and garlic fermenting strains led to production of 2.5% acid and a decrease in pH to 4.5 in two days. The fermentation was slightly slower with the garlic fermenting strains alone. This is the first report describing the role of garlic as carbohydrate source for LAB in fermented fish products.
TI  - The expression signals of the Lactobacillus brevis slpA gene direct efficient heterologous protein production in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A cassette based on the expression signals of the Lactobacillus brevis surface (S)-layer protein gene (slpA) was constructed. The low-copy-number vector pKTH2095, derived from pGK12, was used as the cloning vector. The efficiency of slpA promoters in intracellular protein production was studied using three reporter genes, beta-glucuronidase (gusA), luciferase (luc) and aminopeptidase N (pepN) in three different lactic acid bacteria hosts: Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus gasseri. The S-layer promoters were recognized in each strain and especially L. lactis and Lb. plantarum exhibited high levels of transcripts. The production kinetics of reporter proteins was studied as a function of growth. The GusA, Luc and PepN activities varied considerably among the lactic acid bacterial strains studied. The highest levels of beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity were obtained in L. lactis. The level of GusA obtained in L. lactis corresponded to over 15% of the total cellular proteins. The highest level of aminopeptidase N activity was achieved in Lb. plantarum where PepN corresponded up to 28% of the total cellular proteins at the late exponential phase of growth. This level of PepN activity is 30-fold higher than that in Lb. helveticus, which is the species from which the pepN gene originates.
TI  - Oat bran beta-gluco- and xylo-oligosaccharides as fermentative substrates for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The influence of oat bran oligosaccharides on carbohydrate utilization and fermentation end-products was studied with reference to three different lactic acid bacteria (LAB: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis). The main results were that all three LAB utilized oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides, while only L. plantarum utilized xylo-oligosaccharides. The main products of LAB metabolism were lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid and ethanol. The results indicated that oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides induce LAB to form the end-products of a typical mixed-acid fermentation. The formation of mixed-acid production from xylo-oligosaccharides was mainly due to the starvation of cells. This study indicates that oat bran oligosaccharides affect both qualitatively and quantitatively the fermentation end-products of LAB grown on these substrates. This should be taken into account when selecting strains for new fermented cereal based food products.
TI  - Production of cholera toxin B subunit in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The intracellular expression of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was first achieved in Lactobacillus paracasei LbTGS1.4 with an expression cassette including the P25 promoter of Streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed L. pentosus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhD). Secretion of CTB was next attempted in L. paracasei LbTGS1.4 and L. plantarum NCIMB8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis Usp45 and PrtP, Enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and S. pyogenes M6 protein). Host-dependent secretion of CTB was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable CTB in the extracellular fraction of L. paracasei LbTGS1.4, secretion of CTB molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in L. plantarum NCIMB8826.
TI  - Plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - Bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. During lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host chromosome at the 3' end of a tRNA(Ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (L. Dupont et al., J. Bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). A nonreplicative vector (pMC1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attP site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei (two strains), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Integrative recombination of pMC1 into the chromosomes of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pMC1 attP site. The isolation and sequencing of pMC1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pMC1 integrated into the conserved tRNA(Ser) gene. In the other bacterial species where this tRNA gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic DNA were used. A consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. The comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide CCT at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.
TI  - High level heterologous protein production in Lactococcus and Lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the Lactobacillus brevis S-layer signals.
AB  - A secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a S-layer  protein (SlpA) from Lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. E. coli beta-lactamase (Bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the S-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pGK12. In all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpA signals and all Bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. The Lb. brevis S-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in L. lactis, Lb. brevis and Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. gasseri the slpA promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in Lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. The production of Bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. The highest yield of Bla was obtained with L. lactis and Lb. brevis. Without pH control, substantial degradation of Bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) tested. When growing L. lactis and Lb. brevis under pH control, the Bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. L. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of Bla which to our knowledge represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by LAB so far. The short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) Bla molecules/cell per h. Such a high rate was also observed with Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpA gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of Bla production. The results obtained indicate wide applicability of the Lb. brevis slpA signals for efficient protein production and secretion in LAB.
TI  - Microbiological and biochemical characterization of cassava retting, a traditional lactic Acid fermentation for foo-foo (cassava flour) production.
AB  - The overall kinetics of retting, a spontaneous fermentation of cassava roots performed in central Africa, was investigated in terms of microbial-population evolution and biochemical and physicochemical parameters. During the traditional process, endogenous cyanogens were almost totally degraded, plant cell walls were lysed by the simultaneous action of pectin methylesterase and pectate lyase, and organic acids (C(inf2) to C(inf4)) were produced. Most microorganisms identified were found to be facultative anaerobes which used the sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) present in the roots as carbon sources. After 24 h of retting, the fermentation reached an equilibrium that was reproducible in all the spontaneous fermentations studied. Lactic acid bacteria were largely predominant (over 99% of the total flora after 48 h) and governed the fermentation. The epiphytic flora was first replaced by Lactococcus lactis, then by Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and finally, at the end of the process, by Lactobacillus plantarum. These organisms produced ethanol and high concentrations of lactate, which strongly acidified the retting juice. In addition, the rapid decrease in partial oxygen pressure rendered the process anaerobic. Strict anaerobes, such as Clostridium spp., developed and produced the volatile fatty acids (mainly butyrate) responsible, together with lactate, for the typical flavor of retted cassava. Yeasts (mostly Candida spp.) did not seem to play a significant role in the process, but their increasing numbers in the last stage of the process might influence the flavor and the preservation of the end products.
TI  - The application of pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes in lactic acid bacteria reveals  distinct extrusion systems for unmodified and conjugated dyes.
AB  - Intracellular pH in bacteria can be measured efficiently between internal pH values of 6.5 and 8.5 with the fluorescent pH indicator 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5[and-6]-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). A new fluorescent pH probe with a lower pKa(app) than BCECF was synthesized from fluorescein isothiocyanate and glutamate. The new probe, N-(fluorescein thio-ureanyl)-glutamate (FTUG), was much less sensitive to changes in concentrations of KCl than was BCECF. Similar to BCECF, an efflux of FTUG independent of the proton motive force, but dependent on ATP, was observed both in Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis. Corrections for probe efflux allowed accurate measurements of the pHin. Similar intracellular pH values were determined with FTUG and BCECF, in the range where both probes can be applied, and the pH values correlated well with those estimated from the distribution of radio-labelled benzoic acid. Since FITC can easily be coupled to substrates containing an amino group, it is possible to develop other FITC derivatives as well. The mechanisms of probe excretion and the nature of the excreted product(s) were studied in further detail for BCECF and FTUG. BCECF was excreted from wild-type L. lactis in an unmodified form as was determined by chromatographic and mass spectrometry analysis. In the case of FTUG, the excreted product was a conjugated derivative. Unmodified FTUG was not excreted, although it was present in cellular extracts from L. lactis. Exit of BCECF was completely inhibited in a BCECF efflux mutant (Bef-) of L. lactis, whereas FTUG-conjugate efflux in this mutant was similar to the wild-type. Addition of indomethacin, a known inhibitor of BCECF efflux in human epithelial cells, resulted in complete inhibition of BCECF efflux in wild-type L. lactis, whereas FTUG-conjugate exit was only slightly affected. The results of the mutant and inhibitor studies suggest that FTUG-conjugate and BCECF efflux in L. lactis are mediated by different ATP-driven extrusion systems for organic anions.
TI  - Positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (R/M) systems of different specificities. A novel IIS type R/M system encoded by the LlaI operon has previously been characterized from the L. lactis conjugative plasmid pTR2030. The LlaI operon is composed of six genes: First, a small regulatory gene llaIC precedes the methylase gene llaIM. The following three genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, llaI.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llaIR. The forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llaIR gene cassette. We have successfully subcloned the three llaIR genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, and llaI.3, without llaIM, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors pTRKL2, pTRKH2, and pBV5030. A promoter (P6) from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, which is functional in E. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (Djordjevic and Topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. Restriction activity was evaluated in Escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. The llaIR restriction cassette was not functional in E. coli, but its presence was lethal to L. lactis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Carnobacterium pisicola, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Leuconostoc gelidum. Several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llaIR cassette. Insertions in llaI.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. These positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. Functional activity of the llaIR genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
TI  - Comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  - A total of 169 Lactobacillus strains from 12 species (Lb. acidophilus, Lb. brevis, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lb. plantarum and Lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 Lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates and a tryptic digest of casein. Within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. Furthermore, differences were observed between the Lactobacillus species and Lc. lactis. Lb. helveticus had by far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. On the other hand, Lb. fermentum and Lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. A more detailed study with highly proteolytic Lactobacillus strains indicated that at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. Compared with Lc. lactis, the Lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.
TI  - Microbiology of pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough.
AB  - Mexican fermented maize dough, pozol, including traditional banana leaf-wrapped samples and material in plastic bags, was purchased. All samples were pH 4.7 to 5.7 approx. 12 h after preparation, pH declining to 3.6 to 3.9 after 6 to 9 days storage at ambient temperature. These latter samples had dry matter contents of 31% to 48% (w/w), 0.35% to 0.75% titratable acidity as lactic acid and lactic acid bacteria as predominant microbial flora at about 10(8) c.f.u./ml. The lactic acid bacteria included strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus confusus, Lactococcus lactis and Lactococcus raffinolactis. Fungi were not found in the samples stored in plastic bags. The samples wrapped in banana leaf, however, developed a large surface mycoflora within 2 days. This included Geotrichum candidum, yeasts and moulds. The majority of the lactic acid bacteria and approx. 50% of yeasts hydrolysed starch to some extent. No Geotrichum isolate hydrolysed starch. Lactate was assimilated by all the Geotrichum isolates and by 17 of 39 yeast strains.
TI  - Detection of polygalacturonases and pectin esterases in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Of 80 strains of lactic acid bacteria tested, only Lactobacillus casei strains HNK10 and L1-8, Lactobacillus plantarum Lc5 and Lactococcus lactis NN01 produced polygalacturonases (EC 3.2.1.) and/or pectin-esterases (EC 3.1.1.). Crude extracellular extracts of strain L1-8 were able to clarify pectin.
TI  - Specific antibody-mediated detection of Brochothrix thermosphacta in situ in British fresh sausage.
AB  - A rabbit polyclonal antibody-linked probe was developed which detected 76% of 800 food isolates of the spoilage bacterium Brochothrix thermosphacta when cells were bound to nitrocellulose. In slide cross-reaction tests all six environmental isolates tested were stained but the type strain was not. The antibody did not cross-react with Listeria grayi, L. monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus or B. subtilis. The antibody-linked probe detected Br. thermosphacta in thin sections of British fresh sausage when the viable count was greater than 10(6) g-1. Cells were detected mainly within 1 or 2 mm of the surface on the loose starchy material. They were not detected within muscle blocks or in the centre of the sausage. Such results suggest that growth of this organism occurs close to the surface of the sausage.
TI  - Expression of a chitinase gene from Serratia marcescens in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - A chitinase gene from the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens BJL200 was  cloned in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MG1363 and in the silage inoculum strain Lactobacillus plantarum E19b. The chitinase gene was expressed as an active enzyme at a low level in Lactococcus lactis, when cloned in the same transcriptional orientation as the gene specifying the replication protein of the vector pIL253. Using the expression vectors pMG36e and pGKV259 with lactococcal promoter fragments p32 and p59, the expression in L. lactis was increased nine- and 27-fold, respectively. An additional twofold increase was obtained after cloning the gene under the control of p59 in the high-copy number replicon pIL253. In Lactobacillus plantarum, chitinase activity was expressed from p32, and the activity was at the same level as under p32 control in L. lactis.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the plasmid encoded beta-D-galactosidase gene from a Lactobacillus plantarum strain of dairy origin.
AB  - The beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) gene from Lactobacillus plantarum C3.8 was cloned and expressed in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli. Hybridization experiments indicated that the gene is located on a plasmid and is present in other strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Its sequence is very similar to a Leuconostoc lactis beta-Gal gene. Expression of the gene, both in Lactobacillus plantarum and in Lactococcus lactis, was four-fold higher in cells growth in lactose compared to those grown in glucose. The presence of the beta-Gal gene in Lactococcus lactis allowed this bacterium to be efficient in clotting milk.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - Characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from Benin.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. Lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the Betabacterium group. They include L. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), L. fermentum or L. reuteri (19%), L. brevis (26%), L. confusus (less than 2%), L. curvatus (less than 1%) and L. buchneri (less than 1%). Other isolated lactic acid bacteria were L. salivarius, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by L. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and L. fermentum or L. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. The trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. No strains of L. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.
TI  - Nonidentity between plasmid and chromosomal copies of ISS1-like sequences in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis CNRZ270 and their possible role in chromosomal integration of plasmid genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of an insertion sequence (IS) observed during mating experiments using the lactose-protease plasmid, pUCL22, of Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis subsp. lactis CNRZ270, was found to be similar to that of ISS1 from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis ML3. The IS was named ISS1RS. The chromosome of this strain contains several copies of ISS1-like IS as assessed by hybridization. One of these copies was cloned and named ISS1CH. Its sequence differs from that of the plasmid-borne copy, and appears to be more closely related to ISS1N from Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11. This suggests independent introduction of both ISS1 elements. Moreover, the observation of plasmid genes integrated in the CNRZ270 chromosome near ISS1CH suggests that their presence is the result of integration by a Campbell mechanism using both IS homologies. ISS1-like sequences were also found on plasmids of numerous Lc. lactis strains, as well as one out of seven Lactobacillus (Lb.) casei and one out of three Lb. plantarum strains examined.
TI  - Accelerated natural lactic fermentation of cereal-based formulas at reduced water activity.
AB  - Energy required to dehydrate fermented cereal-based food formulas plays a significant part in the production cost. Therefore the effect of reduced moisture content on the fermentation was investigated. Generally, lactic fermentation at reduced moisture content resulted in increased final pH. Significant acidification still occurred at 0.33 kg water/kg dry matter corresponding to either aW = 0.925 in a sorghum-maize-soya (SMS) mixture, or aW = 0.950 in a sorghum-maize-milk powder (SMM) mixture. Acidification adequate for microbiological safety (pH < or = 4.5) was achieved at 0.54 kg water/kg dm in SMS (aW = 0.950) and 0.43 kg/kg dm in SMM (aW = 0.965). In stable accelerated natural lactic fermentations obtained by inoculum recycling ('back-slopping') at 30 degrees C, dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, L. acidophilus and Lactococcus lactis. Dominating yeasts were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida krusei. L. plantarum isolated from high-moisture (1.5 kg/kg dry matter) SMS fermentations had higher specific growth rates than L. plantarum isolated from reduced moisture (0.54 kg/kg dm) SMS fermentations, when tested under similar aW conditions. This effect was not caused by previous culturing conditions; probably different strains of L. plantarum having different aW-optima dominate at high or reduced moisture conditions.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the cell-envelope-associated proteinase from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NCDO 151.
AB  - The gene encoding the cell-envelope-associated proteinase of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NCDO 151 (formerly Lactobacillus casei NCDO 151) was cloned and sequenced. The gene was located on the chromosome and encoded a polypeptide of 1902 amino acids. The proteinase is N-terminally cleaved upon maturation. It shows extensive homology to the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 proteinase. Similar to the situation in Lactococcus, a maturation gene was found upstream of the proteinase gene. The cloned proteinase gene was expressed in Lactobacillus plantarum. However, no expression was observed when the gene was cloned in Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Novel paired starter culture system for sauerkraut, consisting of a nisin-resistant Leuconostoc mesenteroides strain and a nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis strain.
AB  - Nisin-resistant Leuconostoc mesenteroides NCK293 and nisin-producing Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis NCK401 were evaluated separately and in combination for growth and nisin production in a model sauerkraut fermentation. Strains were genetically marked and selectively enumerated by using antibiotic-containing media. The growth and survival of L. mesenteroides were similar in the presence and absence of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The growth of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was not inhibited, although the maximum cell density was reduced and the population decline was more pronounced in the presence of L. mesenteroides. Nisin was detected within 24 h, and levels were relatively constant over the 12-day test period. The maximum cell populations and nisin level achieved could be altered by changing the initial cell ratios of L. mesenteroides and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Isogenic nisin-producing and nisin-negative Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis derivatives were used in combination with nisin-resistant L. mesenteroides to demonstrate that nisin levels produced in mixed culture were sufficient to retard the onset of the growth of nisin-sensitive, homofermentative Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917.
TI  - Bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of Clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocinogenicity of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454, Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 43200, P. pentosaceus ATCC 43201, Lactobacillus plantarum BN, L. plantarum LB592, L. plantarum LB75, and Lactobacillus acidophilus N2 against Clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees C was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. All the strains, except L. acidophilus N2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of C. botulinum spores at 30 degrees C. L. plantarum BN, L. lactis ATCC 11454, and P. pentosaceus ATCC 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees C. Supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% NaCl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. Detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of L. plantarum BN and L. lactis ATCC 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees C. These results suggest that low levels of L. plantarum BN or L. lactis ATCC 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% NaCl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
TI  - Single-stranded DNA plasmid, vector construction and cloning of Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in Lactobacillus.
AB  - Vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to TaqI-digested DNA of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus plantarum. The minimal region of Lactobacillus plasmid DNA that was required for DNA replication was defined and a single-stranded DNA intermediate replication system was observed. Homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. It was shown that the constructed vectors, named pPSC20 and pPSC22, were transformable into L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. Using plasmid pPSC22, the alpha-amylase gene of Bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Ecology of accelerated natural lactic fermentation of sorghum-based infant food formulas.
AB  - Accelerated natural lactic fermentation of mixed sorghum-cowpea (Formula 1) and sorghum-milkpowder (Formula 2) infant food formulas was achieved by repetitive (60 fermentation cycles of 24 h each) use of the previous batch as an inoculum at a rate of 10% (w/w) and resulted in a gradual establishment of mixed populations of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. In Formula 1, early fermentation stages (fermentation cycles 1-4) were dominated by Leuconostoc and Lactococcus spp. which caused conditions inhibitive to yeasts. Probably due to micronutrient deficiencies, the former lactic acid bacteria were succeeded by a combination of Lactobacillus plantarum and Candida spp. achieving pH values 4.2-4.3. In formula 2, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus brevis consistently achieved pH 3.7-3.8, thereby allowing only a minority of yeasts, mainly Candida and Trichosporon spp. None of the isolated yeasts exhibited 'killer'-activity.
TI  - Secretion of TEM beta-lactamase with signal sequences isolated from the chromosome of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - With TEM beta-lactamase as a reporter gene, a set of expression-secretion-promoting fragments were isolated from the chromosome of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The fact that only translocated beta-lactamase renders cells resistant to ampicillin allowed direct ampicillin selection with an Escherichia coli vector (pKTH33). The clones showing the greatest ampicillin resistance were subcloned onto a replicon capable of replication in lactic acid bacteria (pVS2), and the nucleotide sequences of the relevant fragments were determined. The structure of the secretion-promoting fragments in general resembled that of gram-positive true signal sequences, with a strongly positively charged N terminus, a long hydrophobic core, and a putative signal peptidase recognition site. The promoterlike sequences preceding the signal sequences matched well with those of previously published lactococcal promoters. In addition to E. coli, the functioning of these expression-secretion cassettes was studied in three gram-positive hosts: Bacillus subtilis, L. lactis, and Lactobacillus plantarum. Efficient expression and secretion of TEM beta-lactamase into the culture medium of each gram-positive host was obtained. Furthermore, when a strain of L. lactis subsp. lactis showing increased sensitivity to lysozyme was compared with a standard laboratory strain, threefold-higher secreted enzyme activities were detected.
TI  - Microbiology of 'obiolor': a Nigerian fermented non-alcoholic beverage.
AB  - Obiolor is an acidic non-alcoholic beverage prepared by fermenting sorghum and millet malts. The traditional process for the production and microbiological characteristics of the beverage were investigated. Bacillus spp., Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus lactis were the associated micro-organisms most actively involved. Yeasts were present in low numbers towards the end of the fermentation. Other micro-organisms isolated did not appear to play a role in the fermentation process. Variations in the important microbial groups involved and their metabolic products were studied. Titratable acidity increased gradually until the end of the fermentation while the total soluble solids and pH declined. Acetobacter spp. were probably responsible for the unacceptability of the product after 24 h.
TI  - Isolation of a replication region of a large lactococcal plasmid and use in cloning of a nisin resistance determinant.
AB  - The replication region of a 28-kilobase-pair (kbp) cryptic plasmid from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis SSD207 was cloned in L. lactis subsp. lactis MG1614 by using the chloramphenicol resistance gene from the streptococcal plasmid pGB301 as a selectable marker. The resulting 8.1-kbp plasmid, designated pVS34, was characterized further with respect to host range, potential cloning sites, and location of replication gene(s). In addition to lactococci, pVS34 transformed Lactobacillus plantarum and, at a very low frequency, Staphylococcus aureus but not Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. The 4.1-kbp ClaI fragment representing lactococcal DNA in pVS34 contained unique restriction sites for HindIII, EcoRI, XhoII, and HpaII, of which the last three could be used for molecular cloning. A region necessary for replication was located within a 2.5-kbp fragment flanked by the EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites. A 3.8-kbp EcoRI fragment derived from a nisin resistance plasmid, pSF01, was cloned into the EcoRI site of pVS34 to obtain a nisin-chloramphenicol double-resistance plasmid, pVS39. From this plasmid, the streptococcal chloramphenicol resistance region was subsequently eliminated. The resulting plasmid, pVS40, contains only lactococcal DNA. Potential uses for this type of a nisin resistance plasmid are discussed.
TI  - Influence of aflatoxin B1 on gas production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The main characteristic of homofermentative lactic acid bacteria is that they do  not produce gas from glucose and other sugars. However, in these experiments Lactobacillus casei, Lb. plantarum and Streptococcus lactis in broth media with glucose, galactose, lactose and sucrose, and aflatoxin B1 produces acid and also a significant amount of gas. In the control media without aflatoxin, these bacteria did not produce gas. The data suggest that lactic acid bacteria, known until now as homofermentative, become heterofermentative because of the influence of aflatoxin B1. The results of these investigations are of practical value because they may explain the defect of cheese "blowing," which can appear in Trapist cheese vacuum packed in foil. This type of unusual "blowing" occurs approximately one month after cheese manufacture. This defect can be characterized by very large holes and cracks inside the cheese. The flavor is similar to that of young cheese, which can be very undesirable for a ripened, Trapist, aged cheese.
TI  - Bacterial growth in mastitic whey in relation to bacterial association with mastitis.
AB  - The growth of mastitis pathogens (eight strains) and non-pathogenic bacteria (eight strains) was studied using microturbidometry. All bacteria grew well in whey originating from uninflamed quarters. However, the growth of bacteria which are not considered to be mastitis pathogens (Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) became suppressed by whey from mastitic quarters. On the contrary, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was generally better in mastitic samples. Streptococcus agalactiae showed inconsistent results.
TI  - Influence of lactic starter inoculation, curd heating and ripening temperature on Staphylococcus aureus behaviour in Manchego cheese.
AB  - Growth and survival of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated in 52 lots of raw  ewe's milk Manchego cheese manufactured and ripened under different conditions. A 5.8-fold reduction in S. aureus counts after 60 days of ripening was obtained by inoculating milk with 1% Streptococcus lactis culture, and a further 2.0-fold reduction could be achieved by adding 0.1% Lactobacillus plantarum culture. Curd heating temperature had a significant effect on S. aureus survival, with counts 4-5 times lower in cheese from 30 degrees C curd than in cheese from curd heated at 36-40 degrees C. Ripening temperature was the parameter with the greatest influence on S. aureus counts, which reached in cheese cured at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C for 60 days levels 10 and 100 times lower, respectively, than in cheese held at 5 degrees C.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk with special reference  to the biodegradation of casein fractions.
AB  - Streptococci and lactobacilli were assayed for their proteolytic activity in pasteurised (95 degrees C for 30 min) fresh Friesian cows' skim milk incubated at 30 degrees C for 48 h. Lactobacilli were more proteolytic than the streptococci except S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens. S. faecalis and S. thermophilus followed S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis in the proteolytic activity. Electrophoretic analysis of the precipitated casein revealed K-, pre-beta- and the small slow band of alpha s1-casein to be the most fractions and beta-casein the least fraction susceptible to the biodegradation. S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was the only organism able to degrade beta-casein to 3 fractions within 48 h. S. lactis with its subsp. diacetylactis was characterized by its inability to degrade gamma-casein. Addition of 2.0 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 2.0 mmol Mg2+, 0.5 mmol Mn2+ and 0.1 mmol Fe2+/l of skim milk culture of each L. casei and L. plantarum increased acid formation but decreased proteolysis. 6% NaCl was inhibitory to both. After 60 days at 18 degrees C, a fraction, probably derived from beta-casein, was noticeable. The large intense band of alpha s1-casein appears to be degraded gradually to only small peptides which in turn are transferred immediately into the cells. The hydrolysis of gamma-casein and beta-casein also appears to be inhibited by exogenously supplied NaCl and nutrients, respectively.
