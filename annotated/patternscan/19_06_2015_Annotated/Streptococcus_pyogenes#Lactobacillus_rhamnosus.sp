TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg inhibits invasion of cultured human respiratory cells  by prtf1-positive macrolide-resistant group a streptococci.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to determine whether the probiotic strain lactobacillus gg, which is extensively used in the treatment and prevention of intestinal disorders, is able to inhibit invasion of cultured human respiratory cells by macrolide-resistant group a streptococci (gas) carrying the prtf1 gene,  which encodes the fibronectin (fn)-binding invasin f1. methods and results: eight prtf1-positive erythromycin-resistant gas strains were used to infect a549 monolayers in competition and displacement assays with lactobacillus gg. live (l-lgg) and heat-killed (hk-lgg) lactobacilli and their spent culture supernatant (scs) significantly reduced (p < 0.001) gas invasion efficiency in both assays. no antibacterial activity of lactobacillus gg against gas was detected. both l-lgg and hk-lgg and all prtf1-positive gas induced a strong agglutination reaction using fn-coated particles. conclusions: lactobacillus gg exerts an antagonistic action against gas by inhibiting cell invasion. competitive binding  of lactobacillus gg and gas to fn might be involved in the inhibition process. significance and impact of the study: the finding that lactobacillus gg can prevent in vitro invasion of respiratory cells by gas suggests new applications for this probiotic strain and warrants further studies of its capacity to prevent gas throat infections.

TI  == live lactobacillus rhamnosus and streptococcus pyogenes differentially regulate toll-like receptor (tlr) gene expression in human primary macrophages.
AB  == macrophages are phagocytes that recognize bacteria and subsequently activate appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses. tlrs are essential in identifying conserved bacterial structures and in initiating and mediating innate immune responses. in this work, we have characterized tlr gene expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages in response to stimulation with two live gram-positive bacteria, a human commensal and probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and an important human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. lgg and s. pyogenes enhanced tlr2 expression in macrophages. lgg and s. pyogenes also required tlr2 for nf-kappab activation. only pathogenic s. pyogenes was able to up-regulate tlr3 and tlr7 gene expression. this up-regulation was dependent on ifn-alpha/beta, as neutralizing anti-ifn-alpha/beta antibodies reduced s. pyogenes-induced tlr3 and tlr7 mrna expression. our results show that despite similarities, tlr responses of macrophages differ for a gram-positive probiotic and a pathogen. our data suggest that macrophages can discriminate between probiotic and pathogenic bacteria by ifn-mediated tlr gene regulation.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus rhamnosus differentially induce maturation and production of th1-type cytokines and chemokines in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are the most efficient antigen-presenting cells and thus, have a major role in regulating host immune responses. in the present study, we have analyzed the ability of gram-positive, pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes and nonpathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus to induce the maturation of human monocyte-derived dcs. stimulation of dcs with s. pyogenes resulted in strong expression of dc costimulatory molecules cd80, cd83, and cd86 accompanied with a  t helper cell type 1 (th1) cytokine and chemokine response. s. pyogenes also induced interleukin (il)-2 and il-12 production at mrna and protein levels. in addition, il-23 and il-27 subunits p40, p19, p28, and ebi3 were induced at mrna level. in contrast, l. rhamnosus-stimulated dcs showed only moderate expression of costimulatory molecules and produced low levels of cytokines and chemokines. furthermore, no production of il-2 or il-12 family cytokines was detected. bacteria-induced dc maturation and especially cytokine and chemokine production were reduced when bacteria were heat-inactivated. our results show that human monocyte-derived dcs respond differently to different gram-positive bacteria. although pathogenic s. pyogenes induced a strong th1-type response, stimulation with nonpathogenic l. rhamnosus resulted in development of semi-mature dcs characterized by moderate expression of costimulatory molecules and low cytokine  production.

TI  == lactobacilli and streptococci induce inflammatory chemokine production in human macrophages that stimulates th1 cell chemotaxis.
AB  == macrophages have a central role in innate-immune responses to bacteria. in the present work, we show that infection of human macrophages with gram-positive pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes or nonpathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg enhances mrna expression of inflammatory chemokine ligands ccl2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), ccl3/macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (mip-1alpha), ccl5/regulated on activation, normal t expressed and secreted, ccl7/mcp-3, ccl19/mip-3beta, and ccl20/mip-3alpha and cxc chemokine ligands cxcl8/interleukin (il)-8, cxcl9/monokine induced by interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), and cxcl10/ifn-inducible protein 10. bacteria-induced ccl2, ccl7, cxcl9, and cxcl10 mrna expression was partially dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. the  expression of these chemokines and of ccl19 was dependent on bacteria-induced ifn-alpha/beta production. ccl19 and ccl20 mrna expression was up-regulated by il-1beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and in addition, ifn-alpha together with tnf-alpha further enhanced ccl19 gene expression. synergy between ifn-alpha and tnf-alpha was also seen for cxcl9 and cxcl10 mrna expression. bacteria-stimulated macrophage supernatants induced the migration of t helper cell type 1 (th1) cells, suggesting that in human macrophages, these bacteria can stimulate efficient inflammatory chemokine gene expression including those that recruit th1 cells to the site of inflammation. furthermore, l. rhamnosus-induced  th1 chemokine production could in part explain the proposed antiallergenic properties of this bacterium.

TI  == lactobacilli and streptococci activate nf-kappa b and stat signaling pathways in  human macrophages.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria induce the production of several cytokines in human leukocytes. the molecular mechanisms involved in gram-positive bacteria-induced cytokine production have been poorly characterized. in this work we demonstrate that both nonpathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci) induce nf-kappa b and stat dna-binding activity in human primary macrophages as analyzed by emsa. nf-kappa b activation was rapid and was not inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting  that these bacteria could directly activate nf-kappa b. stat1, stat3, and ifn regulatory factor-1 dna binding was induced by both bacteria with delayed kinetics compared with nf-kappa b. in addition, streptococci induced the formation of ifn-alpha-specific transcription factor complex and ifn-stimulated gene factor-3 (isgf3). stat1 and stat3 activation and isgf3 complex formation were inhibited by cycloheximide or by neutralization with ifn-alpha/beta-specific abs. streptococci were more potent than lactobacilli in inducing stat1, isgf3, and ifn regulatory factor-1 dna binding. accordingly, only streptococci induced ifn-alpha production. the activation of the ifn-alpha signaling pathway by streptococci could play a role in the pathogenesis of these bacteria. these results indicate that extracellular gram-positive bacteria activate transcription factors involved in cytokine signaling by two mechanisms: directly, leading to nf-kappa b activation, and indirectly via cytokines, leading to stat activation.
