heterologous protein display on the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria mediated by the s-layer protein.
background: previous studies have revealed that the c-terminal region of the s-layer protein from lactobacillus is responsible for the cell wall anchoring, which provide an approach for targeting heterologous proteins to the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the c-terminal region of s-layer protein slpb of lactobacillus crispatus k2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine.
results: multiple sequence alignment revealed that the c-terminal region (lcsb) of lb. crispatus k2-4-3 slpb had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains sa and cbsa of lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. crispatus. to evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (gfp) or beta-galactosidase (gal) was fused to the n-terminus of the lcsb region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in escherichia coli, respectively. after mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused gfp-lcsb and gal-lcsb were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. in addition, the binding capacity could be improved by sds pretreatment.
moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell.
furthermore, when the fused dna fragment of gfp:lcsb was inserted into the lactococcus lactis expression vector psec:leiss:nuc, the gfp could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisa promoter.
western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and sds sensitivity analysis confirmed that the gfp was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of l. lactis with the aid of the lcsb anchor.
conclusion: the lcsb region can be used as a functional scaffold to target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.
