TI  - Bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) production in Aeromonas hydrophila water isolates.
AB  - 30 Aeromonas hydrophila water isolates were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more indicator microorganisms, but the activity emerged only with non-phylogenetically related genera or species. In particular all A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more of the tested Staphylococcus strains, five against Listeria spp. (Listeria seeligeri, Listeria welshimeri and Listeria ivanovii), and eight presented a weak antagonistic activity towards Streptococcus agalactiae and Lactobacillus spp. Inhibitory activity was not observed against the other Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative tested strains, including Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae and the same A. hydrophila, when used as indicator. Anti-staphylococcal activity was observed with a gradual increase of the inhibition zone during incubation and seemed to be influenced by A. hydrophila hemolytic expression. Extrachromosomal analysis showed the presence, in 70% of the strains, of one to five plasmids with molecular masses ranging from 2.1 to 41.5 MDa, but it was not possible to relate this result with BLS production.
