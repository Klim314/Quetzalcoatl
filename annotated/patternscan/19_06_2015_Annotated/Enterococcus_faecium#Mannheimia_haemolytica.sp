TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == towards the establishment and standardization of a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in south africa.
AB  == the objective of this study was to establish a repeatable, standardized laboratory procedure for monitoring the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from animals and food of animal origin in south africa, with reagents prepared in-house. the emergence of resistance and the spread of resistant bacteria can be limited by implementing a veterinary antimicrobial drug policy, in which inter alia systematic monitoring and prudent use play essential  roles. the bacteria included in this study represented three different categories, namely zoonotic bacteria (salmonella), indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) and veterinary pathogens (mannheimia haemolytica). thirty isolates of each species were collected with the aim of standardizing the laboratory methodology for a future national veterinary surveillance and monitoring programme. susceptibility to ten  selected antimicrobial drugs was determined by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the microdilution method. the method according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used as the standard. multi-well plates containing varying dilutions of antimicrobial drugs and prepared in-house for mic determinations, yielded repeatable results. storage of  plates for 2 months at -70 degrees c did not influence results meaningfully. within this limited sample of bacteria, mic results did not indicate meaningful resistance against any of the ten selected antimicrobial drugs. the findings of the study will be used to establish a national veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in south africa. to allow for international comparison of data, harmonisation of the surveillance and monitoring programme in accordance with global trends is encouraged. ideally it should be combined with a programme monitoring the quantities of antimicrobial drugs used. the aim is to contribute to slowing down the emergence of resistance  and the problems associated with this phenomenon by means of the rational use of  antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == bacteriology and somatic cell counts in milk samples from ewes on a scottish farm.
AB  == milk samples from 50 sheep on a single scottish research farm were collected weekly for 10 wk postpartum. samples were analyzed for somatic cell counts (scc)  each week and bacteriologic culture was done for 7 of the 10 wk. a total of 492 udder half samples were cultured, of which 467 had corresponding cell count data. statistical analysis on complete scc and culture data showed no association between scc and bacterial isolation, even when more than 10 colonies of a single  bacterial species were present. only 3.6% of the samples were simultaneously positive for high count (> 10 colonies from 0.01 ml of milk) of any one bacterial species and high scc (> 1 x 10(6)/ml). the bacteria recovered were: staphylococcus equorum (19 times), s. xylosus (7 times), s. simulans (6 times), streptococcus uberis (3 times) and other streptococci (4 times), mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica (2 times), staphylococcus aureus (1 time), s. capitis (1 time), and enterococcus faecium (1 time). there was an association between the test day and scc, with higher scc values in the first 2 wk. in addition, significantly higher scc values were found in the oldest animals compared to the  other age groups.
