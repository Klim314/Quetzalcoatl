TI  == alcohol and tobacco consumption affects bacterial richness in oral cavity mucosa  biofilms.
AB  == background: today there are more than 2 billion alcohol users and about 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide. the chronic and heavy use of these two substances is at the heart of numerous diseases and may wreak havoc on the human  oral microbiome. this study delves into the changes that alcohol and tobacco may  cause on biofilms of the human oral microbiome. to do so, we used swabs to sample the oral biofilm of 22 subjects; including 9 control-individuals with no or very  low consumption of alcohol and no consumption of tobacco, 7 who were chronic and  heavy users of both substances and 6 active smokers that reported no significant  alcohol consumption. dna was extracted from swabs and the v1 region of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced using the ion torrent pgm platform, generating 3.7 million high quality reads. dna sequences were clustered and otus  were assigned using the arb silva database and qiime. results: we found no differences in species diversity and evenness among the groups. however, we found a significant decrease in species richness in only smokers and in smokers/drinkers when compared to controls. we found that neisseria abundance was significantly decreased in both groups when compared to controls. smokers had significant increases in prevotella and capnocytophaga and reductions in granulicatella, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus and gemella when compared to the two other groups. controls showed higher abundance of aggregibacter, whilst smokers/drinkers had lower abundances of fusobacteria. samples from only smokers  clustered closer together than to controls and smokers/drinkers, and also had a significant reduction in inter-group dissimilarity distances, indicating a more homogenous group than controls. conclusions: our results indicate that the continued use of tobacco or alcohol plus tobacco significantly reduces bacterial  richness, which apparently leads to a reduction in inter-group variability, turning the respective biofilms into a more homogenous microenvironment in terms  of bacterial community composition, with possible consequences for human oral diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == delayed-onset infections after impacted lower third molar extraction: involved bacteria and sensitivity profiles to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == objectives: the objectives of this study were to identify the bacteria involved in delayed-onset infections after lower third molar removal and to determine the  most suitable antibiotic for such complication. study design: bacterial samples were collected from 13 patients who developed delayed-onset infections after lower third molar extraction. after the identification of the bacterial isolates, the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolated strains was determined. results: a total of 11 patients (12 samples) were finally included in the study.  up to 7 bacteria genera were identified. fusobacterium sp. was present in 11 patients, prevotella sp. in 8 cases, and peptostreptococcus sp. in 7. some strains of these bacteria were not susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and metronidazol, whereas no resistances were found to clindamycin. conclusions: fusobacterium sp., prevotella sp., and peptostreptococcus sp. are frequently present in delayed-onset infections after lower third molar removal. based on the results of the microbial susceptibility tests, clindamycin seems to be the most adequate antibiotic for the treatment of  this complication.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == [repression of bacterial biofilms in suppurative necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome by ultrasound cavitation].
AB  == aim: study of wound microbial landscape in suppurative necrotic complications in  patients with diabetic foot syndrome (dfs), and a possibility of suppression of bacterial biofilm development in these wounds by ultrasound cavitation (usc). materials and methods: 2 randomized groups of patients were included in the study: main group of 145 individuals with suppurative necrotic complications of dfs, who received ultrasound cavitation therapy, and comparison group of 86 patients who received basic therapy. in the main group sonoca-180 (siring, germany) unit, that allows to combine the process of mechanical wound treatment with antibacterial action of low frequency ultrasound, was used for wound treatment. quantitative and qualitative composition of wound microflora was studied by using bacteriological method with parallel utilization of transmission and scanning electron microscopy in the dynamic of usc treatment. results: in patients with dfs bacterial biofilms containing congestions in the polysaccharide matrix and fixed at the surface of dense structure of periostenum wound were detected. in the microbial landscape in dfs patients in 21% of cases aerobic-anaerobic microflora was detected, while associations included mostly from 2 to 5 bacteria species--members of the peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, bacteroides genera. bacteria of staphylococcus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, escherichia and klebsiella sp. genera were detected less frequently. application of usc in the main group resulted in a decrease of microbial contamination of wounds in the short-term. conclusion: usc method, when compared  with classical therapy approach in dfs complications, in patients with suppurative necrotic complications allows not only to remove mechanically the necrotic tissues but also to effectively suppress the bacterial biofilms that have formed in the wounds, this promotes the acceleration of recovery process and preparation of the patients for further plastic surgery intervention.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == frequency, microbial interactions, and antimicrobial susceptibility of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum isolated from primary endodontic infections.
AB  == this study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the e-test. one hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. f. nucleatum was found in 38  root canals and was associated with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., and eubacterium spp. f. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with peptostreptococcus prevotii. the simultaneous presence of f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). they were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in brazil.

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == severe versus local odontogenic bacterial infections: comparison of microbial isolates.
AB  == aim: it was the aim of this study to evaluate the clinical and microbiological differences between severe and local odontogenic abscesses. methods: thirty patients were prospectively enrolled. sixteen of 30 patients suffered from a severe life-threatening abscess of the head and neck, whereas 14/30 patients presented with a localized submucous abscess. anaerobic bacteria were identified  and susceptibility testing was performed using e test strips for penicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, imipenem + cilastatin, clindamycin and metronidazole. results: the mean duration until removal of all drains was 14.1 and 3.5 days, respectively. anaerobic bacteria were found in all episodes of local abscesses, whereas 19% of the severe episodes were culture negative, and in 13%, only aerobes were identified. a total of 60 anaerobes were isolated from 27  patients (2.2 isolates/positive sample). the dominating species were prevotella sp. (n = 17), peptostreptococcus sp. (n = 15) and propionibacterium sp. (n = 5).  eighty-seven percent of the isolates were susceptible to penicillin. ninety-seven percent of the anaerobes were susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, imipenem + cilastatin, and clindamycin. eighty-three percent were susceptible to  metronidazol. there was a tendency for a higher rate of episodes with penicillin-resistant bacteria in the patients with severe abscesses (14 vs. 31%). no difference in susceptibility regarding amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin (7%) was observed.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to analyze the microbiology of peritonsillar abscesses. methods: thirty patients, mean age 24,2 years, with peritonsillar abscesses underwent aspiration of at least 3 ml of pus, which was cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. results: 87% samples showed positive cultures. aerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria were isolated from 23% aspirates, mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 60%, and anaerobic bacteria  from only 3% aspirate. a total of 69 bacterial isolates (34 aerobic and 35 anaerobic) were recovered. the most common aerobic isolate was streptococcus sp,  with streptococcus pyogenes being identified in 23% of aspirates. the predominant anaerobic isolates were prevotella sp and peptostreptococcus sp. patients had received previous antimicrobial therapy in 63% cases. in this group, 1.8 isolates per specimen were recovered, a lower number than in the untreated group (3.0 per  specimen). no significant difference in the species isolated was observed between these two groups. conclusion: peritonsillar abscess is usually a polymicrobial infection, with predominance of anaerobic bacteria. the number of agents isolated was larger in patients not previously treated with antibiotics, but the use of antimicrobial drugs did not interfere with the type of bacterium isolated.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  == at present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. the objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the estonian population. in total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. the anaerobes were isolated on wilkins-chalgren agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam  by e-tests. the results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of nccls. data from the estonian state agency of medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). the following species of anaerobes were isolated: b. fragilis group, bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified gram-positive rods. metronidazole resistance was not found among gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in estonia. only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent  in vitro activity against all anaerobes. unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. in the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (ddd/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. high resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. we would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

AB  == because oral infections are common, the physician must understand the underlying  etiology, pathogeny, and other variables that determine how these processes evolve in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic drug. the special characteristics of the oral cavity determine the make-up of the microflora that lives there. different anaerobic species belonging to the peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, gemella, and porphyromonas genera are of particular interest, as are the aerobic species streptococcus, staphylococcus, and corynebacterium. each of these microorganisms occupies a different microniche within the oral cavity, and the prevailing balance is upset when conditions become modified as a result of illness or due to dental interventions such as tooth extraction or tooth scaling and polishing. pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (actinomyces, prevotella intermedia species, etc.) can develop in these  conditions, as can yeasts (candida sp., histoplasma capsulatum), virus (herpes simplex, papilomavirus), and parasites (entamoeba gingivalis, trichomonas tenax). when infection occurs, the patients s immune system reacts by means of inborn immunity (non-specific) and acquired immunity (specific). empirical treatment is  administered that should be based on etiological data and on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the pathogen that is causing the infection. however, oral microflora sensitivity to different antibiotics is currently declining and there  is a noticeable trend towards resistances. as a consequence of all this, the treatment of oral infections must also aim to restore the ecological balance of the oral cavity and to minimize the emergence of resistance in the microorganisms present in the mouth. hence, epidemiological oral pathogen sensitivity studies must be conducted, fostering the administration of appropriate antibiotics at proper doses and keeping specialists abreast of the latest trends. in recent decades, oral infections comprise one of the most common pathologies in the general population, due in large part to infectious complications associated with poor oral hygiene. this in turn, translates into an increased need and demand for dental care, while at the same time, it requires that the professional accurately understand the etiological factors involved, as well as the pathogeny and different variables that determine the specificity of these kinds of infections,  so as to be able to choose the appropriate antimicrobial drugs for proper treatment.

TI  == relationship of subgingival and salivary microbiota to gingival overgrowth in heart transplant patients following cyclosporin a therapy.
AB  == background: severe gingival overgrowth (go) is induced in patients taking cyclosporin a (csa) following organ transplantation. determining which patient will develop go is still not possible. the purpose of this study was to establish an association between csa and gingival overgrowth in heart transplant patients taking into account periodontal and microbiological conditions. methods: thirty patients (10 female, 20 male; range: 13 to 67 years; mean age: 44.89) undergoing  csa treatment were evaluated using the gingival index (gi), plaque index (pi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival samples collected from the deepest site of each quadrant and saliva samples were submitted to microbial analysis. all patients had at least 12 teeth. exclusion criteria were the use of antibiotics and/or having undergone periodontal treatment 6 months prior to the study. patients were divided in two groups: with  gingival (go+) and without gingival overgrowth (go-). results: there were no statistically significant differences between the go+ and go- groups when csa dosage, time since transplant, gi, pi, pd, and cal were compared. microbiological examination of the subgingival samples detected the following microorganisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), porphyromonas gingivalis (36%), prevotella intermedia (93%), fusobacterium sp. (66%), campylobacter rectus (30%), micromonas micros (66%), enteric rods (0%), and yeasts (30%). a positive association between m. micros and the go+ group was found (p < 0.001). yeasts were detected in 30% of the subgingival and saliva samples. conclusions: clinical parameters were not sufficient to determine which patients would develop go. however, colonization by m. micros might play a role in the etiology of go.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == bacteremia following surgical dental extraction with an emphasis on anaerobic strains.
AB  == our aim was to investigate bacteremia caused by surgical extraction of partly erupted mandibular third molars. from 16 young adults, bacterial samples were taken from the third-molar pericoronal pocket and post-operatively from the extraction socket, and blood samples were drawn from the ante-cubital vein up to  30 min after surgery. of the subjects, 88% had detectable bacteremia-50% 1 min after the incision, 44% immediately after extraction. the respective percentages  at 10, 15, and 30 min were 44%, 25%, and 13%. blood cultures contained 31 species (74% anaerobes), with 3.9 +/- 2.6 species isolated per subject. most prevalent were the anaerobes prevotella, eubacterium, and peptostreptococcus sp. and the aerobes viridans-group streptococci and streptococcus milleri group. any species  found in the blood was also isolated from the mouth, from 93% of the pericoronal  pockets and from 43% of the extraction sockets. surgical dental extraction clearly causes bacteremia of a high frequency and lasting longer than thus far assumed.

TI  == distribution of periodontal pathogens in korean aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: microbial associations in aggressive periodontitis versus different ethnic origins are substantially unknown. we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of seven putative periodontopathogens in korean patients and to evaluate microbial differences in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. methods: thirty-nine aggressive periodontitis patients between 20 and 35 years old (24 males and 15 females; mean age 29.6 years) were selected according to clinical criteria. the patients were subclassified into 17  localized and 22 generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. in each of the 39 individuals, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four diseased teeth (> or = 6 mm probing depth, 156 sites) and one healthy site (< or = 3 mm probing  depth, 39 sites). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the 16s ribosomal rna gene fragments (about 530 bp) of plaque bacteria and their subsequent detection by dot-blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes were performed to determine the presence of seven periodontopathogens. results: the prevalences were 75% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 94.2% for tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), 99.4% for fusobacterium sp., 85.9% for micromonas micros (formerly peptostreptococcus micros), 96.8% for porphyromonas gingivalis, 78.8% for prevotella intermedia, and 96.8% for treponema sp. the prevalences of these bacteria were significantly higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites. logistic regression analysis showed that p. intermedia was more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis than the localized form, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% confidence interval 1.26-8.56, p = 0.015). conclusions: our results demonstrate that the seven periodontal pathogens analyzed are strongly associated with korean aggressive periodontitis. in particular, p. intermedia are more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis, a more severe and progressive form, than with localized aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

(8), 1-16 mg/l for f. nucleatum (14), 0.12-0.5 mg/l for w. recta (2), 0.5-32  mg/l for e. corrodens, 0.5-2 mg/l for b. forsythus (2); < or =0.06-64 mg/l for peptostreptococcus sp. (11), < or =0.06-1 mg/l for a. odontolyticus (11) and for  a. naeslundii (7) and < or =0.06-16 mg/l for a. viscosus (7). macrolide activity  was ranked in decreasing order from flurithromycin to erythromycin to spiramycin. beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in prevotella sp. (20%) and in f. nucleatum (7%). isolates which were beta-lactamase negative but resistant to penicillin were found among peptostreptococcus sp. and actinomyces sp. a post-antibiotic effect of 2 hours was seen for flurithromycin on p. gingivalis and e. corrodens. the good in vitro activity of flurithromycin against bacteria supposed to cause periodontitis suggests clinical potential in the treatment of these diseases.

TI  == microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.

TI  == detection of major putative periodontopathogens in korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the frequency of recovery of potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity of sinusitis prone (sp) children, with their recovery in non-sinusitis prone (n-sp) children. nasopharyngeal and nasal cultures were taken from 20 sp and 20 n-sp children. potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these micro-organisms were identified. twenty-one potential pathogens (1.05 patient) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures from 14 of the 20 sp children, and 10 (0.5 patient) were  recovered from 6 of the 20 nsp (p < 0.05). bacterial interference between two aerobic (alpha and non-haemolytic streptococci) and two anaerobic species (prevotella and peptostreptococcus species) and four potential pathogens was observed. bacterial interference was noted in 64 instances against 4 potential pathogens by 24 normal flora isolates that were recovered from 7 of the sp group  and in 144 instances by 47 isolates from 18 of the nsp group (p < 0.05). nineteen potential pathogens (0.95/patient) were isolated from nasal cultures of 13 of the 20 sp children and 8 (0.4/patient) were recovered from 5 of the 20 nsp (p < 0.05). bacterial interference by similar micro-organisms was noted in 21 instances by 9 normal flora isolates that were recovered from 5 of the sp group,  and in 63 instances by 26 isolates from 15 of the nsp group (p < 0.05). our findings illustrate for the first time that the nasopharyngeal and nasal flora of nsp children contains more aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms with interfering capability and less potential pathogens than that of sp children.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == microbiology of cervical lymphadenitis in adults.
AB  == the microbiology of needle aspirates from 40 inflamed cervical lymph glands was studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. forty-two bacterial, 11 mycobacterial and six fungal isolates were isolated. aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 11 (27.5%), anaerobes alone in five (12.5%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in seven (17.5%). mycobacterium sp. were recovered in 11 (27.5%) and fungi in six (15%). the recovery of anaerobes was associated with dental infection. eighteen aerobic bacteria were isolated and the predominant ones were staphylococcus aureus (eight isolates) and group a streptococci (four). twenty-four anaerobic bacteria were recovered and the predominant ones were: prevotella sp. (six), peptostreptococcus sp. (five), propionibacterium acnes (four) and fusobacterium sp. (three). these findings demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material from the glands for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

(including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
