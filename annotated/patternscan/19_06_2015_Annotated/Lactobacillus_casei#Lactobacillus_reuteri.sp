TI  == biochemical analysis of respiratory metabolism in the heterofermentative lactobacillus spicheri and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == aims: this study evaluated the aerobic and respiratory metabolism in lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus spicheri, two heterofermentative species  used in sourdough fermentation. methods and results: in silico genome analysis, production of metabolites and gene expression of pyruvate oxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase were assessed in anaerobic and aerobic cultures of l. reuteri and l. spicheri. respiring homofermentative l. casei n87 and l. rhamnosus n132 were used for comparison. aerobiosis and respiration increased the biomass production of heterofermentative strains compared to anaerobic cultivation. respiration led to acetoin production by l. rhamnosus and  l. casei, but not in heterofermentative strains, in which lactate and acetate were the major end-products. l. spicheri lp38 showed the highest oxygen uptake. pyruvate oxidase, respiratory cytochromes, nadh-oxidase and nadh-peroxidase were  present in the genome of l. spicheri lp38. both l. spicheri lp38 and l. rhamnosus n132 overexpressed pox in aerobic cultures, while cyda was up-regulated only when heme was supplied; pdh was repressed during aerobic growth. conclusions: aerobic  and respiratory growth provided physiological and metabolic advantages also in heterofermentative lactobacilli. significance and impact of the study: the exploitation of oxygen-tolerant phenotypes of l. spicheri may be useful for the development of improved starter cultures. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == probiotic and technological properties of lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  == this work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. ten different strains were recognized by rep-pcr and pfge fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. these strains belonged to five species, lactobacillus gasseri (3), lactobacillus reuteri (2), lactobacillus vaginalis (2), lactobacillus fermentum (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). all ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to  epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate  fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. as expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low ph (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this ph. species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward h. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. none of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. two l. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used  as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-helicobacter and antioxidative activities. the two l. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.

TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == inhibitory activity in vitro of probiotic lactobacilli against oral candida under different fermentation conditions.
AB  == clinical studies have shown that probiotics positively affect oral health by decreasing gum bleeding and/or reducing salivary counts of certain oral pathogens. our aim was to investigate the inhibitory effect of six probiotic lactobacilli against opportunistic oral candida species. sugar utilisation by both lactobacilli and candida was also assessed. agar overlay assay was utilised  to study growth inhibition of candida albicans, candida glabrata and candida krusei by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus  reuteri sd2112, lactobacillus brevis cd2, lactobacillus bulgaricus lb86 and l. bulgaricus lb lact. the inhibitory effect was measured at ph 5.5, 6.4, and 7.2, respectively, and in the presence of five different carbohydrates in growth medium (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, and sorbitol). growth and final ph values were measured at two-hour time points to 24 h. l. rhamnosus gg showed the  strongest inhibitory activity in fructose and glucose medium against c. albicans, followed by l. casei shirota, l. reuteri sd2112 and l. brevis cd2. none of the lactobacilli tested affected the growth of c. krusei. only l. rhamnosus gg produced slight inhibitory effect on c. glabrata. the lower ph values led to larger inhibition zones. sugar fermentation profiles varied between the strains.  l. casei shirota grew in the presence of all sugars tested, whereas l. brevis cd2 could utilise only glucose and fructose. all candida species metabolised the available sugars but the most rapid growth was observed with c. glabrata. the results suggest that commercially available probiotics differ in their inhibitory activity and carbohydrate utilisation; the above properties are modified by different ph values and sugars with more pronounced inhibition at lower ph.

TI  == coexpression and secretion of endoglucanase and phytase genes in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == a multifunctional transgenic lactobacillus with probiotic characteristics and an  ability to degrade beta-glucan and phytic acid (phytate) was engineered to improve nutrient utilization, increase production performance and decrease digestive diseases in broiler chickens. the bacillus subtilis wl001 endoglucanase gene (celw) and aspergillus fumigatus wl002 phytase gene (phyw) mature peptide (phywm) were cloned into an expression vector with the lactate dehydrogenase promoter of lactobacillus casei and the secretion signal peptide of the lactococcus lactis usp45 gene. this construct was then transformed into lactobacillus reuteri xc1 that had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract  of broilers. heterologous enzyme production and feed effectiveness of this genetically modified l. reuteri strain were investigated and evaluated. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the molecular mass of phywm and celw was approximately 48.2 and 55 kda, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular weights. endoglucanase and phytase activities in the extracellular fraction of the transformed l. reuteri culture were 0.68 and 0.42 u/ml, respectively. transformed l. reuteri improved the feed conversion ratio of broilers from 21 to 42 days of age and over the whole feeding period. however, there was no effect on body weight gain and feed intake of chicks. transformed l. reuteri supplementation improved levels of ash, calcium and phosphorus in tibiae at day 21 and of phosphorus at day 42. in addition, populations of escherichia coli, veillonella spp. and bacteroides vulgatus were decreased, while populations of bifidobacterium genus and lactobacillus spp. were increased in the cecum at day 21.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == enrichment of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in hen eggs and broiler chickens meat by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to compare conjugated linoleic acid (cla) concentrations in chickens supplemented with 4 american tissue culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum, and 4 isolates of lactobacillus  reuteri from camel, cattle, sheep and goat rumen extracts. 2. micro-organisms were grown anaerobically in mrs broth, and 10(6) cfu/ml of bacteria were administered orally to mixed-sex, 1-d-old broiler chickens weekly for 4 weeks and to 23-week-old layer hens weekly for 6 weeks. 3. the 4 strains were evaluated for their effects on synthesis of cla in hen eggs and broiler meat cuts. 4. administration of pure lactobacillus and isolated l. reuteri strains from camel,  cattle, goat and sheep led to significantly increased cla concentrations of 0.2-1.2 mg/g of fat in eggs and 0.3-1.88 mg/g of fat in broiler chicken flesh homogenates of leg, thigh and breast. 5. these data demonstrate that lactic acid  bacteria of animal origin (l. reuteri) significantly enhanced cla synthesis in both eggs and broiler meat cuts.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == probiotics lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and lactobacillus casei crl 431 modestly increase growth, but not iron and zinc status, among indonesian children aged 1-6 years.
AB  == probiotics and milk calcium may increase resistance to intestinal infection, but  their effect on growth and iron and zinc status of indonesian children is uncertain. we investigated the hypotheses that cow milk with added probiotics would improve growth and iron and zinc status of indonesian children, whereas milk calcium alone would improve growth but reduce iron and zinc status. a 6-mo randomized trial was conducted in low-socioeconomic urban communities of jakarta. healthy children (n = 494) were randomly assigned to receive low-lactose milk with a low calcium content of approximately 50 mg/d (lc; n = 124), a regular calcium content of approximately 440 mg/d (rc group; n = 126), regular calcium with 5 x 10(8) cfu/d lactobacillus casei crl 431 (casei; n = 120), or regular calcium with 5 x 10(8) cfu/d lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 (reuteri; n = 124).  growth, anemia, and iron and zinc status were assessed before and after the intervention. compared with the rc group, the reuteri group had significantly greater weight gain [0.22 (95% ci: 0.02, 0.42) kg], weight-for-age z-score (waz)  changes [0.09 (95% ci: 0.01, 0.17)], and monthly weight [0.03 (95% ci: 0.002, 0.05) kg/mo] and height [0.03 (95% ci: 0.01, 0.05) cm/mo] velocities. casei significantly increased monthly weight velocity [0.03 (95% ci: 0.001, 0.05) kg/mo], but not height. however, the changes in underweight, stunting, anemia prevalence, and iron and zinc status were similar between groups. in conclusion,  l. reuteri dsm 17938 modestly improved growth by increasing weight gain, waz changes, and weight and height velocity, whereas l. casei crl 431 modestly improved weight velocity. independent from probiotics supplementation, regular milk calcium did not affect growth or iron and zinc status.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination  on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic  rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. accordingly, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. mixed probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus reuteri. the rats were fed for 8 wk with the given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. results showed that supplementation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the controls. the symbiotic treatment was more effective in lowering ldl-c, whereas mixed probiotics treatment more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and ldl-c than the phytosterol-containing treatment. the phytosterol-containing treatments induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine. in conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be reduced to  lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using combinations of lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in functional foods.

TI  == randomized trial of probiotics and calcium on diarrhea and respiratory tract infections in indonesian children.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of calcium and probiotics on the incidence  and duration of acute diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (artis) in  low-socioeconomic communities of jakarta, indonesia. methods: we conducted a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 494 healthy children aged 1 to 6 years who received low-lactose milk with low calcium content (lc; approximately 50 mg/day; n = 124), regular calcium content (rc; approximately 440 mg/day; n = 126), rc with 5.10(8) colony-forming units per day of lactobacillus casei crl431  (casei; n = 120), or rc with 5.10(8) colony-forming units per day of lactobacillus reuteri dsm17938 (reuteri; n = 124). number and duration of diarrhea and artis episodes were primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. results: incidence of world health organization-defined diarrhea (>/=3 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was not significantly different between rc and lc (relative risk [rr]: 0.99 [95% confidence interval (ci): 0.62-1.58]), between  casei and rc (rr: 1.21 [95% ci: 0.76-1.92]), or between reuteri and rc (rr: 0.76  [95% ci: 0.46-1.25]) groups. incidence of all reported diarrhea (>/=2 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was significantly lower in the reuteri versus rc group (rr: 0.68 [95% ci: 0.46-0.99]). irrespective of the definition used, reuteri significantly reduced diarrhea incidence in children with lower nutritional status (below-median height-and-weight-for-age z score). none of the  interventions affected artis. conclusions: rc milk, alone or with l casei, did not reduce diarrhea or artis in indonesian children. l reuteri may prevent diarrhea, especially in children with lower nutritional status.

TI  == biodiversity of antifungal lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw milk samples from cow, ewe and goat over one-year period.
AB  == antifungal lactic acid bacteria (alab) biodiversity was evaluated in raw milk from ewe, cow and goat over one year period. lactic acid bacteria were enumerated using 8 semi-selective media, and systematically screened for their antifungal activity against 4 spoilage fungi commonly encountered in dairy products. depending on the selective medium, between 0.05% (elliker agar) and 5.5% (lamvab  agar) screened colonies showed an antifungal activity. the great majority of these active colonies originated from cow (49%) and goat (43%) milks, whereas only 8% were isolated from ewe milk. penicillium expansum was the most frequently inhibited fungus with 48.5% of colonies active against p. expansum among the 1235 isolated, followed by mucor plumbeus with 30.6% of active colonies, kluyveromyces lactis with only 12.1% of active colonies and pichia anomala with 8.7% of active  colonies. in the tested conditions, 94% of the sequenced active colonies belonged to lactobacillus. among them, targeted fungal species differed according to the lactobacillus group, whose presence largely depended on year period and milk origin. the lb. casei and lb. reuteri groups, predominantly recovered in summer/fall, were overrepresented in the population targeting m. plumbeus, whereas isolates from the lb. plantarum group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting k. lactis, the ones belonging to the lb. buchneri group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting p. anomala. raw milk, especially cow and goat milks from the summer/fall period appeared to be a productive reservoir for antifungal  lactobacilli.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.

TI  == utilization of uf-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == four lactobacilli strains (lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacilus casei and lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in mrs broth and three lactococci strains (streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in m17 broth. l. reuteri and s. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 u/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. the maximum production of beta-galactosidase by l. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial ph 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g n/l and incubation temperature at 30 degrees c/24 hrs to give 6.31 u/ml. while in case of s. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (kh2po4:k2hpo4, g/l), at initial ph 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate  (0.66g n/l) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees c for 24 hrs to give 7.85 u/ml.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characterisation of ting, a sorghum-based sourdough  product from botswana.
AB  == ting is a fermented sorghum product of botswana which is used to prepare porridges of different consistencies. this study aimed to characterise ting with  respect to fermentation microbiota and metabolite composition, and to develop starter cultures for ting fermentation. the ph values of 10 ting samples from botswana ranged between 3.5 and 4.0 and cell counts ranged between 1.2x10(8) and  1.2x10(10)cfu/g lactic acid bacteria. yeast cell counts were below 10(5)cfu/g in  all samples and enterobacteriaceae were less than 10 cfu/g. the microbiota of samples consisted of 2-4 dominant strains and strains were identified based on the sequence of their 16s rrna genes as lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus harbinensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus coryniformis. binary strain combinations were employed as starter cultures to produce ting. major fermentation products were lactate, acetate and ethanol, additionally, 1,2 propanediol and 1,3 propanediol were produced by some strains. all strains were capable of producing ting, which was accompanied by a decrease in ph from 6.3 to  4 within 8h. traditionally processed ting requires 2 to 3 days to attain a ph below 4; the starter cultures thus reduced the fermentation time to 8h.

TI  == characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  == anti-lactobacillus johnsonii (lj) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with lj reacted with glyceroglycolipids in lj, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (dh-dg), trihexaosyl dg (th-dg) and tetrahexaosyl dg (teth-dg), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. structural analyses of glycolipids from lj revealed that dh-dg was galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, and th-dg and teth-dg were novel derivatives of it with alpha-gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and galalpha1-6galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, respectively. dh-dg was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but teth-dg was restricted to lj, l. intestinalis and l. reuteri, while the th-dgs from l. casei were glc1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and an esterified derivative of it, glc1-6galalpha1-2glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'dg, as reported in the literature. anti-lj antisera reacted with th-dg and esterified th-dg from l. casei to lesser  extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl dg from staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl dg from streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-gal residues. the major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. also, human igm antibodies against th-dg and teth-dg from  lj were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an  immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, th-dg and teth-dg.

TI  == ability of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus reuteri to protect against oxidative stress in rats fed aflatoxins-contaminated diet.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been reported to remove mycotoxins from aqueous solutions through a binding process, which appears to be species and strain specific. the aim of the current study was to evaluate the protective role of lactobacillus casei (l1) and lactobacillus reuteri (l2) against aflatoxin (afs)-induced oxidative stress in rats. sixty female sprague-dawley rats were divided into 6 groups including the control group and the groups treated with l1  or l2 (1 x 10(1)(1)/ml) alone at a dose of 10 ml/kg b.w or plus afs (3 mg/kg diet) for 4 weeks. at the end of the treatments, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical and histological studies. the results indicated that afs alone induced a significant decrease in food intake and body weight and a significant increase in transaminase, alkaline phosphatase cholesterol, triglycerides, total lipids, creatinine, uric acid and nitric oxide in serum and  lipid peroxidation in liver and kidney accompanied with a significant decrease in total antioxidant capacity. treatments with l1 or l2 succeeded to induce a significant improvement in all the biochemical parameters and histological picture of the liver. moreover, l2 was more effective than l1 and both can be used safely in functional foods.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == expression of lactobacillus reuteri pg4 collagen-binding protein gene in lactobacillus casei atcc 393 increases its adhesion ability to caco-2 cells.
AB  == the collagen-binding protein gene cnb was cloned from the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strain pg4. the dna sequence of the cnb gene (792 bp) has an open reading frame encoding 263 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 28.5 kda. the cnb gene was constructed so as to constitutively express under the control of the lactococcus lactis laca promoter and was transformed into lactobacillus casei atcc 393, a strain isolated from dairy products with poor ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. confocal immunofluorescence microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of the transformed strain lb. casei pnz-cnb indicated that cnb was displayed on its cell surface. lb. casei pnz-cnb not only showed a higher ability to adhere to caco-2 cells but also exhibited a higher competition ability against escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes adhesion to caco-2 cells than lb. casei atcc 393.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == intestinal lactobacilli and the dc-sign gene for their recognition by dendritic cells play a role in the aetiology of allergic manifestations.
AB  == diminished exposure to harmless micro-organisms, such as lactobacilli, has been suggested to play a role in the increased prevalence of allergic disorders in westernized communities. the development of allergies depends on both environmental factors and genetic variations, including polymorphisms in genes encoding pattern recognition receptors. the present study examines the effects of both colonization with specific lactobacillus species and genetic variations in dc-sign, a pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells that recognizes lactobacilli, on the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) and sensitization in infancy. within the koala birth cohort study, faecal samples of 681 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for five lactobacillus species: l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri. eleven haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the dc-sign gene were genotyped in these children. allergic outcomes were a clinical diagnosis of ad and sensitization (specific ige) at age 2 years. l. rhamnosus (31.5 %), l. paracasei  (31.3 %) and l. acidophilus (14.4 %) were frequently detected in the faecal samples of one-month-old infants, whereas l. casei (2.5 %) and l. reuteri (<1 %)  were rare. colonization with l. paracasei decreased the risk of ad significantly  (odds ratio 0.57, 95 % confidence interval 0.32-0.99), whereas effects of l. acidophilus were of borderline statistical significance (0.46, 0.20-1.04). two dc-sign polymorphisms, rs11465413 and rs8112555, were statistically significantly associated with atopic sensitization. the present study supports the 'old friends' hypothesis suggesting that certain health-beneficial micro-organisms protect us from developing allergies and that these protective effects are species-dependent. firm conclusions on the potential interaction between lactobacillus colonization and genetic variations in dc-sign in association with  the development of allergic disorders cannot be drawn, given the limited power of our study. therefore, incorporation of consecutive faecal sampling in newly started (birth) cohort studies would be a first requisite to further increase our understanding of host-microbial interactions in health and disease.

TI  == phenolic acids and flavonoids in nonfermented and fermented red sorghum (sorghum  bicolor (l.) moench).
AB  == this study aimed to identify phenolic acids and flavonoids in the red sorghum variety pan 3860 and to determine changes in their concentrations during fermentation with lactobacilli. sorghum sourdoughs fermented with two binary strain combinations, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri , were compared to chemically acidified controls. four glycerol esters were tentatively identified, caffeoylglycerol, dicaffeoylglycerol, coumaroyl-caffeoylglycerol, and coumaroyl-feruloylglycerol, that have previously not been detected in sorghum. chemical acidification resulted in hydrolysis of phenolic acid esters and flavonoid glucosides. during lactic fermentation, phenolic acids, phenolic acid esters, and flavonoid glucosides were metabolized. analysis of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and naringenin-glucoside contents in single-strain cultures of lactobacilli demonstrated that glucosidase, phenolic acid reductase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase activities contributed to polyphenol metabolism. this study demonstrates that microbial fermentation of sorghum affects the content of polyphenols and can influence the nutritional value and antimicrobial activity of sorghum.

TI  == intestinal lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == key role of teichoic acids on aflatoxin b binding by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: to assess the ability of five probiotic bacteria to bind aflatoxin b(1) and to determine the key role of teichoic acids in the binding mechanism. methods and results: the strains were incubated in aqueous solutions containing aflatoxin b(1) (afb(1)). the amount of free toxin was quantified by hplc. stability of the  bacteria-aflatoxin complex was evaluated by repeated washes with buffer. in order to understand the binding process, protoplasts, spheroplasts and cell wall components of two strains were analysed to assess their capacity to bind afb(1).  additionally, the role of teichoic acids in the afb(1) binding process was assessed. lactobacillus reuteri strain nrrl14171 and lactobacillus casei strain shirota were the most efficient strains for binding afb(1). the stability of the  afb(1)-bacteria complex appears to be related to the binding ability of a particular strain; afb(1) binding was also ph-dependent. our results suggest that teichoic acids could be responsible for this ability. conclusions: our results provide information concerning afb(1) binding by previously untested strains, leading to enhanced understanding of the mechanism by which probiotic bacteria bind afb(1). significance and impact of the study: our results support the suggestion that some probiotic bacteria could prevent absorption of aflatoxin from the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == selective probiotic bacteria induce il-10-producing regulatory t cells in vitro by modulating dendritic cell function through dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin.
AB  == background: lactobacilli are probiotic bacteria that are frequently tested in the management of allergic diseases or gastroenteritis. it is hypothesized that these probiotics have immunoregulatory properties and promote mucosal tolerance, which  is in part mediated by regulatory t cells (treg cells). on the basis of pathogenic or tissue-specific priming, dendritic cells (dc) acquire different t cell-instructive signals and drive the differentiation of naive t h cells into either t h 1, t h 2, or regulatory effector t cells. objective: we studied in what way different species of lactobacilli prime human dcs for their ability to drive treg cells. methods: human monocyte-derived dcs were cultured in vitro with lactobacilli of different species. results: two different species of lactobacilli, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei , but not lactobacillus plantarum, prime monocyte-derived dcs to drive the development of treg cells. these treg cells produced increased levels of il-10 and were capable  of inhibiting the proliferation of bystander t cells in an il-10-dependent fashion. strikingly, both l reuteri and l casei , but not l plantarum , bind the  c-type lectin dc-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (dc-sign). blocking antibodies to dc-sign inhibited the induction of the treg cells by these probiotic bacteria, stressing that ligation of dc-sign can actively prime dcs to induce treg cells. conclusions: the targeting of dc-sign by certain probiotic bacteria might explain their beneficial effect in the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis and crohn's disease.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri beta-galactosidase activity and low milk acidification ability.
AB  == beta-galactosidase activity was studied as a possible cause of the low milk acidification ability observed in lactobacillus reuteri nrrl 14171. enzymatic activity was determined in mrs broth supplemented with either glucose or lactose  and milk at the middle and final stage of the exponential phase, as well as at the stationary phase. results were compared with beta-galactosidase activity in lactobacillus casei nrrl-b1922, a strain that shows the milk acidification ability. the effects of the types of carbon and nitrogen sources were established by comparison of growth parameters (higher maximum cell concentration and specific growth rate) in broth culture and skim milk supplemented with 2% glucose or 1% casein peptone. in milk, l. reuteri showed higher beta-galactosidase activity in all growth phases compared with l. casei. greater cell concentration  maxima, specific growth rates, and acidification abilities were observed in l. reuteri when it was cultured in milk supplemented with 1% casein peptone compared with non-supplemented milk cultures. results suggest that the poor milk acidification ability observed in l. reuteri may be more related to a weak proteolytic system than to deficient beta-galactosidase activity.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria on humoral immunity to candida albicans in immunodeficient bg/bg-nu/nu and bg/bg-nu/+ mice.
AB  == germfree beige-nude ( bg/bg-nu/nu) and beige-heterozygous ( bg/bg-nu/+) mice were colonized with a pure culture of candida albicans or with a probiotic bacterium (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei, or bifidobacterium infantis). probiotic-colonized mice were subsequently challenged  orally with c. albicans. the effect of prior colonization with probiotic bacteria on the antibody responses of the immunodeficient mice to alimentary tract colonization with c. albicans was compared to the antibody responses of the gnotobiotic mice colonized only with c. albicans. this study demonstrated that, although the probiotic bacteria did not induce a vigorous antibody response to their own antigens, they altered the antibody responses of mice to c. albicans. in t cell competent bg/bg-nu/+mice, b. infantis enhanced and focused igg1, igg2a, and iga responses to c. albicans antigens. some of the probiotic bacteria also enhanced the igg1 and igg2a antibody responses of bg/bg-nu/nu mice to c. albicans antigens. this study not only shows the value of gnotobiotic animal models in demonstrating that probiotic bacteria can affect the capacity of mice to form antibodies to c. albicans, but it also points out their usefulness in comparing the capacity of different probiotic bacteria to produce beneficial health effects in mice.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == reduction of sulfide, ammonia compounds, and adhesion properties of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 to reduce sulfide, ammonia, and to adhere to bio-surfaces was characterized and compared with three lactobacillus reference strains. sulfide reduction by strain ke99 in mrs broth increased exponentially after 10-h growth and reached a maximum (>300 ppm reduction) within 48 h. ke99 demonstrated a maximum reduction of sulfide under anaerobic (341 ppm)  growth conditions at ph 6.0-8.0 range. maximum anaerobic reduction of sulfide was demonstrated by l. casei 393 at ph 7.0 (272 ppm); l. rhamnosus at ph 8.0 (277 ppm); and l. reuteri at ph 7.0 (244 ppm). ke99 reduced sulfide more (p < 0.0001)  in mrs broth spiked with na2s (374 ppm) than (nh4)2s (340 ppm) salts. ammonia reduction by strain ke99 and the three lactobacillus reference strains in mrs broth was low. ammonia reduction reached a maximum within 36 h and remained unchanged over extended incubations of 48 h to 72 h or further. ke99 reduced ammonium sulfate (37 ppm) more readily than the nitrate (31 ppm), hypophosphate (29 ppm), or chloride (20 ppm) salts of ammonia. ke99 and the three reference strains of lactobacilli demonstrated avid binding to bio-coat (cn type-i, cn type-iv, laminin, fibronectin), matrigel, and caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro. the number of lactobacilli binding to caco-2 was estimated at 74/cell with strain ke99, which was significantly higher compared with 40/cell (p < 0.0001), 26/cell  (0.0001), and 64/cell (p < 0.002) with l. casei 393, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus, respectively. the interaction of ke99 to immobilized cn type-i was saturable and reached an equilibrium within 1 h at room temperature. ke99 binding to cn type-i occurred at a wide ph range and was biphasic with maximum binding at ph 5.5 and 7.5. inhibition and binding-displacement experiments with different salts and sugars suggested that the ke99 binding to immobilized cn type-i may involve a combination of electrostatic and lectin-type interactions. ke99 effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in the range of 55% (atcc43895) to 76% (atcc43894). the binding-displacement values for l. casei 393, l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus to detach cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 (atcc43894) were 66 +/- 4%, 59 +/- 2%, and 64 +/- 2%, respectively. also, a reconstituted solution of the freeze-dried ke99 preparation effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in a dose-dependent manner that reached a binding-displacement equilibrium of 85% at a 1% wt/vol ke99 concentration.

TI  == lactobacilli differentially modulate expression of cytokines and maturation surface markers in murine dendritic cells.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) play a pivotal immunoregulatory role in the th1, th2, and th3 cell balance and are present throughout the gastrointestinal tract. thus, dc  may be targets for modulation by gut microbes, including ingested probiotics. in  the present study, we tested the hypothesis that species of lactobacillus, important members of the gut flora, differentially activate dc. bone marrow-derived murine dc were exposed to various lethally irradiated lactobacillus spp. and resultant culture supernatants were analyzed for il-6, il-10, il-12, and tnf-alpha. substantial differences were found among strains in  the capacity to induce il-12 and tnf-alpha production in the dc. similar but less pronounced differences were observed among lactobacilli in the induction of il-6  and il-10. although all strains up-regulated surface mhc class ii and b7-2 (cd86), which is indicative of dc maturation, those lactobacilli with greatest capacity to induce il-12 were most effective. remarkably, lactobacillus reuteri dsm12246, a poor il-12 inducer, inhibited il-12, il-6, and tnf-alpha induction by the otherwise strong cytokine inducer l. casei chcc3139, while il-10 production remained unaltered. in analogous fashion, l. reuteri reduced l. casei-induced up-regulation of b7-2. these results suggest that different species of lactobacillus exert very different dc activation patterns and, furthermore, at least one species may be capable of inhibiting activities of other species in the genus. thus, the potential exists for th1/th2/th3-driving capacities of the gut dc to be modulated according to composition of gut microflora, including ingested probiotics.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == rapid pcr-based procedure to identify lactic acid bacteria: application to six common lactobacillus species.

TI  == strain-dependent induction of cytokine profiles in the gut by orally administered lactobacillus strains.
AB  == different lactobacillus strains are frequently used in consumer food products. in addition, recombinant lactobacilli which contain novel expression vectors can now be used in immunotherapeutic applications such as oral vaccination strategies and in t cell tolerance induction approaches for autoimmune disease. both for food and clinical applications of lactobacilli, proper selection of wild type strains  is crucial. for that purpose, eight different common lactobacillus strains were analysed with respect to mucosal induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, iga-producing plasma cells in the gut, as well as systemic antibody responses against a parenterally administered antigen. immunohistochemical analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the gut villi showed no significant induction of the cytokines il-1alpha, ifn-gamma, il-4 or il-10 after oral administration of wild type lactobacillus strains. in contrast, oral administration of l. reuteri and l. brevis induced expression of the proinflammatory/th1 cytokines tnf-alpha, il-2 and/or il-1beta. oral administration of these two strains and l. fermentum also significantly enhanced  the igg response against parenterally administered haptenated chicken gamma globulin (tnp-cgg). the five other strains did not show this adjuvanticity. l. reuteri induced relatively high levels of igg2a compared to l. murines, a nonadjuving lactobacillus strain. these findings imply that different lactobacillus strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles and possess differential intrinsic adjuvanticity. this suggests that rational lactobacillus strain selection provides a strategy to influence cytokine expression and thereby influence immune responses.

AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == screening of probiotic activities of forty-seven strains of lactobacillus spp. by in vitro techniques and evaluation of the colonization ability of five selected strains in humans.
AB  == the probiotic potential of 47 selected strains of lactobacillus spp. was investigated. the strains were examined for resistance to ph 2.5 and 0.3% oxgall, adhesion to caco-2 cells, and antimicrobial activities against enteric pathogenic bacteria in model systems. from the results obtained in vitro, five strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, l. rhamnosus lgg, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis chcc 2329, and l. casei subsp. alactus chcc 3137, were  selected for in vivo studies. the daily consumption by 12 healthy volunteers of two doses of 10(10) freeze-dried bacteria of the selected strains for 18 days was followed by a washout period of 17 days. fecal samples were taken at days 0 and 18 and during the washout period at days 5 and 11. lactobacillus isolates were initially identified by api 50chl and internal transcribed spacer pcr, and their  identities were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis in combination with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. among the tested strains, l. rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, and l. rhamnosus lgg were identified most frequently in fecal samples; they were found in 10, 8, and 7 of the 12 samples tested during the intervention period, respectively, whereas reisolations were less frequent in the washout period. the bacteria were reisolated in concentrations from 10(5) to  10(8) cells/g of feces. survival and reisolation of the bacteria in vivo appeared to be linked to ph tolerance, adhesion, and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == in vitro studies of porcine lactobacilli for possible probiotic use.
AB  == fourteen strains of lactobacilli isolated from the gut of suckling pigs were identified and studied to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobial feed additives, acid tolerance, adherence to epithelial cells from the porcine intestine and antimicrobial activity. four strains were identified as lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, two strains as lactobacillus rhamnosus as well  as lactobacillus reuteri and three strains as lactobacillus salivarius. the remaining strains could not be identified. antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed susceptibility of the lactobacilli to many of the antimicrobial feed additives commonly used in pigs. strains resistant to cyadox and nourseothricin occurred in high numbers. the tested lactobacilli were acid-resistant at ph 3. thirteen strains of lactobacilli exhibited strong adherence to epithelial cells from the porcine intestine while one strain was classed as weakly-adherent. all lactobacilli showed inhibitory activity against indicator bacteria in the presence of glucose. lactate and acetate were the principal final products of glucose fermentation in all strains. only three strains produced h2o2 in detectable amounts.

TI  == biotherapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria on candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  == four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect  athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. each bacterial species and candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. the presence of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, or bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with c. albicans alone. the incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. the numbers of c. albicans present in the alimentary tracts of euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice were significantly reduced by l. casei gg and b. animalis. none of the probiotic bacteria species completely prevented mucosal candidiasis, but b. animalis reduced its incidence and severity. probiotic bacteria also modulated antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses to c. albicans. the prolonged survival of mice, decreased severity of mucosal and systemic candidiasis, modulation of immune responses, decreased number of c. albicans in the alimentary tract, and reduced numbers of orogastric infections demonstrated not only that probiotic bacteria have biotherapeutic potential for prophylaxis against and therapy of this fungal disease but also that probiotic bacteria protect mice from candidiasis by a variety of immunologic (thymic and extrathymic) and nonimmunologic mechanisms in this model.

TI  == colonization of congenitally immunodeficient mice with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == we assessed the capacity of four probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, and bifidobacterium animalis) to colonize, infect, stimulate immune responses in, and affect the growth and survival of congenitally immunodeficient gnotobiotic beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu)  and beige-euthymic (bg/bg-nu/+) mice. the bacteria colonized and persisted, in pure culture, in the alimentary tracts of both mouse strains for the entire study period (12 weeks). although all adult and neonatal beige-euthymic mice survived probiotic colonization, some infant mortality occurred in beige-athymic pups born to mothers colonized with pure cultures of l. reuteri or l. casei gg. the probiotic bacteria manifested different capacities to adhere to epithelial surfaces, disseminate to internal organs, affect the body weight of adult mice and the growth of neonatal mice, and stimulate immune responses. although the probiotic species were innocuous for adults, these results suggest that caution and further studies to assess the safety of probiotic bacteria for immunodeficient hosts, especially neonates, are required.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  == cloning of promoter-like sequences from lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei  cg11 and their expression in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == fragments of chromosomal dna from lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei cg11 (formerly lactobacillus casei cg11) capable of functioning as promoters were isolated using the broad host range, promoter-probe vector pgkv210. five such fragments designated p61, p79, p80, p116, and p144 were completely sequenced and  analyzed. fragment p61 had the highest transcriptional efficiency in escherichia  coli and lactobacillus reuteri whereas p80 was the most active in lactococcus lactis. in general, the orders of the transcriptional strengths were almost identical in e. coli and lactobacillus reuteri but different from that in lactococcus lactis. mapping of the 5' end of cat mrna showed that different regions of fragments p79 and p144 were used as promoters in lactococcus lactis than in e. coli and lactobacillus reuteri. analysis of these dna sequences revealed that the putative -35 and -10 hexanucleotides resembled those of e. coli, bacillus subtilis, and lactococci. the spacing between these two hexanucleotides and between the putative -10 hexanucleotide and the transcriptional start point (a residues predominated) ranged from 17 to 18 base pairs and from 5 to 7 base pairs, respectively. each of the cloned lactobacillus  paracasei cg11 promoter-like fragments contained an at-rich sequence upstream of  the putative -35 region (from 60 to 73%).

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
