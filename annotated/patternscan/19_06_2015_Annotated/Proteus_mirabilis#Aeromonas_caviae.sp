TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == isolation, identification and application of novel bacterial consortium tj-1 for  the decolourization of structurally different azo dyes.
AB  == a novel bacterial consortium (tj-1), which could decolorize acid orange 7 (ao7) and manyother azo dyes, was developed. in tj-1 three bacterial strains were identified as aeromonas caviae, proteus mirabilis and rhodococcus globerulus by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. ao7 decolorization was significantly higher with the use of consortium as compared to the use of individual strains, indicating complementary interactions among these strains. ao7 decolorization was observed under microaerophilic condition in the presence of organic carbon source. either  yeast extract (ye) alone or a combination of ye and glucose resulted in much higher decolorization of ao7 as compared to glucose alone, peptone or starch. kinetic studies with different initial ao7 concentrations showed that more than 90% decolorization could be achieved even at 200mg/l within 16h. fed-batch studies showed that ao7 decolorization required 10h during the first cycle and 5h in the second and third cycles, showing that bacterial cells could be used for multiple cycles. the consortium also decolorized fifteen other azo dyes individually as well as a simulated wastewater containing a mixture of all the sixteen azo dyes, thus, conferring the possibility of application of tj-1 for the treatment of industrial wastewaters.
