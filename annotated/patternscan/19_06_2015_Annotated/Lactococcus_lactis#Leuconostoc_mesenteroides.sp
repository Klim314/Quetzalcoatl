TI  == lactic acid microflora of the gut of snail .
AB  == the intestinal lactic acid microflora of the edible snail cornu aspersum was studied by culture-based methods and was phenotypically and molecularly characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates  was investigated. snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of bulgaria. one hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of lab, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. the snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by enterococcus (17 isolates), lactococcus (12 isolates), leuconostoc (7 isolates), lactobacillus (18 isolates)  and weissella (1 isolate). the species affiliation of lactococcus lactis (12), leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. the lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence  analysis of 16s rdna as lactobacillus brevis (12), l. plantarum (2), lactobacillus graminis (1) and lactobacillus curvatus (3). the species l. brevis, l. graminis and l. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas l. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of l. mesentereoides p4/8 against propionibacterium acnes. the present study showed that the lab are a component of the microbial communities in the snail digestive  system. this is the first report on lactobacillus strains detected in the gut of  c. aspersum.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == probiotic potential of selected lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from brazilian kefir grains.
AB  == a total of 34 lactic acid bacteria isolates from 4 different brazilian kefir grains were identified and characterized among a group of 150 isolates, using the ability to tolerate acidic ph and resistance to bile salts as restrictive criteria for probiotic potential. all isolates were identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and 16s rdna sequencing of representative amplicons. eighteen isolates belonged to the species leuconostoc mesenteroides, 11 to lactococcus lactis (of which 8 belonged to subspecies cremoris and 3 to subspecies lactis), and 5 to lactobacillus paracasei. to exclude replicates, a molecular typing analysis was performed by combining repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr and random amplification of polymorphic dna techniques. considering a threshold of 90% similarity, 32 different strains were considered.  all strains showed some antagonistic activity against 4 model food pathogens. in  addition, 3 lc. lactis strains and 1 lb. paracasei produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against at least 2 indicator organisms. moreover, 1 lc. lactis and 2 lb. paracasei presented good total antioxidative activity. none of these strains showed undesirable enzymatic or hemolytic activities, while proving susceptible or intrinsically resistant to a series of clinically relevant antibiotics. the lb. paracasei strain mrs59 showed a level of adhesion to human caco-2 epithelial cells comparable with that observed for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. taken together, these properties allow the mrs59 strain to be considered a promising probiotic candidate.

TI  == short communication: evaluation of the microbiota of kefir samples using metagenetic analysis targeting the 16s and 26s ribosomal dna fragments.
AB  == milk kefir is produced by fermenting milk in the presence of kefir grains. this beverage has several benefits for human health. the aim of this experiment was to analyze 5 kefir grains (and their products) using a targeted metagenetic approach. of the 5 kefir grains analyzed, 1 was purchased in a supermarket, 2 were provided by the ministry of agriculture (namur, belgium), and 2 were provided by individuals. the metagenetic approach targeted the v1-v3 fragment of  the 16s ribosomal (r)dna for the grains and the resulting beverages at 2 levels of grain incorporation (5 and 10%) to identify the bacterial species population.  in contrast, the 26s rdna pyrosequencing was performed only on kefir grains with  the aim of assessing the yeast populations. in parallel, ph measurements were performed on the kefir obtained from the kefir grains using 2 incorporation rates. regarding the bacterial population, 16s pyrosequencing revealed the presence of 20 main bacterial species, with a dominance of the following: lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, gluconobacter frateurii, lactobacillus kefiri, acetobacter orientalis, and acetobacter lovaniensis. an important difference was noticed between the kefir samples: kefir grain purchased from a supermarket (sample e) harbored a much higher proportion of several operational taxonomic units of lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides. this sample of grain was macroscopically different from the others in terms of size, apparent cohesion of the grains, structure, and texture, probably associated with a lower level of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. the kefir (at an incorporation rate of 5%) produced from this sample of grain was characterized by a lower ph value (4.5) than the others. the other 4 samples of kefir (5%) had ph values above 5. comparing the kefir grain and the kefir, an increase in the population of gluconobacter in grain sample b was observed. this  was also the case for acetobacter orientalis in sample d. in relation to 26s pyrosequencing, our study revealed the presence of 3 main yeast species: naumovozyma spp., kluyveromyces marxianus, and kazachastania khefir. for naumovozyma, further studies are needed to assess the isolation of new species. in conclusion, this study has proved that it is possible to establish the patterns of bacterial and yeast composition of kefir and kefir grain. this was only achieved with the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == effect of dissolved oxygen on redox potential and milk acidification by lactic acid bacteria isolated from a dl-starter culture.
AB  == milk acidification by dl-starter cultures [cultures containing lactococcus lactis diacetylactis (d) and leuconostoc (l) species] depends on the oxidation-reduction (redox) potential in milk; however, the mechanisms behind this effect are not completely clear. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dissolved oxygen on acidification kinetics and redox potential during milk fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (lab). fermentations were conducted by single strains isolated from mixed dl-starter culture, including lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris, by the dl-starter culture, and by the type strains.  high and low levels of oxygen were produced by flushing milk with oxygen or nitrogen, respectively. the kinetics of milk acidification was characterized by the maximum rate and time of acidification (vamax and tamax), the maximum rate and time of reduction (vrmax and trmax), the minimum redox potential (eh7 final), and time of reaching eh7 final (trfinal). variations in kinetic parameters were observed at both the species and strain levels. two of the lc. lactis ssp. lactis strains were not able to lower redox potential to negative values. kinetic parameters of the dl-starter culture were comparable with the best acidifying and reducing strains, indicating their additive effects. acidification curves were mostly diauxic at all oxygen levels, displaying 2 maxima of acidification rate: before (aerobic maximum) and after (anaerobic maximum) oxygen depletion. the redox potential decreased concurrently with oxygen consumption and continued to decrease at slower rate until reaching the final values, indicating involvement of both oxygen and microbiological activity in the redox state of milk. oxygen flushing had a negative effect on reduction and acidification capacity of tested  lab. reduction was significantly delayed at high initial oxygen, exhibiting longer trmax, trfinal, or both. concurrently, anaerobic acidification rate maximum vamax was decreased and tamax was extended. fermentation kinetics in nitrogen-flushed milk was not statistically different from that in untreated milk except for lc. lactis ssp. lactis chcc d2, which showed faster reduction time after nitrogen flushing. this study clarifies the relationship between the redox  state in milk and acidification kinetics of the predominant subspecies in dl-starter cultures. this knowledge is important for dairies to ensure optimized, fast, and controlled milk fermentations, leading to greater standardization of dairy products.

TI  == pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from northwestern argentina.
AB  == the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from northwestern argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at maimara (chicha m) and tumbaya (chicha t). whereas by culture-dependent approach  a few number of species (lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens in chicha m, and enterococcus faecium and leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha t) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. the relative abundance of otus was higher in chicha  m than in chicha t; six lab genera were common for chicha m and t: enterococcus,  lactococcus, streptococcus, weissella, leuconostoc and lactobacillus while pediococcus only was detected in chicha m. among the 46 identified lab species, those of lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas enterococcus and leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha t and m, respectively. identification at species level showed the predominance of lb. plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, leuconostoc lactis and w. viridescens in chicha m while enterococcus hirae, e. faecium, lc. mesenteroides and weissella confusa predominated in chicha t samples. in parallel, when presumptive lab isolates (chicha m: 146; chicha t: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by isr-pcr and rapd-pcr profiles, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the leuconostoc genus (lc. mesenteroides and lc. lactis) in chicha m, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus being also present. in contrast, chicha t exhibited the presence of enterococcus and leuconostoc, e. faecium being the most representative species. massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. although differences in the lab species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant lab species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. the fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on lab population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.

TI  == the influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the function of cell-free solutions (cfss) of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (fbps) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) using hplc. cell free solutions were prepared from four lab strains. two different concentrations  which were 50% (5 ml cfs+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml cfs+7.5 ml medium/1:3)  cfs and the control without cfs were prepared. both concentration of cfs of streptococcus thermophilus and 50% cfs of pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by salmonella paratyphi a. tyramine production by escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% cfs of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% cfs of leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. the inhibitor effect of 50% cfs of p. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by listeria monocytogenes, following lc. lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% cfs of leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). the stimulation effects of 50% cfs of s. thermophilus and lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. cfs of lab strains showed  statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased ph quickly and reduced the formation of amn and bas. consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use cfs for food and food products.

TI  == phosphoketolases from lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pseudomonas aeruginosa: dissimilar sequences, similar substrates but distinct enzymatic characteristics.
AB  == phosphoketolases (pks) are large thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp)-dependent enzymes playing key roles in a number of essential pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. the putative pk genes of lactococcus lactis (ll) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (lm) were cloned in a prokaryotic vector, and the encoded proteins were expressed and purified yielding high purity proteins termed pk-ll and pk-lm, respectively.  similarly, the pk gene of pseudomonas aeruginosa was expressed, and the corresponding protein (pk-pa) was purified to homogeneity. the amino acid sequences predicted on the basis of genes' nucleotide sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometry and display low relative similarities. circular dichroism (cd)  spectra of these proteins predict higher alpha-helix than beta-strand contents. in addition, it is predicted that pk-ll contains tightly packed domains. enzymatic analysis showed that all three recombinant proteins, despite their dissimilar amino acid sequences, are active pks and accept both xylulose 5-phosphate (x5p) and fructose 6-phosphate (f6p) as substrates. however, they display substantially higher preference for x5p than for f6p. kinetic measurements indicated that pk-pa has the lowest km values for x5p and f6p suggesting the highest capacity for substrate binding. pk-ll has the largest kcat values for both substrates. nevertheless, in terms of substrate specificity constant, pk-pa has been found to be the most active pk against x5p. structural models for all three analysed pks predict similar folds in spite of amino acid sequence dissimilarities and contribute to understanding the enzymatic peculiarities of pk-pa compared to pk-ll and pk-lm.

TI  == in vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of vastedda-like cheese.
AB  == twelve lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously selected in vitro (gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for  the continuous four-season production of vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. the strains belonged to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and streptococcus thermophilus. lab were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth  of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (wbm) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in wbm and raw milk. the strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a ph drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. after 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in ph values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only lc. lactis subsp. cremoris pon153, ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides pon259 and  pon559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees c. a sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (pdo) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (vocs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (spme) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (gc/ms). the dominance of lactococci over thermophilic lab of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of voc profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of vastedda-like cheese.

TI  == microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  == the study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of st-nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. on the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named tr15 (truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: tr15-sc (58  isolates from tr15 collection), tr15-m (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and tr15-bhi (pools of isolates from bhi medium). their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk  were compared with the activity of complex consortium tr15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii). the natural consortium tr15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium tr15-bhi. the dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16s rdna sequencing and direct 16s rdna single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. the combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium tr15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics  than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such  as carnobacterium maltaromaticum, vagococcus fluvialis, enterococcus gilvus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas psychrophila and enterobacter spp.). the highest l. monocytogenes count was on rind with tr15-m and was positively associated with the highest ph value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by staphylococcus vitulinus, brevibacterium linens, microbacterium gubbeenense and brachybacterium tyrofermentans. the results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. it is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of serbia and lowland regions of croatia.
AB  == the goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (bg) and nine fresh soft (zg) artisanal cheeses collected in serbia and croatia. while lab were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all bg cheeses but  only in three zg cheese samples. high lab and yeast species diversity was determined (average h'(l)=0.4 and h'(y)=0.8, respectively). the predominant lab species in white pickled (bg) cheeses were lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (zg) cheeses the most dominant lab species were l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides. among the 20 yeast species found, debaryomyces hansenii, candida zeylanoides, and torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in  bg cheeses, while yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in zg cheeses. the characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of lab isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of lab strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic  or proteolytic activity. in conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of lab and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. the knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific lab and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.

TI  == multifactorial diversity sustains microbial community stability.
AB  == maintenance of a high degree of biodiversity in homogeneous environments is poorly understood. a complex cheese starter culture with a long history of use was characterized as a model system to study simple microbial communities. eight  distinct genetic lineages were identified, encompassing two species: lactococcus  lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the genetic lineages were found to be collections of strains with variable plasmid content and phage sensitivities. kill-the-winner hypothesis explaining the suppression of the fittest strains by density-dependent phage predation was operational at the strain level. this prevents the eradication of entire genetic lineages from the community during propagation regimes (back-slopping), stabilizing the genetic heterogeneity in the starter culture against environmental uncertainty.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of brazilian kefir during fermentation and storage processes.
AB  == the microbial community composition and chemical characteristics of a brazilian milk kefir sample produced during its manufacturing and refrigerated storage were investigated by culture-dependent and -independent methods and hplc. lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, acetobacter lovaniensis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated, whereas the detected bands on denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis corresponded to lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus parakefiri, and s. cerevisiae. after fermentation, lactic acid bacteria were present at levels of 10 log units, whereas acetic acid bacteria and yeast were present at levels of 7.8 and 6 log units, respectively. the lactic acid bacteria and yeast counts remained constant, whereas acetic acid bacteria counts decreased to 7.2 log units during storage. from fermentation to final storage, the ph, lactose content and citric acid of the kefir beverage decreased, followed by an increase in the concentrations of glucose, galactose, ethanol, and lactic, acetic, butyric, and propionic acids. these microbiological and chemical characteristics contribute to the unique taste and aroma of kefir. this research may serve as a basis for the future industrial production of this beverage in brazil.

TI  == comparative analysis of production and purification of homo- and hetero-polysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce homopolysaccharides (hops) and heteropolysaccharides (heps) with potential functional properties. in this work,  we have performed a comparative analysis of production and purification trials of these biopolymers from bacterial culture supernatants. lab strains belonging to four different genera, both natural as well as recombinant, were used as model systems for the production of hops and heps. two well characterized strains carrying the gft gene were used for beta-glucan production, pediococcus parvulus  2.6 (p. parvulus 2.6) isolated from cider, and the recombinant strain lactococcus lactis nz9000[pgtf] (l. lactis nz9000[pgtf]). in addition, another cider isolate, lactobacillus suebicus cupv225 (l. suebicus cupv225), and leuconostoc mesenteroides rtf10 (l. mesenteroides rtf10), isolated from meat products were included in the study. chemical analysis of the eps revealed that l. mesenteroides produces a dextran, l. suebicus a complex heteropolysaccharide, and the beta-glucan producing-strains the expected 2-substituted (1,3)-beta-glucan.

TI  == use of a novel escherichia coli-leuconostoc shuttle vector for metabolic engineering of leuconostoc citreum to overproduce d-lactate.
AB  == determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of a cryptic plasmid, pmblt00,  from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides kctc13302 revealed that it contains 20,721 bp, a g+c content of 38.7%, and 18 open reading frames. comparative sequence and mung been nuclease analyses of pmblt00 showed that pmblt00 replicates via the theta replication mechanism. a new, stable escherichia coli-leuconostoc shuttle vector, pmblt02, which was constructed from a theta-replicating pmblt00 replicon and an erythromycin resistance gene of pe194,  was successfully introduced into leuconostoc, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus. this shuttle vector was used to engineer leuconostoc citreum 95 to overproduce d-lactate. the l. citreum 95 strain engineered using plasmid pmblt02, which overexpresses d-lactate dehydrogenase, exhibited enhanced production of optically pure d-lactate (61 g/liter, which is 6 times greater than the amount produced by the control strain) when cultured in a reactor supplemented with 140  g/liter glucose. therefore, the shuttle vector pmblt02 can serve as a useful and  stable plasmid vector for further development of a d-lactate overproduction system in other leuconostoc strains and lactococcus lactis.

AB  == leuconostoc carnosum 4010 is a protective culture for meat products. it kills the foodborne pathogen listeria monocytogenes by producing two class iia (pediocin-like) bacteriocins, leucocin a and leucocin c. the genes for leucocin a production have previously been characterised from leuconostoc gelidum ual 187, whereas no genetic studies about leucocin c has been published. here, we characterised the genes for the production of leucocins a and c in l. carnosum 4010. in this strain, leucocin a and leucocin c operons were localised in different plasmids. unlike in l. gelidum, leucocin a operon in l. carnosum 4010 only contained the structural and the immunity genes lcaab without transporter genes lcaecd. on the contrary, leucocin c cluster included two intact operons. novel genes lecci encode the leucocin c precursor and the 97-aa immunity protein  leci, respectively. leci shares 48 % homology with the immunity proteins of sakacin p and listeriocin. another leucocin c operon lecxts, encoding an abc transporter and an accessory protein, was 97 % identical with the leucocin a transporter operon lcaecd of l. gelidum. for heterologous expression of leucocin  c in lactococcus lactis, the mature part of the lecc gene was fused with the signal sequence of usp45 in the secretion vector pleb690. l. lactis secreted leucocin c efficiently, as shown by large halos on lawns of l. monocytogenes and  leuconostoc mesenteroides indicators. the function of leci was then demonstrated  by expressing the gene leci in l. monocytogenes. leci-producing listeria was less sensitive to leucocin c than the vector strain, thus corroborating the immunity function of leci.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == effects of cow's and goat's milk as fermentation media on the microbial ecology of sugary kefir grains.
AB  == in the present study, we have investigated the importance of fermentation media on grain formation and the microbial characteristics of sugary kefir. the sugary  kefir grains were fermented in brown sugar, cow's milk or goat's milk. using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, we identified the microorganisms present in both the grains and filtrate and then evaluated their distribution. the structure of the grains was also observed by scanning electronic microscopy (sem). the identification results indicated that there were remarkable changes in microbial ecological profiles of the sugary kefir grains and their filtrates when brown sugar and milk were compared as fermentation media. three lactic acid bacteria (lab) species (leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus mali and lactobacillus hordei) were found in the grains fermented using brown sugar. however, four species, named leu. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, bifidobacterium psychraerophilum and enterococcus faecalis, were identified in the grains fermented using either cow's or goat's milk. the size and structure of the kefir grains were also significantly influenced by the culture medium. we hypothesize that the grains originally may contain many different microorganisms and the identified changes are an adaption to each specific medium during grain formation and growth. the distribution of strains thus may vary depending on the carbon and energy sources available for grain fermentation and these microbial changes will further affect the granulation and  growth of the grains. this study is important to our understanding of the mechanism of kefir grain formation and growth because it explores the relationship between fermentation media and kefir microorganisms.

TI  == determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. in the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region. among these species, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while lactococcus  lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. in the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16s rdna full-length sequencing. according to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were l. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. only 3 species, which are  l. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. this study  showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. practical application: due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. for this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions  of turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular  methods.

AB  == the present work was aimed at characterizing 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to obtain improved potential starter or probiotic cultures that could be used for making dairy products from ewe's milk and cow's milk. eight strains with antimicrobial properties, isolated from ewe's milk and from cheese made from ewe's and/or cow's milk, were studied. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis (five strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (one strain of each species). additionally, four strains were obtained from the american type culture collection: lactobacillus casei 393 (isolated from cheese), l. lactis subsp. lactis 11454 (origin nonspecified and a producer of nisin), and two strains isolated from human feces (l. paracasei subsp. paracasei 27092 and lactobacillus  rhamnosus 53103, antibacterial agent producer). all e. faecalis strains showed at least one virulence factor (either hemolysin or gelatinase), which emphasizes the importance of these studies in this species. both l. lactis strains and most lactobacillus spp. were good acidifiers in ewe's milk and cow's milk at 30 degrees c. high beta-galactosidase activity, as well as aminopeptidase activities that favor the development of desirable flavors in cheese, were detected in all lactobacillus spp. strains. furthermore, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 showed alpha-fucosidase activity (thought to help colonization of the intestine) and lack of alpha-glucosidase activity (a trait considered positive for diabetic and  obese humans). this last enzymatic activity was also lacking in l. lactis atcc 11454. l. mesenteroides was the only strain d(2)-lactic acid producer. the selection of any particular strain for probiotic or dairy cultures should be performed according to the technological and/or functional abilities needed.

AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the control of lactococcosis as well as to assess the impact of probiotics on the expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney and intestine of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides, were administered orally at 10(6) cfu g(-)(1) feed to fish for 36 days. twenty-one days after the start of the feeding period, fish were challenged with lactococcus garvieae. only the fish fed the diet containing lb. plantarum showed significantly (p < 0.05) improved protection against l. garvieae compared to the control. subsequently, real-time pcr was employed to determine the mrna levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-10 and tnf-alpha in the head kidney, and il-8, tlr5 and igt in the intestine of the control and lb. plantarum groups. il-1beta, il-10 and tnf-alpha gene expression were significantly up-regulated by lb. plantarum. moreover, the mrna levels of il-10, il-8 and igt were significantly higher in the lb. plantarum group after l. garvieae infection, suggesting that lb. plantarum can stimulate the immune response of rainbow trout. pcr-dgge revealed no detectable levels of the probiotics or the pathogen present on the distal intestinal mucosa. these findings demonstrate that direct probiotic-host interactions with the intestine are not always necessary to induce host stimulatory responses which ultimately enhance disease resistance. furthermore, as l. garvieae did not colonise the intestinal tract, and therefore likely did not infect via this route, the antagonistic properties of the probiotic candidate towards l. garvieae were likely of little influence in mediating the improved disease resistance which could be attributed to the elevated immunological response.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal italian goat cheese.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in valsesia (piemonte, italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. these cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter  bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic dna plus pcr analysis. bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log cfu ml(-1). their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. the growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus garviae, and enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of enterococcus (e. faecium, e. durans, e. gilvus, and e. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. occasionally, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == microbiota analysis of caspian sea yogurt, a ropy fermented milk circulated in japan.
AB  == we analyzed the microbiota of domestic ropy fermented milk, caspian sea yogurt (or 'kasupikai yohguruto' in japanese), circulated in japan. we collected six varieties from five localities. lactococcus (l) lactis ssp. cremoris was isolated from all samples as the dominant strain at levels of 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g. we show this strain produces an extracellular polysaccharide (eps) that causes the unique characteristic viscosity of the product. from analysis of the rapd pattern of 60  bacterial isolates from the six samples, we found that 59 strains from a total of 60 isolates were identical and produced this viscosity. furthermore, pfge analysis of representative strains from each sample indicated that the isolates could be classified into four subgroups. this suggests these l. lactis ssp. cremoris strains found in caspian sea yogurt may have been slightly mutated during subculture in japan. in addition, lactobacillus (l.) sakei ssp. sakei were isolated from three samples; l. plantarum, gluconoacetobacter sacchari and acetobacter aceti were isolated from two samples; and l. paracasei, l. kefiri, leuconostoc (leu.) mesenteroides were isolated from one sample.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == effects of temperature and ph on the growth of bacteria isolated from blown packs of vacuum-packaged beef.
AB  == bacteria recovered from the microflora of blown packs of vacuum-packaged beef were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, carnobacterium  maltaromaticum, and clostridium estertheticum, with l. mesenteroides predominant. isolates of these lactic acid bacteria all grew in peptone yeast extract glucose  starch broth (pygsb) at temperatures between -2 and 30 degrees c but generally grew more slowly and over a more restricted temperature range in meat juice medium (mjm). a c. estertheticum isolate and the type strain of c. estertheticum  subsp. estertheticum (atcc 51377) both grew in pygsb and mjm at similar rates at  temperatures between -2 and 17 degrees c and grew at 20 degrees c in mjm but not  in pygsb. square root models of the variation of the growth rate with temperature indicated that the c. maltaromaticum isolate and the c. estertheticum strains grew at similar rates that were faster than those of the other isolates at temperatures between -2 and 0 degrees c. the l. mesenteroides and l. lactis isolates grew in pygsb at ph 5.0, but the c. maltaromaticum isolate and both strains of c. estertheticum did not grow in pygsb at ph <or= 5.3. c. estertheticum stopped growing in mjm buffered at ph 6.5 when glucose was exhausted, although these bacteria then utilized lactate. the findings suggest that, like carnobacteria, c. estertheticum may predominate during the early stages of development of the spoilage microflora of vacuum-packaged beef but that c. estertheticum will likely be inhibited by a falling ph and so may be only a minor part of the spoilage microflora when maximum numbers are attained.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == effect of lactococcus lactis clfp 100 and leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196 on aeromonas salmonicida infection in brown trout (salmo trutta).
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis in salmonid fish.  this pathogen is important from an epizootic perspective because fish surviving an outbreak can remain lifelong asymptomatic carriers, serving as reservoirs of infection. as a result, the early detection and the control of infection are essential to prevent the spread of new furunculosis outbreaks. we have thus analyzed the effect of probiotic administration on the incidence of a. salmonicida in brown trout (salmo trutta), that were subjected to temperature stress. treatment with probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis clfp 100 and leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196) resulted in a higher survival rate after challenge, activation of phagocytic cells in the head kidney, and a lower rate of pathogen proliferation in the intestine as determined by real-time pcr.

AB  == the link between milk production practices and bacterial diversity of 67 raw milks from dairy farms in the savoie and haute-savoie regions of france was studied by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis. the milking practices and the cleanliness of different parts of the cow housing were evaluated. the sscp bacterial profiles allow to classify the 67 milks into three  groups: group a was characterised by a majority of gram-positive non-lactic acid  bacteria (corynebacterineae and micrococcaceae) and a high level of hygiene in milking practices. the sscp profiles of groups b and c were close but different from those of group a: they were both dominated by lactic acid bacteria and by a  less intensive hygiene practices. the group b milks were characterised by the dominance of gram-negative bacteria and lactococcus lactis species while those of group c were dominated by brevibacterium linens and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the variation of balance between bacterial populations can be associated with differences in hygienic milking production practices.

AB  == thirty samples of italian durum wheat semolina and whole durum wheat semolina, generally used for the production of southern italy's traditional breads, were subjected to microbiological analysis in order to explore their lactic acid bacteria (lab) diversity and to find strains with antifungal activity. a total of 125 presumptive lab isolates (gram-positive and catalase-negative) were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr (rep-pcr) and sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene, leading to the identification of the following species: weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus rossiae and lactobacillus plantarum. the rep-pcr results delineated 17 different patterns whose cluster analysis clearly differentiated w. cibaria from w. confusa isolates. seventeen strains, each characterized by a different rep-pcr pattern, were screened for their antifungal properties. they were grown in a flour-based medium, comparable  to a real food system, and the resulting fermentation products (fps) were tested  against fungal species generally contaminating bakery products, aspergillus niger, penicillium roqueforti and endomyces fibuliger. the results of the study indicated a strong inhibitory activity - comparable to that obtained with the common preservative calcium propionate (0.3% w/v) - of ten lab strains against the most widespread contaminant of bakery products, p. roqueforti. the screening  also highlighted the unexplored antifungal activity of l. citreum, l. rossiae and w. cibaria (1 strain), which inhibited all fungal strains to the same or a higher extent compared with calcium propionate. the fermentation products of these three strains were characterized by low ph values, and a high content of lactic and acetic acids.

TI  == analysis of bacterial community during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional  mexican alcoholic beverage, using a polyphasic approach.
AB  == in this study, the characterization of the bacterial community present during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional mexican alcoholic beverage from maguey (agave), was determined for the first time by a polyphasic approach in which both culture and non-culture dependent methods were utilized. the work included the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (lab), aerobic mesophiles, and 16s rdna clone libraries from total dna extracted from the maguey sap (aguamiel) used as substrate, after inoculation with a sample of previously produced pulque and followed by 6-h fermentation. microbiological diversity results were correlated with fermentation process parameters such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and fermentation product concentrations. in addition, medium rheological behavior analysis and scanning electron microscopy in aguamiel and during pulque fermentation were also performed. our results showed that both culture and non-culture dependent approaches allowed the detection of several new and previously reported species within the alpha-, gamma-proteobacteria and firmicutes. bacteria diversity in aguamiel was composed by the heterofermentative leuconostoc citreum, l. mesenteroides, l. kimchi, the gamma-proteobacteria erwinia rhapontici, enterobacter spp. and acinetobacter radioresistens. inoculation with previously fermented pulque incorporated to the system microbiota, homofermentative lactobacilli related to lactobacillus acidophilus, several alpha-proteobacteria such as zymomonas mobilis and acetobacter malorum, other gamma-proteobacteria and an important amount of yeasts, creating a starting metabolic diversity composed by homofermentative and heterofermentative lab, acetic and ethanol producing microorganisms. at the end of the fermentation process, the bacterial diversity was mainly composed by the homofermentative lactobacillus acidophilus, the heterofermentative l. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and the alpha-proteobacteria a. malorum. after a 6-h fermentation, 83.27% of total sugars detected after inoculation were consumed (228.4 mm hexose equivalents) and a carbon (c) recovery of 66.18% in fermentation products was estimated. they were produced 284.4 mm c as ethanol, 71.5 mm c as acetic acid and 19 mm c as lactic acid, demonstrating the presence of homo- and heterofermentative, acetic and alcoholic metabolisms in the final product. it was also found, after hydrolysis, that the exopolysaccharide produced during the fermentation was mainly composed by fructose residues, probably inulin or levan.

AB  == a total of 192 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 2 types of naturally fermented dry sausages at 3 different stages of the ripening process in order to  select the most suitable strains as starter cultures in dry-cured sausage manufacture according to their technological characteristics such as glucose fermentation, lactic and acetic acid production, and proteolytic, lipolytic, and  antimicrobial activities. identification of the isolates revealed that 31.2% were pediococcus pentosaceus, 26.9% lactococcus lactis, 18.6% pediococcus acidilactici, 17% lactobacillus brevis, and sporadic isolates of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus curvatus. most of the strains did not produce gas from glucose and showed the capacity to produce lactic acid rapidly. some 25% of the strains were able to degrade tributyrin (esterase activity), but none showed lipolytic activity against olive oil and pork fat. only 3 strains of p. acidilactici showed weak proteolytic activity against myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic proteins. also, the same strains showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes. nine strains with the best properties were preselected and tested for biogenic amine production. the results showed that two of the strains, identified as p. acidilactici by polymerase chain reaction, had the potential to be further tested as starter cultures in pilot processing of iberian sausages.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria within the consortium of a kefir grain by  sequencing 16s rdna variable regions.
AB  == the microflora of a kefir grain was identified using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy combined with 16s rrna gene sequencing. dna was extracted from the kefir grain and amplified in its 16s rdna v1 and v2 regions. to guarantee a good representation of the overall lactic acid bacteria populations,  dna amplification was performed separately with primers specific either to the dominant or to the less abundant bacterial groups. the amplified fragments were cloned in escherichia coli and then sequenced. sequences of the v1 region were gathered into 5 groups of similarity and identified by aligning with the sequences of a public library. the v1 region allowed the identification of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, l. kefir, l. parakefir, and lactococcus lactis but was inappropriate for the identification of leuconostocs at species level. among  16s rdna variable regions, the v2 region showed the highest variability between leuconostoc species. nevertheless, even in the v2 region, differences were too tenuous for effective identification of l. mesenteroides. the methodology described here allowed detection of the dominant species within each targeted microbial group.

TI  == enhancement of the immune response and protection induced by probiotic lactic acid bacteria against furunculosis in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss).
AB  == we analysed the effect of probiotic strains on the cellular and humoral immune responses of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), and their capacity to prevent furunculosis during a challenge trial. probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis clfp 100, leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196, and lactobacillus sakei clfp 202) were administered orally to fish for 2 weeks at 10(6) cfu g(-1) of feed. in  comparison to untreated control fish, the phagocytic activity of head kidney leukocytes and the alternative complement activity in serum were significantly greater in all probiotic groups at the end of the second week. with the exception of the group fed with lactobacillus sakei, superoxide anion production was also significantly increased in the probiotic groups. analysis of lysozyme activity did not exhibit any significant difference in the probiotic and control groups. fifteen days after the start of the probiotic feeding, fish were challenged with  aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida. the fish supplemented with probiotics exhibited survival rates ranging from 97.8% to 100%, whereas survival was 65.6% in fish not treated with the probiotics. these results demonstrate that probiotic supplementation to fish can reduce the severity of furunculosis, and suggest that this reduction may be associated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == media and process parameters affecting the growth, strain ratios and specific acidifying activities of a mixed lactic starter containing aroma-producing and probiotic strains.
AB  == aims: the effects of medium-composition and fermentation parameters on the properties of mixed mesophilic starters were studied. the starter was composed of lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (l. lactis), lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (l.  cremoris), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lact. rhamnosus) and leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris (leuc. cremoris). methods and results: the media used were reconstituted skim milk (rsm), and whey-based media with either citrate or phosphate buffers. the fermentation parameters were incubation temperature (22 degrees c or 32 degrees c), no ph control, and ph control in ph zones of either ph 6.0-5.8 or ph 6.0-5.2. the starter properties were strain ratio, specific acidifying activity (saa), total population, residual carbohydrates and organic acids produced. the growth of l. lactis was favoured under ph control in whey-based media. high concentrations of lact. rhamnosus were favoured in whey-based media prepared at 32 degrees c. the highest contents of leuc. cremoris were obtained in starters prepared in rsm at 22 degrees c without ph control. starters prepared under ph control gave the highest populations and made it possible for significantly lower inoculation rates (ir) to be used to carry out subsequent milk fermentations. however, the saa of starters prepared under ph control were lower than the saa of starters grown without any ph control. conclusions: none of the conditions enabled the strain ratio at inoculation to be maintained. the data show that it is possible to prepare a mesophilic starter that has a significant probiotic lact. rhamnosus content; this starter could be used in the preparation of probiotic-containing cheeses or in leuc. cremoris for  aroma production in fermented milks. significance and impact of the study: this study provides data on what should be expected with respect to strain ratios and  ir if cheesemakers decide to shift their aroma-producing starter production method from the traditional 'milk-based without ph control' method to whey-based  media used with ph-zone control strategies.

TI  == characterization of italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

TI  == changes in intestinal microbiota and humoral immune response following probiotic  administration in brown trout (salmo trutta).
AB  == we studied the effect of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the humoral response of brown trout (salmo trutta). lab groups (lactococcus (lc.) lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus (lb.) sakei and leuconostoc (leu.) mesenteroides) were administered orally at 10(6) colony-forming units/g feed to brown trout for 2 weeks, after which fish were switched to an unsupplemented feed. blood and intestinal samples were taken from the onset of feeding supplemented diets at 1,  2, 3 and 4 weeks. during the lab-feeding period, lc. lactis ssp. lactis, lb. sakei and leu. mesenteroides persisted in the fish intestines, but the number of  lab slowly decreased in the intestines after changing to the unsupplemented diet. only lb. lactis ssp. lactis and leu. mesenteroides were detected at levels above  1 x 10(2) colony-forming units/g at the end of the fourth week. in comparison to  untreated control fish, the alternative complement activity in the serum was found to be significantly greater in all lab groups at the end of the second week. groups supplemented with lc. lactis ssp. lactis and leu. mesenteroides exhibited an elevated level of lysozyme activity at the end of the third week, but the group supplemented with lb. sakei did not exhibit any significant change  in lysozyme activity. serum immunoglobulin levels were higher compared with the control group, but there was no significant difference between the lab and control groups.

TI  == biodiversity of bacterial ecosystems in traditional egyptian domiati cheese.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity occurring in traditional egyptian soft domiati cheese was  studied by pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). bands were identified using a reference species database (j.-c. ogier et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70:5628-5643, 2004); de novo bands having nonidentified migration patterns were identified by dna sequencing. results reveal a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial  biodiversity in domiati cheeses, as reflected by the numerous bands present in ttge and dgge patterns. the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were as follows: leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus garvieae, aerococcus viridans, lactobacillus versmoldensis, pediococcus inopinatus, and lactococcus lactis. frequent non-lab species included numerous coagulase-negative staphylococci, vibrio spp., kocuria rhizophila, kocuria kristinae, kocuria halotolerans, arthrobacter spp./brachybacterium tyrofermentans. this is the first time that the majority of these species has been identified in domiati cheese. nearly all the dominant and frequent bacterial species are salt tolerant, and several correspond to known marine bacteria. as domiati cheese contains 5.4 to 9.5% nacl, we suggest that these bacteria are likely to have an important role in the ripening process. this first systematic study of the microbial composition of domiati cheeses reveals great biodiversity and evokes a role for marine bacteria in determining cheese type.

TI  == isolation and identification of a paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  == a new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain osy-df. the antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin e1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an  unknown 2,983-da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. the latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. the antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including bacillus spp., clostridium sporogenes, lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, listeria spp., pediococcus cerevisiae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae. furthermore, it  possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali  (ph 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. while details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic,  with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. the coproduction of polymyxin e1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. the new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical  applications.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == artisanal and experimental pecorino siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and pcr-dgge analyses.
AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == new expression system tightly controlled by zinc availability in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == here we developed the new expression system p(zn) zitr, based on the regulatory signals (p(zn) promoter and zitr repressor) of the lactococcus lactis zit operon, involved in zn(2+) high-affinity uptake and regulation. a p(zn) zitr-controlled expression vector was constructed, and expression regulation was studied with two reporter genes, uspnuc and laclm; these genes encode, respectively, a protein derived from staphylococcus aureus secreted nuclease and leuconostoc mesenteroides cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase. nuclease and beta-galactosidase activities of l. lactis mg1363 cells expressing either uspnuc or laclm under the  control of p(zn) zitr were evaluated on plates and quantified from liquid cultures as a function of divalent metal ion, particularly zn(2+), availability in the environment. our results demonstrate that p(zn) zitr is highly inducible upon divalent cation starvation, obtained either through edta addition or during  growth in chemically defined medium, and is strongly repressed in the presence of excess zn(2+). the efficiency of the p(zn) zitr expression system was compared to that of the well-known nisin-controlled expression (nice) system with the same reporter genes cloned under either p(zn) zitr or p(nisa) nisrk control. laclm induction levels reached with both systems were on the same order of magnitude, even though the nice system is fivefold more efficient than the p(zn) zitr system. an even smaller difference or no difference was observed after 3 h of induction when nuclease was used as a reporter for western blotting detection. p(zn) zitr proved to be a powerful expression system for l. lactis, as it is tightly controlled by the zinc concentration in the medium.

TI  == genetic organization and expression of citrate permease in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == citrate is present in many natural substrates, such as milk, vegetables and fruits, and its metabolism by lactic acid bacteria (lab) plays an important role  in food fermentation. the industrial importance of lab stems mainly from their ability to convert carbohydrates into lactic acid and, in some species, like lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides, to produce c4 flavor compounds  (diacetyl, acetoin) through citrate metabolism. three types of genetic organization and gene locations, involving citrate metabolism, have been found in lab. citrate uptake is mediated by a citrate permease, which leads to a membrane  potential upon electrogenic exchange of divalent citrate and monovalent lactate.  the internal citrate is cleaved into acetate and oxaloacetate by a citrate lyase, and oxaloacetate is decarboxylated into pyruvate by an oxaloacetate decarboxylase, yielding a ph gradient through the consumption of scalar protons.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == study of the ecology of fresh sausages and characterization of populations of lactic acid bacteria by molecular methods.
AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.

TI  == quantitative 2h nmr at natural abundance can distinguish the pathway used for glucose fermentation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == for any given metabolic pathway, isotope redistribution coefficients (a(ij)) that characterize the specific derivation of each hydrogen atom can be defined. by using quantitative deuterium nmr, the redistribution of deuterium at natural abundance in lactic acid produced by the bacterial fermentation of glucose has been determined for each non-labile hydrogen atom of glucose or water and the hydrogen atoms of lactic acid. distinct differences are observed in the lactic acid isolated from lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides that can be interpreted in terms of the different fermentative pathways used. specifically, the affiliations observed between the h1, h3, and h4 positions of glucose with methyl and hydroxymethylene of lactic acid can give quantitative information on whether the glycolytic or the reductive pentose-phosphate pathway was involved in glucose catabolism.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin salers cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

TI  == behavior of psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiling cooked meat products.
AB  == three kinds of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from spoiling cooked meat products stored below 10 degrees c. they were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and leuconostoc citreum. all three strains grew well in mrs broth at 10 degrees c. in particular, l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. citreum grew even at 4 degrees c, and their doubling times were 23.6 and 51.5 h, respectively. on the other hand, although the bacteria were initially below the detection limit (<10 cfu/g) in model cooked meat products, the bacterial counts increased to 10(8) cfu/g at 10 degrees c after 7 to 12 days.

TI  == bacterial community structure and location in stilton cheese.
AB  == the microbial diversity occurring in stilton cheese was evaluated by 16s ribosomal dna analysis with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. dna templates for pcr experiments were directly extracted from the cheese as well as  bulk cells harvested from a variety of viable-count media. the variable v3 and v4-v5 regions of the 16s genes were analyzed. closest relatives of lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus equorum, and staphylococcus sp. were identified by sequencing of the dgge fragments. fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes were developed to detect lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides in fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) experiments, and their specificity for the species occurring in the community of stilton cheese was checked in fish experiments carried out with reference cultures. the combined use of these probes and the bacterial probe eub338 in fish experiments on stilton cheese sections allowed the assessment of the spatial distribution of the different microbial species in the dairy matrix.  microbial colonies of bacteria showed a differential location in the different parts of the cheese examined: the core, the veins, and the crust. lactococci were found in the internal part of the veins as mixed colonies and as single colonies  within the core. lactobacillus plantarum was detected only underneath the surface, while leuconostoc microcolonies were homogeneously distributed in all parts observed. the combined molecular approach is shown to be useful to simultaneously describe the structure and location of the bacterial flora in cheese. the differential distribution of species found suggests specific ecological reasons for the establishment of sites of actual microbial growth in the cheese, with implications of significance in understanding the ecology of food systems and with the aim of achieving optimization of the fermentation technologies as well as preservation of traditional products.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression analysis of the dextransucrase dsrd of  leuconostoc mesenteroides lcc4 in homologous and heterologous lactococcus lactis  cultures.
AB  == the gene encoding the dextransucrase dsrd from the industrial strain leuconostoc  mesenteroides lcc4 was isolated by pcr using degenerate primers recognizing conserved regions present in other dextransucrase-encoding genes from leuconostoc spp. and southern blot analyses on total genomic dna. n-terminal sequence analysis of the active protein recovered in the culture showed that the secreted  protein of 165 kda is devoid of a 42 aa prepeptide which is removed post-translationally, most likely by signal peptidase cleavage. primer extension  and northern blot analysis identified a monocistronic dsrd mrna with two transcription initiation sites. expression of the dextransucrase dsrd was investigated in ph-controlled fed-batch cultures via northern blot analysis and enzyme activity measurement during the experiments. sucrose levels of 20 g l(-1)  were shown to induce the dsrd biosynthesis around 10-fold. the combination of ph-controlled fed-batch fermentation and northern analysis clearly showed that dsrd expression was related to the growth of the bacteria. dsrd was transferred to and expressed in lactococcus lactis mg1363. controlled fed-batch cultures revealed that active dextransucrase was produced and secreted by the recombinant  l. lactis strain. the expression was independent of sucrose levels. these results show that dextransucrase can be efficiently expressed and secreted in a non-leuconostoc, heterologous host and is able to drive dextran synthesis.

TI  == absence of malolactic activity is a characteristic of h+-atpase-deficient mutants of the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni.
AB  == the lack of malolactic activity in h(+)-atpase-deficient mutants of oenococcus oeni selected previously was analyzed at the molecular level. western blot experiments revealed a spot at 60 kda corresponding to the malolactic enzyme only in the parental strain. moreover, the mlea transcript encoding the malolactic enzyme was not detected by reverse transcription (rt)-pcr analysis of mutants. these results suggest that the malolactic operon was not transcribed in atpase-deficient mutants. the mler gene encoding a lysr-type regulatory protein which should be involved in expression of the malolactic genes was described previously for o. oeni. results obtained in this study show that the mler transcript was not detected in the mutants by rt-pcr. no mutation in the nucleotide sequences of the mler gene and the malolactic operon was found. the effect of a reduction in h(+)-atpase activity on l-malate metabolism was then investigated by using other malolactic bacteria. spontaneous h(+)-atpase-deficient mutant strains of lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were isolated by using neomycin resistance. two mutants were selected. these mutants exhibited atpase activities that were reduced to 54 and 70% of the activities obtained for the l. lactis and l. mesenteroides parental strains, respectively. these mutants were also acid sensitive. however, in contrast to the atpase-deficient mutants of o. oeni, activation of l-malate metabolism was observed with the l. lactis and l. mesenteroides mutants under optimal or acidic growth conditions. these data support the suggestion that expression of the genes encoding malolactic enzymes in o. oeni is regulated by the mler product, as it is in l. lactis. nevertheless, our results strongly suggest that there is a difference between the regulation of expression of the malolactic locus in o. oeni and the regulation of expression of this locus in less acidophilic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations actimel and indian dahi.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. the design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the delhi university college hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre nand nagri, a resettlement colony in east delhi. children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. group 1 was given a fermented milk, actimel, containing 10(8) of each lactobacillus casei dn-114001,  lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus per gram. group 2 was given indian dahi (lf 40) containing 10(8) of each lactococcus lactis, lactococcus lactis cremoris and leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. in the hospital study  indian dahi and actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3  and 0.6 day (p<0.001), respectively. the corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (p<0.05), respectively. the families using actimel as  a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. in conclusion, actimel, fermented milk containing lactobacillus casei dn-114001, and indian dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == evaluation of immunomodulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria in turbot (scophthalmus maximus).
AB  == in the present work, the effects of several lactic acid bacteria on the immune response of turbot (scophthalmus maximus) macrophages have been studied both in vitro and in vivo. out of six lactic acid bacterial strains tested, only heat-killed lactococcus lactis significantly increased the turbot head kidney macrophage chemiluminescent (cl) response after 24 h of incubation. nitric oxide  (no) was also significantly enhanced by this bacterium after 72 h of incubation with either viable (10(3) and 10(6) cells/ml) or heat-killed (10(6) cells/ml) bacteria. viable leuconostoc mesenteroides (10(6) cells/ml) was also capable of significantly increasing no production. since l. lactis proved to be the strain with more effects on the host immune function, further in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted with this bacterium. the in vitro capacity of l. lactis to adhere to turbot intestinal mucus was positively confirmed. when orally administered, l. lactis significantly increased the macrophage cl response and the serum no concentration after 7 days of daily administration. the antibacterial effect of the extracellular products from the six lab strains against the fish-pathogenic bacterium vibrio anguillarum was also demonstrated in vitro.

TI  == dynamics of the microbial community responsible for traditional sour cassava starch fermentation studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative rrna hybridization.
AB  == the microbial community developing during the spontaneous fermentation of sour cassava starch was investigated by cultivation-independent methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partially amplified 16s rdna followed by sequencing of the most intense bands showed that the dominant organisms were all  lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly close relatives of bifidobacterium minimum, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus sp., enterococcus saccharolyticus and lactobacillus plantarum., close relatives of lb. panis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and ln. citreum were also found. a complementary analysis using hybridization of  16s rrna with phylogenetic probes was necessary to detect the presence of the recently discovered species lb. manihotivorans. although it represented up to 13% of the total lactic acid bacteria of sour cassava starch, this species could not  be detected by dgge as the pcr product migrated to the same position as lc. lactis. in addition, it was shown that a strong ph decrease in the time course of fermentation was most probably responsible for the competitive selection of acid-resistant lab vs. both homo and heterofermentative acid-sensitive lab.

TI  == the conserved c-terminus of the citrate (citp) and malate (mlep) transporters of  lactic acid bacteria is involved in substrate recognition.
AB  == the membrane potential-generating transporters citp of leuconostoc mesenteroides  and mlep of lactococcus lactis are homologous proteins with 48% identical residues that catalyze citrate-lactate and malate-lactate exchange, respectively. the two transporters are highly specific for substrates containing a 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif (ho-cr(2)-coo(-)) in which substitutions of the r groups are tolerated well. differences in substrate specificity between mlep and  citp are based on subtle changes in the interaction of the protein with the r groups affecting both binding and translocation properties. the conserved, 46-residue long c-terminal region of the transporters containing the c-terminal putative transmembrane segment xi was investigated for its role in substrate recognition by constructing chimeric transporters. replacement of the c-terminal  region of mlep with that of citp and vice versa did not alter the exchange kinetics with the substrates malate and citrate, indicating that the main interactions between the proteins and di- and tricarboxylate substrates were not  altered. in contrast, the interaction of the proteins with the monocarboxylate substrates mandelate and 2-hydroxyisovalerate changed in a complementary manner.  the affinity of citp for the s-enantiomers of these substrates was at least 1 order of magnitude lower than observed for mlep. introduction of the c-terminal residues of mlep in citp resulted in a higher affinity and vice versa. interchanging the c-termini had a more complicated effect on the r-enantiomers, affecting different kinetic parameters with different substrates, indicating multiple interactions of the r groups at this side of the binding pocket. it is suggested that the binding pocket is located between transmembrane segment xi and the other transmembrane segments of the transporters.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria for bile salt hydrolase activity.
AB  == bile salt hydrolysis is an important metabolic reaction in the bile salt metabolism of mammals. this reaction has a facilitating effect for bile salt excretion but can also be involved in various illnesses. in recent years interest has increased to use bile salt hydrolysis to influence the cholesterol metabolism of humans and farm animals. to understand the distribution and range of bile salt hydrolase activity in lactic acid bacteria, we screened more than 300 strains of  the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus and the species lactococcus lactis,  leuconostoc mesenteroides, and streptococcus thermophilus. results obtained for 273 strains showed that bile salt hydrolase activity is common in bifidobacterium and lactobacillus but absent in l. lactis, leu. mesenteroides, and s. thermophilus. nearly all bifidobacteria species and strains have bile salt hydrolase activity, whereas this activity can only be found in selected species of lactobacilli. a strong correlation can be observed between the habitat of a genus or species and the presence of bile salt hydrolase activity. most often bile salt hydrolase activity is found in strains that have been isolated from the intestines or from feces from mammals--an environment rich in conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. strains and species from other habitats like milk or vegetables--environments from which bile salts are absent--do normally not have bile salt hydrolase activity. in two independent assays, we established that bile salt hydrolase activity in bifidobacteria is, in general, much higher than in lactobacilli.

AB  == the development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. analysis of  rapd fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of  25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides,  leuc. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, strep. bovis, strep. uberis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. garviae, carnobacterium divergens, c. piscicola, aerococcus viridans, staphylococcus carnosus, staph. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, ent. sulphureus and enterococcus spp. the bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. two strains, belonging to strep. thermophilus and l. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; thel. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.

TI  == comparison of partial malolactic enzyme gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis  of some lactic acid bacteria species and relationships with the malic enzyme.
AB  == dna sequences covering 36% of the mle gene that encodes the malolactic enzyme were determined for 13 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing pediococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus and oenococcus genera. the sequences were aligned with the corresponding region of mles in lactococcus lactis. the phylogenetic distance matrix tree of all mle sequences was compared with the 16s rrna phylogenetic tree. the analysis showed that the mle fragment evolved more rapidly than the 16s gene and differently. pediococcus and lactobacillus species were intermixed in the 16s rrna tree whereas they were separated in the mle tree. leuconostoc mesenteroides and oenococcus oeni were distinct from other species in the 16s rrna tree, whereas they were intermixed with lactobacillus species and lactococcus lactis in the mle tree. the amino acid sequences deduced from partial mle genes were aligned with 22 malic enzyme sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree was constructed. malic and malolactic enzymes were distinct at  the phylogenetic level, except for malic enzymes of yeast and escherichia coli which were nearer the malolactic enzymes than the other malic enzymes. the analysis of conserved sites showed several interesting amino acids specific to either malic enzyme or malolactic enzyme.

TI  == identification and characterization of two bacteriocin-producing bacteria isolated from garlic and ginger root.
AB  == two bacteriocin-producing bacterial strains were isolated from garlic and ginger  root by the agar overlay method. the bacteria were identified by 16s rrna sequence analyses and fermentation patterns as leuconostoc mesenteroides (garlic  isolate) and lactococcus lactis (ginger isolate). the bacteriocins were assigned  the names leucocin bc2 and lactocin gi3, respectively. physiochemical properties  and antimicrobial spectra of the bacteriocins were determined by the spot-on-lawn method. both bacteriocins were inhibited by proteolytic enzymes. leucocin bc2 exhibited a narrow antimicrobial spectrum, inhibiting only bacillus, enterococcus, and listeria species. lactocin gi3 had a broader spectrum, inhibiting bacillus, clostridium, listeria, enterococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, and staphylococcus species. both bacteriocins remained active when heated at 90 degrees c for 15 min or 120 degrees c for 20 min. leucocin bc2 assayed at 37 degrees c showed an inhibitory activity of 1,600 au/ml, whereas at  8 degrees c the activity was 12,800 au/ml. conversely, lactocin gi3 activity was  the same at both assay temperatures. both bacteriocins remained active over a ph  range of 2.0 to 9.0 and in various organic solvents. the activity of leucocin bc2 was increased when treated with 0.5% acetic acid and 0.5% lactic acid, whereas lactocin gi3 activity was decreased with either acid. the molecular mass values were 3.7 kda for leucocin bc2 and 3.9 kda for lactocin gi3. these results show that the inhibitory substances produced by the bacteria isolated from garlic and  ginger are bacteriocins that appear to be different in some characteristics from  previously reported bacteriocins.

TI  == stereoselectivity of the membrane potential-generating citrate and malate transporters of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the citrate transporter of leuconostoc mesenteroides (citp) and the malate transporter of lactococcus lactis (mlep) are homologous proteins that catalyze citrate-lactate and malate-lactate exchange, respectively. both transporters transport a range of substrates that contain the 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif, ho-cr(2)-coo(-) [bandell, m., et al. (1997) j. biol. chem. 272, 18140-18146]. in  this study, we have analyzed binding and translocation properties of citp and mlep for a wide variety of substrates and substrate analogues. modification of the oh or the coo(-) groups of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif drastically reduced the affinity of the transporters for the substrates, indicating their relevance in substrate recognition. both citp and mlep were strictly stereoselective when the r group contained a second carboxylate group; the s-enantiomers were efficiently bound and translocated, while the transporters had no affinity for the r-enantiomers. the affinity of the s-enantiomers, and of citrate, was at least 1 order of magnitude higher than for lactate and other substrates with uncharged r groups, indicating a specific interaction between the second carboxylate group and the protein that is responsible for high-affinity binding.  mlep was not stereoselective in binding when the r groups are hydrophobic and as  large as a benzyl group. however, only the s-enantiomers were translocated by mlep. citp had a strong preference for binding and translocating the r-enantiomers of substrates with large hydrophobic r groups. these differences between citp and mlep explain why citrate is a substrate of citp and not of mlep. the results are discussed in the context of a model for the interaction between sites on the protein and functional groups on the substrates in the binding pockets of the two proteins.

TI  == cloning of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis genes and assays of alpha-acetolactate synthase activities in leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris.
AB  == a genomic library from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (lmc) in escherichia coli was screened for alpha-acetolactate synthase (als) activity using a phenotypic test detecting the production of acetolactate or related c4 derivatives (diacetyl, acetoin or 2,3-butanediol) in the culture. four recombinant e. coli clones, with plasmids containing overlapping dna fragments and displaying anabolic als activity, were selected. this activity is encoded by  an ilvb gene belonging to a putative operon which contains genes highly similar to the genes of the branched chain amino acid (bcaa) operon of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. this putative bcaa operon is not functional as the ilva gene is interrupted by a single mutation and the strain is auxotrophic for the three bcaas. only a very low anabolic als activity was present in cell-free extracts of lmc and no transcript from the ilvb gene could be detected. instability of ilvb expression in e. coli was the consequence of a frequent is5 insertion sequence in this gene. despite the detection of a high catabolic als activity in lmc, no catabolic als activity gene could be found in the bcaa gene locus, indicating the presence of a catabolic als gene in the lmc chromosome that could be absent or not expressed in the screened library.

TI  == effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
AB  == the impact of a novel type of modified atmosphere (ma), referred to as high o2-ma, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. pure cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter agglomerans, aureobacterium strain 27, candida guilliermondii, c. sake, salmonella typhimurium, salm. enteritidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees c under an atmosphere composed of o2 (80 or 90%, balanced with n2), co2 (10 or 20%, balanced with n2), or a combination of both gases. in general, exposure to high o2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while co2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in  combination. with minimally-processed vegetables, where co2 levels of around 20%  or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high o2 and 10-20% co2 may provide adequate suppression of  microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.

TI  == physical map of the genome of oenococcus oeni psu-1 and localization of genetic markers.
AB  == a physical map of the chromosome of oenococcus oeni psu-1 was constructed. this represents the first map for a strain of this species. a total of 37 restriction  sites for the rare-cutting endonucleases ascl, fsel, notl and sfil were mapped on the chromosome, which was found to be circular with an estimated size of 1857 kb. fragment order was determined using several approaches: analysis of partial and double digestions, two-dimensional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, isolation of linking clones, and southern hybridization with labelled restriction fragments both from psu-1 and from o. oeni strain gm. oenococcal genes alss/alsd, mlea and  mir, two phage attachment sites and recurrent sequences such as is1165-like elements and rrn loci were located on the physical map. specific fragments hybridizing with gene probes from lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and bacillus subtilis were also identified. the two ribosomal operons have been precisely located and their transcription direction determined.

TI  == mechanism of the citrate transporters in carbohydrate and citrate cometabolism in lactococcus and leuconostoc species.
AB  == citrate metabolism in the lactic acid bacterium leuconostoc mesenteroides generates an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane by a secondary mechanism (c. marty-teysset, c. posthuma, j. s. lolkema, p. schmitt, c. divies, and w. n. konings, j. bacteriol. 178:2178-2185, 1996). reports on the energetics  of citrate metabolism in the related organism lactococcus lactis are contradictory, and this study was performed to clarify this issue. cloning of the membrane potential-generating citrate transporter (citp) of leuconostoc mesenteroides revealed an amino acid sequence that is almost identical to the known sequence of the citp of lactococcus lactis. the cloned gene was expressed in a lactococcus lactis cit- strain, and the gene product was functionally characterized in membrane vesicles. uptake of citrate was counteracted by the membrane potential, and the transporter efficiently catalyzed heterologous citrate-lactate exchange. these properties are essential for generation of a membrane potential under physiological conditions and show that the leuconostoc citp retains its properties when it is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane of lactococcus lactis. furthermore, using the same criteria and experimental approach, we demonstrated that the endogenous citp of lactococcus lactis has the  same properties, showing that the few differences in the amino acid sequences of  the citps of members of the two genera do not result in different catalytic mechanisms. the results strongly suggest that the energetics of citrate degradation in lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides are the same; i.e., citrate metabolism in lactococcus lactis is a proton motive force-generating process.

TI  == membrane potential-generating malate (mlep) and citrate (citp) transporters of lactic acid bacteria are homologous proteins. substrate specificity of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter family.
AB  == membrane potential generation via malate/lactate exchange catalyzed by the malate carrier (mlep) of lactococcus lactis, together with the generation of a ph gradient via decarboxylation of malate to lactate in the cytoplasm, is a typical  example of a secondary proton motive force-generating system. the mlep gene was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in a malolactic fermentation-deficient l. lactis strain. functional analysis revealed the same properties as observed in membrane  vesicles of a malolactic fermentation-positive strain. mlep belongs to a family of secondary transporters in which the citrate carriers from leuconostoc mesenteroides (citp) and klebsiella pneumoniae (cits) are found also. citp, but not cits, is also involved in membrane potential generation via electrogenic citrate/lactate exchange. mlep, citp, and cits were analyzed for their substrate  specificity. the 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif r1r2cohcooh, common to the physiological substrates, was found to be essential for transport although some 2-oxocarboxylates could be transported to a lesser extent. clear differences in substrate specificity among the transporters were observed because of different tolerances toward the r substituents at the c2 atom. both mlep and citp transport a broad range of 2-hydroxycarboxylates with r substituents ranging in size from two hydrogen atoms (glycolate) to acetyl and methyl groups (citromalate) for mlep and two acetyl groups (citrate) for citp. cits was much less tolerant and transported only citrate and at a low rate citromalate. the substrate specificities are discussed in the context of the physiological function of the transporters.

TI  == main microbial flora present as natural starters in cebreiro raw cow's-milk cheese (northwest spain).
AB  == thirty samples of cebreiro, a fresh or short-time-ripened raw cow's-milk cheese produced in northwest spain, were analyzed for the presence of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, (amc) lactic acid bacteria (lab), enterococci and micrococcaceae. mean  amc and lab counts exceeding 10(9)/g were higher than those reported for other fresh or short-time-ripened cheeses, although micrococcaceae occurred in lower numbers (< 10(5)/g) than reported for other raw-milk cheeses. out of a total of 126 lab representation isolates, 59 were identified as enterococci (38 as enterococcus faecalis) 30 as lactococci (24 as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis), 25 as leuconostocs (14 as leuconostoc mesenteroides) and 6 were identified as mesophylic lactobacilli. the enterocci in general were more proteolytic and produced more diacetyl/acetoin than the other lab groups lactic acid bacteria isolated. it seems that a starter for making cebreiro cheese should contain these microorganisms so as to reproduce the typical characteristics of traditional raw  milk cebreiro cheeses.

TI  == identification and sequence analysis of is1297, an iss1-like insertion sequence in a leuconostoc strain.
AB  == the insertion sequence (is) iss1 from lactococcus lactis was amplified from lactococcal genomic dna using a primer to the 18-bp inverted repeat sequence. the amplified product hybridized to a single ecori fragment in a total genomic dna digest of leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. dextranicum nzdri 2218. the dna sequence of this iss1-like element (is1297) and the le. mesenteroides sequences flanking the is were determined and compared with other iso-iss1 elements. no direct repeats were found immediately flanking is1297; however, direct repeats were present approximately 60 bp on either side of the insertion site. is1297 contained a major open reading frame (orf) of 681 bp, encoding a putative 226-amino-acid protein with 96.5% homology to the presumed transposase of iss1. an overlapping orf of 174 bp in the same orientation was also present. a putative orf in the opposite orientation to the transposase orf, which has been shown in some iso-iss1 elements, was not present in is1297. is1297 was shown to hybridize  with other dairy leuconostoc strains. this is the first sequence of an iss1-like  element from a genus other than lactococcus; however, is1297 has close similarity to the lactococcal iso-iss1 elements, especially the iso-iss1 element from the lactose plasmid, ptd1.

TI  == microbiological and biochemical characterization of cassava retting, a traditional lactic acid fermentation for foo-foo (cassava flour) production.
AB  == the overall kinetics of retting, a spontaneous fermentation of cassava roots performed in central africa, was investigated in terms of microbial-population evolution and biochemical and physicochemical parameters. during the traditional  process, endogenous cyanogens were almost totally degraded, plant cell walls were lysed by the simultaneous action of pectin methylesterase and pectate lyase, and  organic acids (c(inf2) to c(inf4)) were produced. most microorganisms identified  were found to be facultative anaerobes which used the sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) present in the roots as carbon sources. after 24 h of retting, the  fermentation reached an equilibrium that was reproducible in all the spontaneous  fermentations studied. lactic acid bacteria were largely predominant (over 99% of the total flora after 48 h) and governed the fermentation. the epiphytic flora was first replaced by lactococcus lactis, then by leuconostoc mesenteroides, and  finally, at the end of the process, by lactobacillus plantarum. these organisms produced ethanol and high concentrations of lactate, which strongly acidified the retting juice. in addition, the rapid decrease in partial oxygen pressure rendered the process anaerobic. strict anaerobes, such as clostridium spp., developed and produced the volatile fatty acids (mainly butyrate) responsible, together with lactate, for the typical flavor of retted cassava. yeasts (mostly candida spp.) did not seem to play a significant role in the process, but their increasing numbers in the last stage of the process might influence the flavor and the preservation of the end products.

AB  == transposon tn917-ltv1 was used to produce a collection of lactococcus lactis strains with fusion of a promoterless lacz gene to chromosomal loci. screening 2,500 tn917-ltv1 integrants revealed 222 that express beta-galactosidase on plates at 30 degrees c. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed tn917-ltv1 insertions in at least 13 loci in 15 strains analyzed. integrants in which beta-galactosidase expression was regulated by temperature or ph and/or arginine  concentration were isolated. in most cases, the regulation observed on plates was reproducible in liquid medium. one integrant, pa170, produces beta-galactosidase  at ph 5.2 but not at ph 7.0, produces more beta-galactosidase at 15 degrees c than at 30 degrees c, and has increased beta-galactosidase activity in the stationary phase. dna fragments potentially carrying promoters from selected lactococcus lactis integrants were cloned in escherichia coli. a new promoter probe vector, pak80, containing promoterless beta-galactosidase genes from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis citrate plasmid replication region was constructed, and the lactococcal fragments were inserted. plasmid pak80 was capable of detecting and discriminating even weak promoters in lactococcus lactis. when inserted in pak80, the promoter cloned from pa170 displayed a regulated expression of beta-galactosidase analogous to the regulation observed in pa170.
