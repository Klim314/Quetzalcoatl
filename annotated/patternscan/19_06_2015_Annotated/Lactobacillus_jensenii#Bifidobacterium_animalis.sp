TI  == probiotic viability and physico-chemical and sensory properties of plain and stirred fruit yogurts made from goat's milk.
AB  == probiotic plain and stirred fruit yogurts were made from goat's milk using bacterial cultures comprising, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and propionibacterium jensenii 702. the products were stored at 4 degrees c for 4weeks, during which time the viability of the yogurt starter culture and probiotic bacteria was analysed weekly. p. jensenii 702 demonstrated the highest viability (10(8)cfu/g) in all types of yogurt throughout the storage period, while the viability of the bifidobacteria ( approximately 10(7)cfu/g) also remained above the minimum therapeutic level. the  viability of l. acidophilus la-5 fell below 10(6)cfu/g in yogurts, however, the addition of fruit juice appeared to support the viability of lactobacilli, with higher microorganism numbers observed in fruit yogurts than in plain yogurt throughout the shelf life. addition of fruit juice significantly increased the syneresis, and decreased viscosity and water holding capacity of yogurts (p<0.05), and also enhanced their sensory acceptability.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.
