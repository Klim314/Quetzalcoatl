TI  == development and validation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the diagnosis of porcine proliferative enteropathy.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using a sonicated pure culture of lawsonia intracellularis as the antigen (so-elisa). a total of 332 serum samples, consisting of 232 experimentally infected animals and 100 animals naturally infected with l. intracellularis, were used to assess the diagnostic sensitivity. three hundred and fifty-five sera from uninfected animals were used to determine  the diagnostic specificity. the receiver operating characteristic and mean +3 standard deviation of optical density (od) values from uninfected animals were used for selecting cut-off points. the diagnostic accuracy of so-elisa was considered to be high as the area under the curve index was 0.991 with 0.0029 standard error. the optimal cut-off for so-elisa was set at 0.45 od with 89.8% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity based on a combination of good sensitivity and  high specificity. no cross-reactivity was found in sera from pigs exposed to brachyspira pilosicoli, b. hyodysenteriae, campylobacter mucosalis, c. jejuni, or c. coli. inter- and intracoefficient of variation of all control sera tested with so-elisa was less than 10%. the observed agreements between so-elisa and the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay tested with experimental challenge animals and field samples were 95.08% with 0.88 kappa and 90.65% with 0.74 kappa value, respectively. so-elisa was able to detect the seroconversion of infected animals  at 2 to 4 weeks after exposure to l. intracellularis. based on the validation results, so-elisa could be used as an alternative serology for proliferative enteropathy diagnosis.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of fus-1 (oxa-85), a narrow-spectrum class d beta-lactamase from fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
AB  == previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. an f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. dna cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class d beta-lactamase named fus-1 (oxa-85). a recombinant escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(fus-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate  decrease in the mics with clavulanic acid. the bla(fus-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. it was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class d beta-lactamase gene. the fus-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with oxa-63 from brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). fus-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class d beta-lactamases. kinetic analysis revealed that fus-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. fus-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and nacl. fus-1 is the first example of a class d beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.

TI  == identification of serpulina species associated with porcine colitis by biochemical analysis and pcr.
AB  == a pcr system for the detection and identification of group iv spirochetes (serpulina pilosicoli) was designed to complement biochemical tests, e.g., the hippurate hydrolysis and beta-glucosidase tests, and to verify the accuracy of a  previously proposed biochemical classification system. the pcr assay was based on amplification of a segment of the 16s rrna gene. both primers were constructed to selectively amplify the 16s rrna gene of serpulina pilosicoli. all analyzed serpulina strains exhibiting the capacity to hydrolyze hippurate and lacking beta-glucosidase activity, including the type strain for spirochetal diarrhea, p43, were amplified with the pcr system. all other tested strains, including type and field strains of different phenotypes of serpulina species, as well as salmonella species, campylobacter species, and escherichia coli strains, were negative in the assay. among the tested strains were 18 scottish field isolates originating from the mucosae of pigs with colitis. a simple classification scheme, suitable for routine classification of porcine intestinal spirochetes, is also presented. the scheme is based on hemolysis, indole production, and the hippurate hydrolysis test.
