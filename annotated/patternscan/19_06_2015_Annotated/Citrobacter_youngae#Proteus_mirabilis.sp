TI  == production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  == histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of enterobacteriaceae (41 of hafnia alvei, 17 of serratia liquefaciens, 5 of enterobacter cloacae, 4 of citrobacter braakii, 2 of proteus vulgaris, 2 of proteus mirabilis, 2 of providencia stuartii, 2 of klebsiella terrigena, 1 of rahnella aquatilis, 1 of salmonella arizonae, 1 of citrobacter youngae and 1 of escherichia coli) isolated from botillo, a spanish traditional sausage. in general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the  exception of two strains of h. alvei and the e. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. the strains of p. mirabilis and p. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 7325 mg/l in a h. alvei strain. maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 1935 mg/l in a s. liquefaciens strain.
