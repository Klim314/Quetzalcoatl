biotechnological potential of clostridium butyricum bacteria.
in response to demand from industry for microorganisms with auspicious biotechnological potential, a worldwide interest has developed in bacteria and fungi isolation. microorganisms of interesting metabolic properties include non-pathogenic bacteria of the genus clostridium, particularly c. acetobutylicum, c. butyricum and c. pasteurianum. a well-known property of c. butyricum is their ability to produce butyric acid, as well as effectively convert glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (38.2 g/l). a conversion rate of 0.66 mol 1,3-propanediol/mol of glycerol has been obtained. results of the studies described in the present paper broaden our knowledge of characteristic features of c. butyricum specific isolates in terms of their phylogenetic affiliation, fermentation capacity and antibacterial properties.
butanol and ethanol production from tapioca starch wastewater by clostridium spp.
total (tww) and tapioca starch wash wastewater (tsww) from a cassava processing plant in thailand were analyzed for their composition with a view to evaluate their potential as substrates for solvent production by abe fermentation with clostridium spp. starch was detected at a 1.63-fold higher level in the tww than that in the tsww (24.4% and 15.0% (w/w), respectively). the chemical oxygen demand (cod) was broadly similar (20,093 and 20,433 mg/l), but the biological oxygen demand (bod) was 1.84-fold higher (18,000 and 9,750 mg/l) in the tww than that in the tsww. thus, the tsww was selected as a substrate to evaluate its potential for butanol and ethanol production by two clostridium spp. the combined ethanol plus butanol production in the tsww at ph 6.5 was higher than that at ph 4.5, being around 27.8- and 3.4-fold higher in c. butyricum tistr 1032 and c. acetobutylicum atcc 824, respectively. in both strains, the butanol (and combined butanol plus ethanol) production level was improved at ph 5.5. the addition of yeast extract increased the bacterial cell production, but did not significantly improve solvent productivity in c. acetobutylicum, and even decreased butanol production by c. butyricum.
regulation of carbon and electron flow in clostridium butyricum vpi 3266 grown on glucose-glycerol mixtures.
the metabolism of clostridium butyricum was manipulated at ph 6.5 and in phosphate-limited chemostat culture by changing the overall degree of reduction of the substrate using mixtures of glucose and glycerol. cultures grown on glucose alone produced only acids (acetate, butyrate, and lactate) and a high level of hydrogen. in contrast, when glycerol was metabolized, 1,3-propanediol became the major product, the specific rate of acid formation decreased, and a low level of hydrogen was observed. glycerol consumption was associated with the induction of (i) a glycerol dehydrogenase and a dihydroxyacetone kinase feeding glycerol into the central metabolism and (ii) an oxygen-sensitive glycerol dehydratase and an nad-dependent 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase involved in propanediol formation. the redirection of the electron flow from hydrogen to nadh formation was associated with a sharp decrease in the in vitro hydrogenase activity and the acetyl coenzyme a (coa)/free coa ratio that allows the nadh-ferredoxin oxidoreductase bidirectional enzyme to operate so as to reduce nad in this culture. the decrease in acetate and butyrate formation was not explained by changes in the concentration of phosphotransacylases and acetate and butyrate kinases but by changes in in vivo substrate concentrations, as reflected by the sharp decrease in the acetyl-coa/free coa and butyryl-coa/free coa ratios and the sharp increase in the atp/adp ratio in the culture grown with glucose and glycerol compared with that in the culture grown with glucose alone. as previously reported for clostridium acetobutylicum (l. girbal, i. vasconcelos, and p. soucaille, j. bacteriol. 176:6146-6147, 1994), the transmembrane ph of c. butyricum is inverted (more acidic inside) when the in vivo activity of hydrogenase is decreased (cultures grown on glucose-glycerol mixture). for both cultures, the stoichiometry of the h(+) atpase was shown to remain constant and equal to 3 protons exported per molecule of atp consumed.
selective medium for isolation of clostridium butyricum from human feces.
a selective medium, clostridium butyricum isolation medium (bim), is described for the isolation of c. butyricum from human feces. the bim is a synthetic minimal medium and contains trimethoprim (16 micrograms/ml), d-cycloserine (10 micrograms/ml), and polymyxin b sulfate (20 micrograms/ml) as selective inhibitory agents. qualitative tests indicated that c. butyricum and other butyric acid-producing clostridia grew on bim, clostridium sphenoides and bacillus cereus produced small colonies, and other clostridia and other obligate anaerobic or facultatively anerobic bacteria were inhibited. quantitative recovery of c. butyricum from cultures or seeded fecal samples was comparable with bim and with complex medium, but the quantitative recovery of the other butyric acid-producing clostridia tested (c. beijerinckii, c. acetobutylicum) was lower with bim than with complex medium. the bim should aid the rapid isolation of c. butyricum from fecal samples and should be useful for bacteriological investigation of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
