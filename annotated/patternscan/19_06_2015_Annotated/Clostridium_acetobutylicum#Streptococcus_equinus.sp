TI  == cyclic amp in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an examination of camp levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. cellular camp concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, prevotella ruminicola d31d, selenomonas ruminantium hd4 and d, megasphaera elsdenii b159, streptococcus bovis jb1, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. the results were compared to those for escherichia coli nrrl b3704. the levels of camp ranged from undetectable for b. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for p. ruminicola d31d. varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of camp in these organisms. in general, camp concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for e. coli. the levels of camp in p. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. based on these data it seems unlikely that camp is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in p. ruminicola where it may have an unknown  regulatory function.

TI  == purification and characterization of the extracellular alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == the extracellular alpha-amylase (1,4-alpha-d-glucanglucanohydrolase; ec 3.2.1.1)  from maltose-grown streptococcus bovis jb1 was purified to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography (mono q). the enzyme had an isoelectric point of 4.50 and an apparent molecular mass of 77,000 da, as estimated by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme was rich in acidic and hydrophobic amino acids. the 15-amino-acid nh2-terminal sequence was 40% homologous with the bacillus subtilis saccharifying alpha-amylase and 27% homologous with the clostridium acetobutylicum alpha-amylase. alpha-amylase activity on soluble starch was optimal at ph 5.0 to 6.0. the enzyme was relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 8.5 and at temperatures below 50 degrees c.  when soluble potato starch was used as the substrate, the enzyme had a km of 0.88 mg.ml-1 and a kcat of 2,510 mumol of reducing sugar.min-1.mg of protein-1. the enzyme exhibited neither pullulanase nor dextranase activity and was 40 to 70% as active on amylopectin as on amylose. the major end products of amylose hydrolysis were maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose.
