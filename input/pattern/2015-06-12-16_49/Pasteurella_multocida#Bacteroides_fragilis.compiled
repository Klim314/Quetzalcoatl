TI  - Evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in Italy for treatment of canine infections. Of the anaerobic bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by Peptostreptococcus + Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. Of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with Escherichia coli or Pasteurella multocida. Resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. Anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics tested. The emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - The comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. The new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l). Among other Gram-positive organisms tested, a significant number were resistant to A-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. A-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against Pasteurella multocida and Campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against Legionella spp. (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/l) and Bact. melaninogenicus (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). Activity of A-56268 was pH dependent (more active at pH 7 than at pH 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. The drug was bactericidal against two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Str. faecalis.
