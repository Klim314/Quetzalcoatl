TI  == performance evaluation of a dna chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  == background: to prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. stdetect(r) chip is a dna chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13  major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. we evaluated the analytical performance of the stdetect(r) chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. methods: the target pathogens of the stdetect(r) chip are chlamydia trachomatis, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, trichomonas vaginalis, and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. performance of the stdetect(r) chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex pcr assay. and precision tests for stdetect(r) chip were performed with quality control materials. results: the stdetect(r) chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. the stdetect(r) chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, c. albicans, g. vaginalis, m. hominis, and u. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. comparing to multiplex pcr assay, stdetect(r) chip showed better sensitivity for detecting m. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and u. urealyticum  (93.2% vs. 65.9%). in precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. conclusion: the stdetect(r) chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.

TI  == bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern poland.
AB  == objectives: the objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of  an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. material and methods: the study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already  given birth to healthy children. the material for the presence of c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, m. genitalium, m. hominis and u. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by pcr. furthermore, bd probetec et system was used to detect c. trachomatis infection. vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. results: u. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of  controls. presence of m. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and c.  trachomatis only in latter (3%). n. gonorrhoeae and m. genitalium were not found  in any of the examined women. the frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. there were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). conclusions: despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. bv develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.

TI  == microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  == purpose: collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. in order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to  investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents  present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. methods: in a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from january 2009 to october 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. all the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. cultures for common bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. results: the most  frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. in particular, streptococci were  found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (enterococcus faecalis  and escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. u. urealyticum was detected  in 10% and mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). no cases of n. gonorrhoeae were found. conclusions: cervical culture has a low concordance with  endometrial culture. in fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in  the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. these results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == value of counting white blood cells (wbc) in semen samples to predict the presence of bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the correlation between the presence of white blood cells (wbc) without the use of specific stain to differentiate leukocytes and the presence of bacteria in semen samples of infertile men. methods: a total of 143 semen samples of men who attended an andrologic clinic for the evaluation of fertility were investigated using routine semen analysis (according to who laboratory guidelines) and bacterial culture. results: wbc were found in 43.4% (62/143). there were no wbc in 56.6% (81/143) of the samples (group i) while wbc  were found in 43.4% (62/143) of the samples (group ii). pathogenic bacteria were  detected in 48.2% (39/81) in group i and in 54.9% (34/62) in group ii, all in all bacteriospermia was present in 51.1% (73/143). the most common bacteria were ureaplasma urealyticum, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli (23.8%, 16.8%, and 7.0% of samples, respectively). the sensitivity/specificity for detecting bacteria was 0.47/0.60 at a cut-off level of 0.25 mio/ml wbc and 0.16/0.84 at a cut-off level of wbc 1 mio/ml, representing likelihood ratios of 1.16 and 1.04, respectively. the greatest ratio between sensitivity and specificity (0.37/0.72)  was found at a cut-off level of 0.5 mio/ml wbc, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29.  conclusions: counting wbc instead of a specific stain for the detection of leukocytes has only a poor sensitivity/specificity for the detection of bacteria.

TI  == detection of sexually transmitted pathogens in patients with hematospermia.
AB  == background: although the current literature attributes most cases of hematospermia to an infectious agent, identification of the specific pathogens involved has been limited. objectives: to determine the prevalence of different pathogens in patients presenting with hematospermia to our sexually transmitted disease clinic. methods: between january 1999 and january 2000, 16 patients presented to our std clinic with hematospermia after other noninfectious pathologies had been excluded by a referring physician. after obtaining informed  consent, subjects completed a questionnaire addressing symptoms and sexual behavior. first-void urine samples, as well as genitourinary and serum specimens  were tested for chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum and herpes simplex  virus. standard bacterial cultures were also performed. results: laboratory testing detected a pathogen in 12 of the 16 males presenting with hematospermia.  the sexually transmitted pathogens detected were herpes simplex virus in 5 patients (42%), chlamydia trachomatis in 4 (33%), enterococcus fecalis in 2 (17%), and ureaplasma urealyticum in 1 (8%). in all cases in which a pathogen was identified, the appropriate antimicrobial agent was administered. symptoms resolved for each patient following antimicrobial therapy. during a 1 year follow-up, all 12 patients remained free of disease. conclusions: recent advances in microbiologic diagnostic techniques have facilitated the detection of pathogens in patients with hematospermia, thereby enhancing the efficacy of treatment.

TI  == cervical immunoglobulin a and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin a concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. the results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. there was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a (iga) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). the median of cervical iga levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm  (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical iga concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest iga levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). measurement of cervical iga concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

TI  == detection of cervical immunoglobulin a in normal pregnancy.
AB  == the aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. in 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. in this cervical mucus immunoglobulin a concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. a vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each  woman. concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. there was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55  (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora  showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin a concentration than those  with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). the serum levels of immunoglobulins a, a1, a2, m and g do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin a levels nor to gestational age. in normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin a concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin a levels.

TI  == in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) was very active against gram-negative species examined  including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp., neisseria spp. and escherichia coli (mic90s < or = 0.03 mg/l). in general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative species. trovafloxacin was active against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90s < or = 0.25  mg/l). against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. in addition, chlamydia  spp., mycoplasma spp. and ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.

TI  == the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  == tetracycline resistance genes of the m class, tet(m), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. by comparing the sequences of eight different tet(m) genes (from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, and neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. the two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and  a different g/c content. the block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(m) locus. unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(m) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the  species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(m) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.

TI  == the microbiology of post-cesarean wound morbidity.
AB  == objective: to determine the microbiology of wound morbidity following cesarean deliveries. methods: nine hundred thirty-nine wounds in post-cesarean patients were followed prospectively. aspirates from the abdominal incision were collected if the wounds developed erythema, induration, or pain and had demonstrable fluid  collection noted on ultrasound. cultures were also obtained of wound exudates when there was spontaneous separation of the skin. gram stains were performed concomitantly with culture. results: the cumulative incidence of post-cesarean wound morbidity between september 1990 and june 1991 was 6.9% (65 of 939), and the rate of culture-positive wounds was 72% (47 of 65). ureaplasma urealyticum was the most frequent isolate at a rate of 62% (29 of 47), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci at 32% (15 of 47) and enterococcus faecalis at 28% (13 of 47). gram stains of the exudates obtained were used to predict microbiologic results. organisms present on gram stain yielded a sensitivity of 0.55, specificity of 1.0, positive predictive value of 1.0, and negative predictive value of 0.71 when used to predict positive culture results for bacterial wound infection other than with genital mycoplasmas. white blood cell counts greater than ten per 400x high-power fields yielded a sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.72, positive predictive value of 0.89, and negative predictive value of 0.62 when used to predict wound infection including genital mycoplasmas. conclusions: genital mycoplasmas are the most prevalent bacterium in post-cesarean wound infections in this population. if genital mycoplasmas are pathogenic in this setting, then the gram stain may be useful in predicting wound microbiology. more research is needed on the pathogenic role of genital mycoplasmas in wound infections.
