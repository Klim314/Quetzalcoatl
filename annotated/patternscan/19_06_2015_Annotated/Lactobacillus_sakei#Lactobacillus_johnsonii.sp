TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == non-pathogenic bacteria elicit a differential cytokine response by intestinal epithelial cell/leucocyte co-cultures.
AB  == background and aim: intestinal epithelial cells (iec) are thought to participate  in the mucosal defence against bacteria and in the regulation of mucosal tissue homeostasis. reactivity of iec to bacterial signals may depend on interactions with immunocompetent cells. to address the question of whether non-pathogenic bacteria modify the immune response of the intestinal epithelium, we co-cultivated enterocyte-like caco-2 cells with human blood leucocytes in separate compartments of transwell cultures. methods: caco-2/pbmc co-cultures were stimulated with non-pathogenic bacteria and enteropathogenic escherichia coli. expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin (il)-1beta, il-8, monocyte chemoattracting protein 1 (mcp-1), and il-10 was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (cytokine secretion) and by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. results: challenge of caco-2 cells with non-pathogenic e coli and lactobacillus sakei induced expression of il-8, mcp-1, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha mrna in the presence of underlying leucocytes. leucocyte sensitised caco-2 cells produced tnf-alpha and il-1beta whereas il-10 was exclusively secreted by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. caco-2 cells alone remained hyporesponsive to the bacterial challenge. lactobacillus johnsonii, an intestinal isolate, showed reduced potential to induce proinflammatory cytokines but increased transforming growth factor beta mrna in leucocyte sensitised caco-2 cells. tnf-alpha was identified as one of the early mediators involved in cellular cross talk. in the presence of leucocytes, discriminative activation of caco-2 cells was observed between enteropathogenic e coli and non-pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: the differential recognition of non-pathogenic bacteria by caco-2 cells required the presence of underlying leucocytes. these results strengthen the hypothesis that bacterial signalling at the mucosal surface is dependent on a network of cellular interactions.

TI  == activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by nonpathogenic bacteria  in vitro: evidence of nk cells as primary targets.
AB  == the interaction of commensal bacteria with immunocompetent cells may occur in definite compartments of the mucosal immune system, as limited translocation through the epithelial barrier cannot be excluded. in this study the stimulation  of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified lymphocyte subsets by nonpathogenic gram-positive lactobacilli (lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus sakei) and gram-negative escherichia coli was investigated. the various bacterial strains induced a differential cytokine pattern. whereas l. johnsonii and l. sakei strongly induced gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and interleukin-12 (il-12), e. coli and lipopolysaccharide (lps) preferentially induced il-10 after 16 h of stimulation. expression of activation antigens cd69 and cd25 was observed on (cd3(-) cd56(+)) natural killer (nk) cells after stimulation of total human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. all bacteria mediated the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the strongest proliferative response was observed with l. johnsonii. purified cd4(+), cd8(+), and cd19(+) lymphocyte subsets were not activated upon bacterial stimulation but showed normal response to a mitogenic stimulus. in contrast, purified nk cells upregulated the il-2ralpha chain (cd25) and underwent proliferation when stimulated by l. johnsonii. e. coli and lps were less effective in inducing proliferation. expression of cd25 or secretion of ifn-gamma from purified nk cells was significantly increased in the presence of bacterially primed macrophages, indicating that full activation required both bacterium- and  cell contact-based signals derived from accessory cells.
