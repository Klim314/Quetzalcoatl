TI  - Antibacterial effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers against Streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (VicK).
AB  - Two-component systems (TCSs) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. VicK/VicR is one of TCSs in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. We have previously obtained several Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. In this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated based on in vivo and in vitro assays. The results showed that the MICs of 5'-(Methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against S. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/mL, respectively. Time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against S. pneumoniae D39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in CFU after exposure to compounds at four times of the MIC for 24 h. The five compounds inhibited the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on Vero cells. Survival time of the mice infected by S. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. Importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of S. pneumoniae. Moreover, even at sub-MIC concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. The five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. Deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. Taken together, our results suggest that these novel VicK inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - An internal thioester in a pathogen surface protein mediates covalent host binding.
AB  - To cause disease and persist in a host, pathogenic and commensal microbes must adhere to tissues. Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. To date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a 'chemical harpoon'. This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions. This represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering beneficial interactions.
TI  - Frequency of Spontaneous Resistance to Peptide Deformylase Inhibitor GSK1322322 in Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The continuous emergence of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria is compromising the successful treatment of serious microbial infections. GSK1322322, a novel peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibitor, shows good in vitro antibacterial activity and has demonstrated safety and efficacy in human proof-of-concept clinical studies. In vitro studies were performed to determine the frequency of resistance (FoR) to this antimicrobial agent in major pathogens causing respiratory tract and skin infections. Resistance to GSK1322322 occurred at high frequency through loss-of-function mutations in the formyl-methionyl transferase (FMT) protein in Staphylococcus aureus (4/4 strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes (4/4 strains), and via missense mutations in Streptococcus pneumoniae (6/21 strains), but these mutations are associated with a severe in vitro and/or in vivo fitness cost. The overall FoR to GSK1322322 was very low in Haemophilus influenzae with only one PDF mutant identified in one of four strains. No target-based mutants were identified from S. pyogenes, and only one or no PDF mutants were isolated in three of the four S. aureus strains studied. In S. pneumoniae, PDF mutants were only isolated from six of 21 strains tested and an additional 10 strains did not yield colonies on GSK1322322-containing plates. Most of the PDF mutants characterized from these three organisms (35/37), carried mutations in residues at or in close proximity to one of three highly conserved motifs, which are part of the active site of the PDF protein, with 30 of the 35 mutations occurring at position V71 (S. pneumoniae numbering system).
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The Japanese Three Academic Societies Joint Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance Committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. The surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. Patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between January 2011 and June 2012 were investigated. The collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected bacteria was measured at the Kitasato University Research Center for Infections and Antimicrobials. The surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp.). Bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. We compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. The age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. We were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae. We suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.
TI  - Essential Genes in the Core Genome of the Human Pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) remains a major public health burden worldwide, infecting over 750 million people leading to over 500,000 deaths annually. GAS pathogenesis is complex, involving genetically distinct GAS strains and multiple infection sites. To overcome fastidious genetic manipulations and accelerate pathogenesis investigations in GAS, we developed a mariner-based system (Krmit) for en masse monitoring of complex mutant pools by transposon sequencing (Tn-seq). Highly saturated transposant libraries (Krmit insertions in ca. every 25 nucleotides) were generated in two distinct GAS clinical isolates, a serotype M1T1 invasive strain 5448 and a nephritogenic serotype M49 strain NZ131, and analyzed using a Bayesian statistical model to predict GAS essential genes, identifying sets of 227 and 241 of those genes in 5448 and NZ131, respectively. A large proportion of GAS essential genes corresponded to key cellular processes and metabolic pathways, and 177 were found conserved within the GAS core genome established from 20 available GAS genomes. Selected essential genes were validated using conditional-expression mutants. Finally, comparison to previous essentiality analyses in S. sanguinis and S. pneumoniae revealed significant overlaps, providing valuable insights for the development of new antimicrobials to treat infections by GAS and other pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Pathogenic Bacterial Nasopharyngeal Colonization and Its Impact on Respiratory Diseases in the First Year of Life: The PATCH Birth Cohort Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For acute respiratory diseases caused by bacteria, colonization in the respiratory tracts is often the first sign, although nasopharynx is the major source of secretions containing pathogens. To understand the pathogenesis of respiratory tract diseases, it is important to analyze the establishment of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. METHODS: Infants with nasopharyngeal swabs were examined at the age of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months for the detection of pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The methods used for detection were bacterial culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: From January 2012 to August 2013, a total of 320 neonates were enrolled, and 120 of them completed the first 12-month study. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen at all 5 time points while the rates declined; in contrast, the other 4 increased during the first year of life. Of our series, the multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection rates were higher than those of bacterial culture. More than 50% of Staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant, and the trend decreased in the same period. In the analysis of factors associated with the development of infant wheeze, infants with maternal atopy [odds ratio (OR): 3.26; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-8.88; P = 0.02] and pneumococcal colonization (OR: 15.64; 95% CI: 3.25-75.35; P = 0.001) had higher rates of wheeze. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial interactions may result in differing pathogen prevalence in the first year of life. In addition, nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization may have an effect on the risk of infant wheeze. The result could help clinicians to clarify the relation between bacterial colonization and respiratory illnesses in infancy.
TI  - Bacterial and Respiratory Viral Interactions in the Etiology of Acute Otitis Media in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected South African Children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and respiratory viruses are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (AOM); however, data from low-middle income countries are sparse. We investigated the etiology of AOM in HIV-infected (HIV+), HIV-uninfected (HIV-) and HIV-exposed clinically asymptomatic for HIV-infection (HEU) South African children. METHODS: Children >/=3 months to <5 years of age with AOM were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2010 (NCT01031082). Middle ear fluid samples were cultured for bacteria; antibacterial susceptibility was done and serotyping undertaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses using immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 260 AOM episodes (HIV+:15; HIV-:182; HEU:63), bacteria were found in 54.6%, including Haemophilus influenzae (30.8%), 98.8% of which were nontypeable, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5.0%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.5%). Nonsusceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin was 64.2%. Respiratory viruses were detected in 74.2% of cases. Human rhinovirus was most frequently detected (37.7%), followed by adenovirus (14.2%) and human bocavirus (11.5%) overall and irrespective of HIV status. Respiratory viruses were identified concurrently with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis (76.9-78.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (63.4%) cultured from middle ear fluid, as well as in 72.0% of episodes negative for any bacteria. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria play an important role in the development of AOM in children. A similar spectrum of pathogens was observed independently of HIV status. Vaccines targeting both nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae may have a broad impact on AOM in South Africa.
TI  - Challenges in the management of acute mastoiditis in children.
AB  - Acute mastoiditis (AM) is a rare but serious complication of otitis media. Recent studies consolidated the role of Streptococcus pyogenes as the second most important etiologic agent of AM and suggested an increased involvement of a relatively new pathogen (Fusobacterium necrophorum). The recently accumulated evidence on AM epidemiology in children is conflicting and not convincing in demonstrating clear trends during the last years. While a significant decrease was recorded in the incidence of pneumococcal invasive disease and complicated AOM following the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, data on the efficacy of these vaccines in the prevention of AM are limited and did not show any remarkable changes in the dynamics of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The clinical findings in AM may differ according to the causative pathogen and different patient age subgroups. Together with computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging became frequently used, particularly in the diagnosis of AM complications. Simple mastoidectomy remains the most reliable and effective surgical intervention for the treatment of subperiosteal abscesses.
TI  - Biological activities and DNA interactions of Amanita ovoidea.
AB  - CONTEXT: Amanita ovoidea (Bull.) Link (Amanitaceae) is a well-known species due to its pleasant aroma and flavor since ancient times in the worldwide. This species is also known in Turkey and people consume it extensively. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medicinal importance of A. ovoidea for human health, to explain the effect of mushroom extracts on bacterial DNA, and to find preventive role on bacterial disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chloroform, acetone, and methanol extracts of A. ovoidea were tested for the antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive bacteria, five Gram-negative bacteria, and yeast using a micro-dilution method. In addition, DNA binding, DNA cleavage activity, and restriction enzyme digestion of the methanol extract of A. ovoidea were examined at different concentrations (40.000-78.125 microg/mL). RESULTS: The highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value observed against the test micro-organisms was with the chloroform extract (MIC 19.5 microg/mL concentration) against Candida albicans. Other highest antimicrobial effects observed against the test micro-organisms were with the methanol extracts against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella enteritidis (MICs, 78 microg/mL concentrations). All concentrations reduced the mobility of plasmid DNA. BamHI and HindIII targeted specially to supercoils and cut them. Amanita ovoidea extract prevented cutting with HindIII by binding especially to the AA region in open circular DNA. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Present results demonstrated that A. ovoidea has excellent antimicrobial and antifungal activities by its DNA interaction activity on pBR322.
TI  - Rgg protein structure-function and inhibition by cyclic peptide compounds.
AB  - Peptide pheromone cell-cell signaling (quorum sensing) regulates the expression of diverse developmental phenotypes (including virulence) in Firmicutes, which includes common human pathogens, e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cytoplasmic transcription factors known as "Rgg proteins" are peptide pheromone receptors ubiquitous in Firmicutes. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of a Streptococcus Rgg protein alone and in complex with a tight-binding signaling antagonist, the cyclic undecapeptide cyclosporin A. To our knowledge, these represent the first Rgg protein X-ray crystal structures. Based on the results of extensive structure-function analysis, we reveal the peptide pheromone-binding site and the mechanism by which cyclosporin A inhibits activation of the peptide pheromone receptor. Guided by the Rgg-cyclosporin A complex structure, we predicted that the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin A analog valspodar would inhibit Rgg activation. Indeed, we found that, like cyclosporin A, valspodar inhibits peptide pheromone activation of conserved Rgg proteins in medically relevant Streptococcus species. Finally, the crystal structures presented here revealed that the Rgg protein DNA-binding domains are covalently linked across their dimerization interface by a disulfide bond formed by a highly conserved cysteine. The DNA-binding domain dimerization interface observed in our structures is essentially identical to the interfaces previously described for other members of the XRE DNA-binding domain family, but the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond buried in this interface appears to be unique. We hypothesize that this disulfide bond may, under the right conditions, affect Rgg monomer-dimer equilibrium, stabilize Rgg conformation, or serve as a redox-sensitive switch.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010: General view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, was conducted by Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010. The isolates were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections during the period from January and April 2010 by three societies. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institutes using maximum 45 antibacterial agents. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 954 strains (206 Staphylococcus aureus, 189 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 182 Haemophilus influenzae, 74 Moraxella catarrhalis, 139 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ratio of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was as high as 50.5%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were 1.1% and 0.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 17.6% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant, 33.5% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant and 11.0% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant strains. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa with metallo beta-lactamase were 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Continuous national surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Development and laboratory evaluation of a real-time PCR assay for detecting viruses and bacteria of relevance for community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia may present with similar clinical symptoms, regardless of viral or bacterial cause. Diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. Therefore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. Technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were used to compare the qPCR assay with standard microbiological methods. The limit of detection was 5 to 20 DNA template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. SDs for positive controls were <5%. The use of the qPCR assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. Diagnostic accuracy of the qPCR assay varied between 60% positive agreement with standard tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 100% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Negative percentage of agreement was >95% for M. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus; whereas it was only 56% for Haemophilus influenzae. Multiple microbial agents were identified in 19 of 44 sputum and 19 of 50 nasopharynx specimens. We conclude that in parallel qPCR detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible. The results indicate good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens.
TI  - Detection of Chlamydophila Pneumoniae and Typical Bacteria in Patients with Chronic Cough.
AB  - The aim of research was to analyze the results of microbiological tests for typical and atypical bacteria in patients with symptoms of chronic cough. A total of 214 outpatients aged from 2 to 94 years (110 women, 64 men, and 40 children) with chronic cough were studied. Four hundred twenty eight throat swabs were examined for atypical bacteria antigen (Chlamydophila pneumoniae) (n = 214) and typical pathogens (n = 214). Chl. pneumoniae detection was performed using indirect immunofluorescence test. Classical microbiological culture was used for typical bacteria detection. Chl. pneumoniae antigen was detected in 55/214 (26.0 %) patients with chronic cough (in 31 (28.2 %) women, 14 (21.9 %) men, and 10 (25.0 %) children). Positive culture for typical pathogens was observed in 30 (27.3 %) women, 22 (34.4 %) men, and 21 (52.5 %) children. Simultaneous occurrence of Chl. pneumoniae and typical pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus strain MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Moraxella catarrhalis) was found in 16 (7.5 %) patients. The findings show that in patients with chronic cough Chl. pneumoniae infection, although less than that with typical pathogens, is rather frequent. Further, the performance of test for Chl. pneumoniae in throat swabs from patients with chronic cough is good and provides an efficient way to diagnose the infection and implement appropriate therapy.
TI  - Eravacycline (TP-434) is efficacious in animal models of infection.
AB  - Eravacycline is a novel broad-spectrum fluorocycline antibiotic being developed for a wide range of serious infections. Eravacycline was efficacious in mouse septicemia models, demonstrating 50% protective dose (PD50) values of </= 1 mg/kg of body weight once a day (q.d.) against Staphylococcus aureus, including tetracycline-resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Streptococcus pyogenes. The PD50 values against Escherichia coli isolates were 1.2 to 4.4 mg/kg q.d. In neutropenic mouse thigh infection models with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and S. pyogenes, eravacycline produced 2 log10 reductions in CFU at single intravenous (i.v.) doses ranging from 0.2 to 9.5 mg/kg. In a neutropenic mouse lung infection model, eravacycline administered i.v. at 10 mg/kg twice a day (b.i.d.) reduced the level of tetracycline-resistant MRSA in the lung equivalent to that of linezolid given orally (p.o.) at 30 mg/kg b.i.d. At i.v. doses of 3 to 12 mg/kg b.i.d., eravacycline was more efficacious against tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in a neutropenic lung infection model than linezolid p.o. at 30 mg/kg b.i.d. Eravacycline showed good efficacy at 2 to 10 mg/kg i.v. b.i.d., producing up to a 4.6 log10 CFU reduction in kidney bacterial burden in a model challenged with a uropathogenic E. coli isolate. Eravacycline was active in multiple murine models of infection against clinically important Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The clinical presentation of Fusobacterium-positive and streptococcal-positive pharyngitis in a university health clinic: a cross-sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharyngitis guidelines focus solely on group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. European data suggest that in patients aged 15 to 30 years, Fusobacterium necrophorum causes at least 10% of cases of pharyngitis; however, few U.S. data exist. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of F. necrophorum; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; and group A and C/G beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and to determine whether F. necrophorum pharyngitis clinically resembles group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: University student health clinic. PATIENTS: 312 students aged 15 to 30 years presenting to a student health clinic with an acute sore throat and 180 asymptomatic students. MEASUREMENTS: Polymerase chain reaction testing from throat swabs to detect 4 species of bacteria and signs and symptoms used to calculate the Centor score. RESULTS: Fusobacterium necrophorum was detected in 20.5% of patients and 9.4% of asymptomatic students. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was detected in 10.3% of patients and 1.1% of asymptomatic students. Group C/G beta-hemolytic streptococcus was detected in 9.0% of patients and 3.9% of asymptomatic students. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 1.9% of patients and 0 asymptomatic students. Infection rates with F. necrophorum, group A streptococcus, and group C/G streptococcus increased with higher Centor scores (P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The study focused on a limited age group and took place at a single institution. Asymptomatic students-rather than seasonal control participants-and a convenience sample were used. CONCLUSION: Fusobacterium necrophorum-positive pharyngitis occurs more frequently than group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal-positive pharyngitis in a student population, and F. necrophorum-positive pharyngitis clinically resembles streptococcal pharyngitis. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Justin E. Rodgers Foundation.
TI  - Flomoxef showed excellent in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens causing community- and hospital-associated infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical pathogens. A total of 545 clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, were isolated consecutively from clinical specimens from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2013. MICs were determined using broth microdilution method. esbl and ampC genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Flomoxef showed excellent activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, with susceptibility rate of 88.8%, 88.3%, and 97.7%, separately. Moreover, flomoxef exhibited great activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, with MIC50/MIC90 of 0.125/(0.5-1) mug/mL. Flomoxef showed MIC50/MIC90 of 0.5/0.5 mug/mL against MSSA, 0.125/0.25 mug/mL against S. pyogenes, and 2/16 mug/mL against S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, flomoxef is one of the cephamycins showing excellent activity against ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis and was also potent against MSSA, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Transduction of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage Phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(A) and tet(O), to other Streptococcus species.
AB  - Phim46.1 - Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(A) and tet(O), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (M phenotype) and tetracycline - is widespread in S. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. Phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among S. pyogenes isolates, but no information is available about its transferability to other Streptococcus species. We thus investigated Phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of different Streptococcus species. Transductants were obtained from recipients of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus suis. Retransfer was always achieved, and from S. suis to S. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. In transductants Phim46.1 retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin C, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. The transductants shared the same Phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved RNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. No transfer occurred to recipients of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. A largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. Growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of Phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in S. suis. The S. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene atl.
TI  - Genetic basis of the association of resistance genes mef(I) (macrolides) and catQ (chloramphenicol) in streptococci.
AB  - In streptococci mef(I) and catQ, two relatively uncommon macrolide and chloramphenicol resistance genes, respectively, are typically linked in a genetic module designated IQ module. Though variable, the module consistently encompasses, and is sometimes reduced to, a conserved approximately 5.8-kb mef(I)-catQ fragment. The prototype IQ module was described in Streptococcus pneumoniae. IQ-like modules have subsequently been detected in Streptococcus pyogenes and in different species of viridans group streptococci, where mef(E) may be found instead of mef(I). Three genetic elements, one carrying the prototype IQ module from S. pneumoniae and two carrying different, defective IQ modules from S. pyogenes, have recently been characterized. All are integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) belonging to the Tn5253 family, and have been designated ICESpn529IQ, ICESpy029IQ and ICESpy005IQ, respectively. ICESpy029IQ and ICESpy005IQ were the first Tn5253 family ICEs to be described in S. pyogenes. A wealth of new information has been obtained by comparing their genetic organization, chromosomal integration, and transferability. The origin of the IQ module is unknown. The mechanism by which it spreads in streptococci is discussed.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - [Epidemiological investigation on respiratory diseases in 1 300 children, in Jinan, Shandong].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of respiratory diseases and to provide  scientific basis for developing relevant control measures. METHODS: 1 300 children with respiratory diseases were treated in hospitals, from Jan. 2013 to May 2014, in the city of Jinan. Characteristics of respiratory diseases were analyzed. RESULTS: The distribution of respiratory diseases in children appeared as: 373 cases of pneumonia (28.7%), 3 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (0.2%), 467 cases of acute bronchitis (35.9%), 102 cases of asthma (7.8%), and 355 cases of upper respiratory tract infection (27.3%). The upper respiratory tract infection contained 168 cases of tonsillitis (12.9%), 91 cases of pharyngitis (7.0%), 52 cases of laryngitis(4.0%)and 44 cases of iaryngopharyngitis (3.4%). The age distribution of cases with children respiratory diseases appeared as:71 cases <1 years old (5.5%), 385 cases as 1-2 years old (29.6%), 534 cases as 3-6 years old (41.1%), 258 cases as 7-12 years old (19.8%)and 52 cases as >13 years old (4.0%). The seasonal distribution of children respiratory diseases appeared as:364 cases in Spring (28.0% ), 163 cases in summer (12.5%), 315 cases in autumn (24.2%)and 458 cases in winter (35.2%). Regional distribution of children respiratory diseases appeared as:516 cases in urban area (39.7%), 225 cases in suburb (17.3%), 376 cases in townships (28.9%)and 183 in villages (14.1%). 725 strains were isolated and identified that containing 349 strains(48.1%) of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 136 strains (18.8%) of Haemophilus influenza, 103 strains (14.2% ) of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 82 strains (11.3% ) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 38 strains (5.2%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, 35 strains(4.8%) of Enterobacter cloacae, 22 strains (3.0%) of Streptococcus pyogenes, 17 strains (2.3%) of Alcaligenes, 16 strains (2.2% of Candida albicans)and 9 strains (1.2%) of Flavobacterium indologenes. 1 288 cases (99.1%) were cured. CONCLUSION: The common respiratory diseases would include bronchiolitis, pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections in children, mostly attacking 3-6 year-olds at preschool stage, with spring, winter, urban and township as the prevalent seasons and areas.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of Monarda punctata essential oil  and its main components against common bacterial pathogens in respiratory tract.
AB  - The aim of the current research work was to study the chemical composition of the essential oil of Monarda punctata along with evaluating the essential oil and its major components for their antibacterial effects against some frequently encountered respiratory infection causing pathogens. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of 13 chemical constituents with thymol (75.2%), p-cymene (6.7%), limonene (5.4), and carvacrol (3.5%) as the major constituents. The oil composition was dominated by the oxygenated monoterpenes. Antibacterial activity of the essential oil and its major constituents (thymol, p-cymene, limonene) was evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The study revealed that the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against different strains. Among the tested strains, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most susceptible bacterial strain showing lowest MIC and MBC values. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most resistant bacterial strain to the essential oil treatment showing relatively higher MIC and MBC values. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the essential oil induced potent and dose-dependent membrane damage in S. pyogenes and MRSA bacterial strains. The reactive oxygen species generated by the Monarda punctata essential oil were identified using 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA).This study indicated that the Monarda punctata essential oil to a great extent and thymol to a lower extent triggered a substantial increase in the ROS levels in S. pyogenes bacterial cultures which ultimately cause membrane damage as revealed by SEM results.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mode of action of the Artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  - Inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. The aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. Gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. The antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MRSA (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MGRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. The essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. The essential oil was most active against S. pyogenes, MRSA (clinical strain), S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. Piperitone and capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. Furthermore, the essential oil of A. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the S. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the S. aureus bacterial cultures. These results indicate that the antibacterial action of A. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. In conclusion, A. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in S. aureus bacterial cultures.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  - Current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. In line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated for their relative DNA binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. Encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against Gram-positive (including resistant MRSA, MRSE, VRE strains) and Gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. The bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with MIC of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of sensitive and resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest DNA binding affinity (DeltaTm of 15.4 degrees C). Asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. Molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with DNA, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. Herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial DNA binding agents.
TI  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins pneumolysin and streptolysin O require binding to red blood cell glycans for hemolytic activity.
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) pneumolysin (Ply) is a key virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Membrane cholesterol is required for the cytolytic activity of this toxin, but it is not clear whether cholesterol is the only cellular receptor. Analysis of Ply binding to a glycan microarray revealed that Ply has lectin activity and binds glycans, including the Lewis histo-blood group antigens. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that Ply has the highest affinity for the sialyl LewisX (sLeX) structure, with a K(d) of 1.88 x 10(-5) M. Ply hemolytic activity against human RBCs showed dose-dependent inhibition by sLeX. Flow cytometric analysis and Western blots showed that blocking binding of Ply to the sLeX glycolipid on RBCs prevents deposition of the toxin in the membrane. The lectin domain responsible for sLeX binding is in domain 4 of Ply, which contains candidate carbohydrate-binding sites. Mutagenesis of these predicted carbohydrate-binding residues of Ply resulted in a decrease in hemolytic activity and a reduced affinity for sLeX. This study reveals that this archetypal CDC requires interaction with the sLeX glycolipid cellular receptor as an essential step before membrane insertion. A similar analysis conducted on streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes revealed that this CDC also has glycan-binding properties and that hemolytic activity against RBCs can be blocked with the glycan lacto-N-neotetraose by inhibiting binding to the cell surface. Together, these data support the emerging paradigm shift that pore-forming toxins, including CDCs, have cellular receptors other than cholesterol that define target cell tropism.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - The Etiology of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.
AB  - Over the years, the commonly used term to describe juvenile idiopathic arthritis  (JIA) has changed. By definition, JIA includes all types of arthritis with no apparent cause, lasting more than 6 weeks, in patients aged less than 16 years at onset. JIA pathogenesis is still poorly understood: the interaction between environmental factors and multiple genes has been proposed as the most relevant working mechanism to the development of JIA. The concept that various microbes that colonize or infect not only the mucosal surfaces, like the oral cavity, but also the airways and gut might trigger autoimmune processes, resulting in chronic arthritides, and JIA was first drafted at the outset of last century. JIA development might be initiated and sustained by the exposure to environmental factors, including infectious agents which affect people at a young age, depending on the underlying genetic predisposition to synovial inflammation. Many data from patients with JIA suggest a scenario in which different external antigens incite multiple antigen-specific pathways, cytotoxic T cell responses, activation of classical complement cascade, and production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this review, emphasis is paid not only to the potential role of parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Barr virus in primis but also to the general involvement of different bacteria as Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bartonella henselae, and Streptococcus pyogenes for the development of immune-mediated arthritides during childhood. No unequivocal evidence favoring or refuting these associations has been clearly proved, and today, the strict definition of JIA etiology remains unknown. The infection can represent a random event in a susceptible individual, or it can be a necessary factor in JIA development, always in combination with a peculiar genetic background. Further studies are needed in order to address the unsolved questions concerning this issue.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potential of Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser - A less explored  Indian mistletoe Growing on Mango Trees.
AB  - Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser (Loranthaceae) is a less-known medicinally important mistletoe species occurring in India. It is used to check abortion, and also in vesical calculi and kidney affections. There are no detailed studies reporting the antimicrobial potential of this plant. Based on the traditional use and the rich phenolic composition of the whole plant, the antimicrobial property of the alcohol extract was analyzed and the results are outlined in the present paper. For the analysis, zone of inhibition, and minimum inhibitory concentration were used, and the total activity was assayed by standard methodologies. The antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria like Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio fischeri, and a fungus Candida albicans. Of the eight tested bacteria, the alcoholic extract of H. elastica was found to be active against K. pneumoniae, A. hydrophila, E. coli, and V. fischeri at concentration ranging from 250 to 500 mug/ml. C. albicans showed inhibition only at a concentration of 2000 mug/ml.
TI  - Bacteriocin protein BacL1 of Enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes L-Ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  - Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, BacL1 and BacA. We previously reported that BacL1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kDa) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan D-isoglutamyl-L-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of E. faecalis when an accessory factor, BacA, is copresent. However, the target of BacL1 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of BacL1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that BacL1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target E. faecalis cells. This specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the SH3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of BacL1. Repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of BacL1 and BacA. The static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting of BacL1 to the cell division-associated site. Furthermore, the targeting of BacL1 was detectable among Gram-positive bacteria with an L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including E. faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that BacL1 specifically targets the L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially lyses the E. faecalis cells during cell division.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients in Nigeria: a 5-year multicentre retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A clear knowledge of the pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a given region and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns is necessary for optimal treatment. We determined the common bacterial pathogens causing CAP in Nigeria and further reviewed their antibiotic senstivity patterns with a view to providing recommendations to improve antibiotic management of CAP. METHODS: Case notes of all adult patients who were 18 years or more admitted to four major tertiary hospitals in South East Nigeria with a diagnosis of CAP between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively studied. To be eligible, patients were required to have sputum culture and sensitivity results available. Socio-demographic, clinical, pre-admission and in-hospital treatment data were also obtained. RESULTS: Of 400 patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of CAP, 232 fulfilled the study criteria; 122 (52.6%) were women and the mean age was 50.6 +/- 18.8 years. Aetiological agents were identified from sputum in 189 (81.5%) patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 90, 47.6%) was the most frequent isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 62, 32.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 24, 12.7%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13, 6.9%). The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin (77%), ceftazidime (75.5%) and ofloxacin (55.8%). The susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics most frequently presecribed for empirical therapy was low (co-amoxiclav, 47.6%; ciprofloxacin, 45.9% and ceftriaxone, 47.6%) and this was associated with higher mortality and/or longer duration of hospital stay in survivors. CONCLUSION: Strep. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae were the most common causes of CAP. The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftazidime. We suggest that these antibiotics should increasingly be considered as superior options for empirical treatment of CAP in Nigeria.
TI  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction for microbiological diagnosis of parapneumonic effusions in Canadian children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by parapneumonic effusion/empyema is an infectious syndrome commonly encountered by physicians caring for children in Canada. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incremental benefit of novel molecular testing for the microbiological diagnosis of pediatric CAP complicated by parapneumonic effusion/empyema in Canada. METHODS: A convenience sample of pleural fluid from 56 children who had been admitted to hospital in Ontario with CAP complicated by parapneumonic effusion between 2009 and 2011 was examined. Multiple uniplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed on these pleural fluids and compared with traditional culture-based testing of blood and pleural fluid samples. RESULTS: Molecular methods detected a pathogen in 82% of cases, whereas traditional cultures of blood and pleural fluids detected a pathogen in only 25%. The majority of parapneumonic effusions were associated with pneumococcal infection; Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 62% of the samples using molecular methods but in only 14% of samples using culture-based methods. Streptococcus pyogenes, detected in 16% of samples using PCR, was the second most common pathogen found. No patients were found to have empyema caused by Staphylococcus aureus. DISCUSSION: The results showed that multiple uniplex real-time PCR performed substantially better than traditional culture methods for microbiological diagnosis of CAP complicated by effusion/ empyema. S pneumoniae and S pyogenes were found to be responsible for the majority of infections. The approach detected pathogens in a similar proportion of pleural fluid samples as previously reported nested PCR assays; furthermore, the real-time closed-well approach also minimized the risk of nonspecificity due to cross-contamination relative to nested PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR for the detection of bacterial DNA in pleural fluids has the potential to better define the microbiological cause of pediatric CAP. This approach could help clinicians provide targeted antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Bacteriology in relation to clinical findings and treatment of acute mastoiditis  in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed clinical, radiological, laboratory and microbiological findings in children with acute mastoiditis in order to improve the diagnostics and treatment of these patients. We also investigated whether different pathogens cause different clinical findings of mastoiditis. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of all children aged 0-16 years treated as in-ward patients for acute mastoiditis at Helsinki University Central Hospital, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, between 2003 and 2012. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of mastoiditis was 1.88/100000/year. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (38%), Streptococcus pyogenes (11%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%). Of S. pneumoniae, 48% had reduced susceptibility (intermediate or resistant) for the common antimicrobials; this was clearly overrepresented relative to the background population (p<0.001). Otalgia and retroauricular symptoms were common in the patients with S. pneumoniae. Otorrhoea was less common (p=0.03) in these patients relative to the other pathogens. Patients with S. pneumoniae had more destruction of the mastoid septa (p=0.05) than patients with any of the other pathogens. Mastoidectomy was performed in 34% of all cases, it was most common (60%) in the patients with S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility. The patients with S. pyogenes had less otalgia and seemed to have less retroauricular symptoms relative to other pathogens. P. aeruginosa especially affected children with tympanostomy tubes, caused otorrhoea in all patients and caused a milder form of disease with less retroauricular swelling (p=0.04) than the other pathogens, and there was no need for mastoidectomies. The younger children (<2 years) had less otorrhoea and more retroauricular symptoms of infection than the older patients. No significant differences emerged in outcome of the patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical findings of acute mastoiditis differ according to the causative pathogen. S. pneumoniae, especially strains with reduced susceptibility, causes severe symptoms and leads to mastoidectomy more often than the other pathogens. S. pyogenes causes less otalgia than the other pathogens. P. aeruginosa particularly affects children with tympanostomy tubes and causes a less aggressive form of disease.
TI  - Respiratory tract infections in the military environment.
AB  - Military personnel fighting in contemporary battlefields as well as those participating in combat training are at risk of contracting respiratory infections. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that soldiers deployed to the harsh environment have higher rates of newly reported respiratory symptoms than non-deployers. Acute respiratory diseases are the principle reason for outpatient treatment and hospitalization among military personnel, with an incidence exceeding that of the adult civilian population by up to three-fold. Adenoviruses, influenza A and B viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, coronaviruses and rhinoviruses have been identified as the main causes of acute respiratory infections among the military population. Although infective pathogens have been extensively studied, a significant proportion of illnesses (over 40%) have been due to unknown causative agents. Other health hazards, which can lead to respiratory illnesses among troops, are extreme air temperatures, desert dust, emissions from burn pits, industrial pollutants, and airborne contaminants originating from degraded soil. Limited diagnostic capabilities, especially inside the area of operations, make it difficult to accurately estimate the exact number of respiratory diseases in the military environment. The aim of the study was to discuss the occurrence of respiratory tract infections in army personnel, existing risk factors and preventive measures.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of acute otitis media and characterization of pneumococcal serotypes and genotypes among children in Moscow, Russia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe bacterial etiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and characterize resistance, serotypes and genotype profiles of AOM-causing pneumococci recovered in Moscow children. METHODS: Children with AOM and an available middle ear fluid specimen were prospectively enrolled in this study. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were considered as true otopathogens. All pneumococcal isolates were serotyped using the Quellung reaction; multidrug-resistant (MDR) pneumococci underwent multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: In 172 of 541 enrolled AOM patients (32%) at least 1 otopathogen was recovered, with S. pneumoniae having the highest rate of 63% (109/172). When adjusted for antibiotic treatment before sampling, in untreated patients the rate of culture-positive AOM was 35% (124/352), S. pneumoniae had a prevalence of 69% (86/124), S. pyogenes 19% (24/124), H. influenzae 13% (16/124) and M. catarrhalis 9% (11/124). Among 107 examined pneumococci, 45% were penicillin-nonsusceptible, 34 and 30% were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively; 30% had an MDR phenotype, but no amoxicillin-resistant isolates were found. Ten of 32 (31%) MDR pneumococci related to clonal complex 320, the remaining isolates belonged to 7 different clonal complex. Six leading serotypes were 19F (27%), 3 (12%), 6B (11%), 14 (11%), 19A (9%) and 23F (8%); overall polysaccharide conjugate vaccine13 coverage was 93%. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae, the leading bacterial AOM pathogen in Moscow children, is characterized by a substantial rate of antibiotic nonsusceptibility and clonality. A polysaccharide conjugate vaccine with expanded coverage seems to fit the current AOM pneumococcal serotype distribution in Russia better.
TI  - Molecular identification of pathogenic bacteria in eschars from acute febrile patients, Senegal.
AB  - Fever caused by Rickettsia felis was recently shown to play an important role in  infectious diseases morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. We collected 68 cotton swabs from fever-associated eschars in four different regions of Senegal. In 5 of 68 eschar samples (7.4%), we have identified DNA from R. felis. In 49 of 68 eschar samples (72.1%), we have identified DNA from Staphylococcus aureus. In 35 of 68 eschar samples (51.5%), we have identified DNA from Streptococcus pyogenes, and in 4 of 68 eschar samples (5.9%), we have identified DNA from Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 34 cases, S. aureus was found together with S. pyogenes. DNA from R. felis was also found in swabs from the skin of the healthy Senegalese villagers (3 of 60; 5%) but not French urbanites. The presence of S. aureus and S. pyogenes was significantly associated with the presence of eschars in febrile patients compared with the healthy skin from the control group. Finally, we confirmed that Senegal is an endemic region for R. felis, which is found in both eschars and healthy skin swabs.
TI  - [Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in children hospitalized in the period  of 2009-2012.]
AB  - Aim:The aim of this study was to analyze etiology of childhood pneumonia in the region of Warsaw and to assess the efficacy and usefulness of standard diagnostic procedures used in search of etiology. Material and methods: 663 patients (323 girls and 340 boys) hospitalized due to pneumonia in the period of 2009-2012 were enrolled. Diagnostic procedures to determine the etiology were performed in 400/663 (60.3%) children. Type of diagnostic procedures depended on medical history, disease's course and patient's condition and included 336 blood cultures, 257 measurements of antibody titers against Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 12 measurements of antibody titers against Bordetella pertussis, 14 pleural fluid cultures (deriving from 9 patients). Using the BiNet network 51 specimens (45 blood specimens, 4 pleural fluid, 2 bacterial strains) were send to the KOROUN in order to perform molecular diagnostic in search of encapsulated bacteria. Results: Etiology of pneumonia was found in 9.7% (64/663) of all patients with diagnosed CAP, what accounted for 16% (64/400) of children in which the diagnostics was taken. The most frequent agent was atypical bacteria which was found in 14.75% (59/400) patients (in 26 patients - Chlamydophila pneumoniae, 11 - Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 22 - mixed infection). Bacterial etiology was confirmed in 1.25% (5/400) of patients (Streptococcus pneumoniae-3 patients, Streptococcus pyogenes i Bordetella pertussis - 1 patient each other). Efficacy of a single blood culture was very low - 0.6% (2/336). Pleural fluid culture was positive only in 1 of 9 drained patients (S. pyogenes). Thanks to the use of BiNet network (KOROUN) etiology of severe pneumonia in 3 patients has been determined. 2 of those patients suffered from invasive pneumococcal disease, which was not diagnosed with standard microbiological procedures (blood cultures). Conclusions:The methods currently used in the diagnosis of pneumonia is inadequate. It was possible to determine the etiology of only 10% of children hospitalized. The most common cause of pneumonia that seen were atypical infection (8.9%). The effectiveness of single blood culture in determining the etiology of pneumonia was very low and amounted to 0.6%. It is necessary to expand the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia upon the basis of molecular techniques and methods of serotyping.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum of spontaneously ruptured otitis media in the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Germany.
AB  - Otitis media is a common pediatric disease and the main reason for antibiotic prescription in children. Before implementation of routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination in Germany, serotypes contained in the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) were among the most frequent pneumococcal serotypes responsible for acute otitis media (AOM). This report describes the first 3 years of a prospective, multicenter, epidemiological cross-sectional study examining the bacteriology of middle ear fluids (MEF) and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) of children 2 months to 5 years of age with spontaneously perforated AOM in the era of routine pneumococcal vaccination. MEF was obtained from 963 subjects; NPS from 877. Reported case numbers steeply decreased over the three study years even though the recruiting base remained the same. Among subjects with relevant bacterial growth in their MEF swabs, 113 (11.7%) had Streptococcus pyogenes, 97 (10.1%) Staphylococcus aureus, 88 (9.1%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, 63 (6.5%) Haemophilus influenzae, and 8 (0.8%) Moraxella catarrhalis. S. pneumoniae isolates decreased from 41 (9.3%) in year 1 to 12 (5.7%) in year 3 (p = 0.128). PCV7 serotypes accounted for only 7.9% (n = 7) of isolated pneumococci. Of the 877 subjects with NPS cultures, 465 (53.0%) carried S. pneumoniae, 314 (35.8%) H. influenzae, 292 (33.3%) M. catarrhalis, and 110 (12.5%) S. pyogenes; 79.4% (n = 765) of the children were vaccinated with at least one dose of PCV. Carriage of pneumococci was slightly lower in vaccinated (47.8%) than in unvaccinated (52.7%) children (p = 0.254). PCV7 serotypes were carried by 9.6% of unvaccinated children but by only 4.2% of vaccinated children, resulting in a 56.3% vaccine effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Following universal PCV7 immunization, a clear epidemiological impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was observed as PCV7 serotypes have almost disappeared among AOM.
TI  - A prospective, observational, epidemiological evaluation of the aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of acute otitis media in Saudi children younger than 5years of age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information regarding acute otitis media (AOM) aetiology is important for developing effective vaccines. Here, bacterial aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of AOM were determined in young Saudi children. METHODS: Children aged 3-60months with a new episode of AOM, who had not received antibiotics or had received antibiotics for 48-72h but remained symptomatic, were enrolled in this prospective, observational, epidemiological study in Riyadh. Middle ear fluid (MEF) samples were collected by tympanocentesis or from spontaneous otorrhea, and tested for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the identified pathogens was assessed using E-tests. RESULTS: Between June 2009 and May 2011, 66 children were enrolled. S. pneumoniae was detected in 6 episodes and non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) in 8 episodes. Moreover, Staphylococcus aureus, which is an uncommon cause of AOM, was detected in 17 episodes. Pneumococcal serotypes were 7F (n=2), 23F (n=2), 19F (n=1) and 15F (n=1). Susceptibility to cefotaxime was observed in all pneumococcal and H. influenzae isolates, to cefuroxime in 4/6 pneumococcal and 8/8 H. influenzae isolates, and to penicillin in 5/6 pneumococcal isolates. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae and NTHi were major bacterial contributors for AOM in Saudi children.
TI  - Vaccination against the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes prevents death after  influenza virus: S. pyogenes super-infection.
AB  - Influenza virus infections are associated with a significant number of illnesses  and deaths on an annual basis. Many of the deaths are due to complications from secondary bacterial invaders, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The beta-hemolytic bacteria S. pyogenes colonizes both skin and respiratory surfaces, and frequently presents clinically as strep throat or impetigo. However, when these bacteria gain access to normally sterile sites, they can cause deadly diseases including sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and pneumonia. We previously developed a model of influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection, which we used to demonstrate that vaccination against influenza virus can limit deaths associated with a secondary bacterial infection, but this protection was not complete. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a vaccine that targets the M protein of S. pyogenes to determine whether immunity toward the bacteria alone would allow the host to survive an influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection. Our data demonstrate that vaccination against the M protein induces IgG antibodies, in particular those of the IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, and that these antibodies can interact with macrophages. Ultimately, this vaccine-induced immunity eliminated death within our influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection model, despite the fact that all M protein-vaccinated mice showed signs of illness following influenza virus inoculation. These findings identify immunity against bacteria as an important component of protection against influenza virus:bacteria super-infection.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children under 15 years of age in Southern Israel following  the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: a 4-year retrospective study (2009-2012).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiologic, microbiologic, clinical and therapeutic aspects of acute mastoiditis (AM) in children <15 years of age during the 4-year period (2009-2012) following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Israel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of all children with a discharge diagnosis of AM were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 66 AM episodes occurred in 61 patients. Forty-four (66.6%) cases occurred among patients <4 years, recent acute otitis media (AOM) history was reported in 27.1% and 28.8% patients received previous antibiotics for AOM. Postauricular swelling, postauricular sensitivity, protrusion of auricle and postauricular edema (93.8%, 90.6%, 85.9% and 95.7%, respectively) were the most common signs of AM. Leukocytosis >15,000 WBC/mm(3) was found in 39 (59.1%) cases. Cultures were performed in 52/66 episodes (positive in 27, 51.92% episodes), with recovery of 32 pathogens. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15/52, 28.85%), Streptococcus pyogenes (9, 17.3%) and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (5, 9.62%). Eight (53.3%) S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin. Mean incidence of overall and pneumococcal AM were 11.1 and 2.58 cases/100000, with no significant changes during the study years. Surgical intervention was required in 19 (28.8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: (1) AM occurs frequently in patients without previous AOM history and with no previous antibiotic treatment; (2) S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes continued to be the main etiologic agents of AM during the postvaccination period; (3) No changes were recorded in overall AM incidence and in pneumococcal AM incidence during the postvaccination period.
TI  - Tn5253 family integrative and conjugative elements carrying mef(I) and catQ determinants in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The linkage between the macrolide efflux gene mef(I) and the chloramphenicol inactivation gene catQ was first described in Streptococcus pneumoniae (strain Spn529), where the two genes are located in a module designated IQ element. Subsequently, two different defective IQ elements were detected in Streptococcus pyogenes (strains Spy029 and Spy005). The genetic elements carrying the three IQ elements were characterized, and all were found to be Tn5253 family integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). The ICE from S. pneumoniae (ICESpn529IQ) was sequenced, whereas the ICEs from S. pyogenes (ICESpy029IQ and ICESpy005IQ, the first Tn5253-like ICEs reported in this species) were characterized by PCR mapping, partial sequencing, and restriction analysis. ICESpn529IQ and ICESpy029IQ were found to share the intSp 23FST81 integrase gene and an identical Tn916 fragment, whereas ICESpy005IQ has int5252 and lacks Tn916. All three ICEs were found to lack the linearized pC194 plasmid that is usually associated with Tn5253-like ICEs, and all displayed a single copy of a toxin-antitoxin operon that is typically contained in the direct repeats flanking the excisable pC194 region when this region is present. Two different insertion sites of the IQ elements were detected, one in ICESpn529IQ and ICESpy029IQ, and another in ICESpy005IQ. The chromosomal integration of the three ICEs was site specific, depending on the integrase (intSp 23FST81 or int5252). Only ICESpy005IQ was excised in circular form and transferred by conjugation. By transformation, mef(I) and catQ were cotransferred at a high frequency from S. pyogenes Spy005 and at very low frequencies from S. pneumoniae Spn529 and S. pyogenes Spy029.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides are highly abundant and active in postoperative pleural drainage fluids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human lung is considered a nonsterile organ, and surgical interventions therefore take place in a more or less contaminated operating field. Nevertheless, infectious complications of the pleural cavity are low after major lung resections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the innate immunity and display a broad capacity to kill pathogens. We hypothesized that the pleural space must have a high natural antimicrobial barrier and that AMPs might effectively protect the pleural cavity. METHODS: Pleural effusions were collected after lung operations. Antimicrobial activity of the fluids against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was analyzed by microdilution assays. AMPs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemical analysis. The impact of proinflammatory triggers on AMP release from pleural mesothelial cells was evaluated. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity assays revealed high bactericidal properties of postoperative pleural drainage fluids. They effectively killed gram-negative pathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as gram-positive pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes). A variety of AMPs was detected at constantly high concentrations in the pleural fluids. They mainly derived from leukocytes and pleural epithelium. Although proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in the postoperative pleural fluids, AMP expression could not be augmented by Toll-like receptor (TLR) triggering or by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first evidence of a high abundance of AMPs in postoperative pleural fluids. Our findings might explain the broad protection against infectious complications of the pleural space after major lung operations.
TI  - Subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Camels migrate between the open boundaries of Sudan and Egypt either for grazing or for slaughtering. Bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. This study investigated whether camels slaughtered in Cairo carried pulmonary infections. METHODOLOGY: Five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. RESULTS: A total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including Staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), Escherichia coli (27.14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), Bacillus spp. (25.72%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%), Corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), Pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). Some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. Histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. Immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. Thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. If adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.
TI  - Relative quantitation of glycopeptides based on stable isotope labeling using MALDI-TOF MS.
AB  - We have developed an effective, sensitive method for quantitative glycopeptide profiling using stable isotope labeling and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). In this study, we synthesized benzoic acid-d0 N-succinimidyl ester (BzOSu) and benzoic acid-d5 N-succinimidyl ester (d-BzOSu) as light and heavy isotope reagents for stable isotope quantification for the comparative analysis of glycopeptides. Using this approach provided enhanced ionization efficiency in both positive and negative modes by MALDI-TOF MS. These reagents were quantitatively reacted with glycopeptides from human serum IgG (hIgG) at a wide range of concentrations; the labeling efficiency of the glycopeptides showed high reproducibility and a good calibration curve was obtained. To demonstrate the practical utility of this approach, we characterized the structures of glycopeptides from hIgG and from IgG1 produced by myeloma plasma. The glycopeptides were quantitatively analyzed by mixing Bz-labeled IgG1 glycopeptides with d-Bz-labeled hIgG glycopeptides. Glycan structural identification of the hIgG glycopeptides was demonstrated by combining the highly specific recognition of endo-beta-N-acetyl glucosaminidases from Streptococcus pyogenes (endoS) or from Streptococcus pneumoniae (endo-D) with MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The obtained data revealed the glycan profile and the ratio of glycan structural isomers containing a galactosylated extension on IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 glycopetides.
TI  - Subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. A small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. This review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. Understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.
TI  - Susceptibility of common bacterial respiratory pathogens to antimicrobial agents  in outpatients from South Backa District.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute infections of the upper respiratory tract are the most common reasons why patients visit general practitioners. Overuse of antibiotics in treatment of these conditions is extremely common practice although these infections are most frequently caused by viruses. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and susceptibility of common pathogens to antimicrobial agents that cause infections of the upper respiratory tract in outpatients and to determine whether the results obtained from the examined sample were in accordance with the recommendations of the current National Guideline. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 945 strains isolated from the throat and nasal swabs from January 1st to March 31st, 2008, as well as from 330 strains isolated from January 1st to March 31st, 2013 in South Backa District, Serbia. Susceptibility tests were performed by the standard disc diffusion method and according to the criteria recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: The most commonly isolated strains were Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branchamella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Branchamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae to examined antibiotics did not substantially change over the two study periods. None of the isolates of Staphylococcus aures demonstrated resistance to methicillin in 2008, while the percentage of resistant strains was 5.93% in 2013. Susceptibility rates of Staphylococcus pneumoniae isolates to erythromycin and clindamycin were lower in 2013 than in 2008. CONCLUSION: The investigation results follow the recommendations of the National Guideline for the usage of natural penicillin in the treatment of tonsillopharyngitis. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is recommended for the treatment of rhinosinusitis, and second generation cephalosporins are the second choice.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in Thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) are considered major causes of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM) worldwide, but data from Asia on primary causes of AOM are limited. This tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study assessed bacterial etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of AOM in Thailand. METHODS: Children 3 to 59 months presenting with AOM (< 72 hours of onset) who had not received prescribed antibiotics, or subjects who received prescribed antibiotics but remained symptomatic after 48-72 hours (treatment failures), were eligible. Study visits were conducted from April 2008 to August 2009. Bacteria were identified from middle ear fluid collected by tympanocentesis or spontaneous otorrhea swab sampling (< 20% of cases). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae serotypes were determined and antimicrobial resistance was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 123 enrolled children, 112 were included in analysis and 48% of the 118 samples were positive for S. pneumoniae (23% (27/118)), H. influenzae (18% (21/118)), Moraxella catarrhalis (6% (7/118)) or Streptococcus pyogenes (3% (4/118)). The most common pneumococcal serotypes were 19F (26%) and 14 (22%). The majority of H. influenzae isolates were encapsulated (18/21), with 13 type b (Hib) representing 62% of all H. influenzae isolate or 11% of all samples (13/118), and there were only 3 non-typeable isolates. Despite high antibiotic resistance, amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility was high. No pneumococcal vaccine use was reported. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, both frequently antibiotic resistant, were leading causes of bacterial AOM and there was an unexpectedly high burden of Hib in this population unvaccinated by any Hib conjugate vaccine. Conjugate vaccines effective against pneumococcus and H. influenzae could potentially reduce the burden of AOM in this population.
TI  - Establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Final rule.
AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. This final rule implements a provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). GAIN is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. Based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' Acinetobacter species, Aspergillus species, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Campylobacter species, Candida species, Clostridium difficile, Coccidioides species, Cryptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), Enterococcus species, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. The preamble to the proposed rule described the factors the Agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. As described in the preamble of this final rule, FDA applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.
TI  - Risk factors for carriage of AOM pathogens during the first 3 years of life in children with early onset of acute otitis media.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Risk factors associated with increased carriage rates are the same in children with recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) as in healthy children. These are also known to be risk factors for the development of AOM itself. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe risk factors for nasopharyngeal carriage in a cohort of young children at high risk of developing rAOM. METHODS: Children with an onset of AOM before 6 months of age, indicating an 80% risk of developing rAOM, were enrolled in a vaccination trial on heptavalent PCV. These children were monitored for 3 years during healthy and AOM periods with nasopharyngeal cultures, physical examinations, and questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 109 children were included at a mean age of 5 months; 105 were followed for 3 years, 89 (82%) of whom developed rAOM. Risk factors associated with increased carriage of all major AOM pathogens were age <2 years, concurrent AOM, and fulfilment of rAOM criteria. Having siblings in day care was associated with increased carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, recent antibiotic treatment was associated with H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage, and winter season was associated with M. catarrhalis carriage alone.
TI  - Trends in macrolide resistance of respiratory tract pathogens in the paediatric population in Serbia from 2004 to 2009.
AB  - We report the first study of macrolide resistance in respiratory tract pathogens  in a Serbian paediatric population. It included 5293 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4297 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2568 Moraxella catarrhalis and 1998 Haemophilus influenzae isolates derived from the respiratory tract and 110 invasive isolates from children aged up to 18 years during 2004-2009. Over the 6-year period, a significant increase (P < 0.01) in macrolide resistance was found in both S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes that reached 45% and 19%, respectively, in 2009. In the same period, consumption of macrolides increased continually from 2.46 to 5.8 defined daily dose/1000 inhabitants per day. The increase in macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes correlated with consumption of total macrolide and long-acting macrolides (r = 0.879, P = 0.05 and r = 0.922, P = 0.026, respectively). A similar trend was observed in pneumoccoci, although it did not reach statistical significance. The growing problem of macrolide resistance in pneumococci and S. pyogenes in Serbia requires further vigilant surveillance.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Severe acute otitis media caused by mucoid Streptococcus pyogenes in a previously healthy adult.
AB  - Streptococcus (S.) pyogenes is well recognized as the most common pathogen causing pharyngotonsillitis in school-age children. In Japan, mucoid Streptococcus pneumoniae is well known as a causative agent of severe acute otitis media (AOM); however, mucoid S. pyogenes has rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an AOM patient caused by mucoid S. pyogenes in Japan. A 36-year-old previously healthy female was referred to our hospital with suspicion of cerebrospinal otorrhea due to increasing otalgia accompanied by headache following myringotomy. Bacterial cultures of middle ear secretions were performed, and mucoid-form colonies surrounded by zones of complete beta-hemolysis were produced on sheep's blood agar. Antigen-agglutination test results were positive for S. pyogenes, and thus the patient received treatment with panipenem-betamipron 2.0 g/day for 10 days, which resolved nearly all symptoms. The bacteriological features of this strain were then investigated. The M-protein genotype encoded by the emm gene, the major virulence factor of S. pyogenes, was determined to be emm75. Generally, S. pyogenes forms colonies having non-mucoid matt appearances based on beta-hemolysis of sheep's blood agar. The mucoid phenotype results from abundant production of hyaluronic acid capsular polysaccharide, a key virulence determinant. emm75 is common in noninvasive, but less common in invasive disease. In conclusion, mucoid S. pyogenes can cause severe infection even in previously healthy persons. Emergence of mucoid S. pyogenes and drug resistance trends should be monitored in the future.
TI  - Relevance of the two-component sensor protein CiaH to acid and oxidative stress responses in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The production of virulence proteins depends on environmental factors, and two-component regulatory systems are involved in sensing these factors. We previously established knockout strains in all suspected two-component regulatory sensor proteins of the emm1 clinical strain of S. pyogenes and examined their relevance to acid stimuli in a natural atmosphere. In the present study, their relevance to acid stimuli was re-examined in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. RESULTS: The spy1236 (which is identical to ciaHpy) sensor knockout strain showed significant growth reduction compared with the parental strain in broth at pH 6.0, suggesting that the Spy1236 (CiaHpy) two-component sensor protein is involved in acid response of S. pyogenes. CiaH is also conserved in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and it has been reported that deletion of the gene for its cognate response regulator (ciaRpn) made the pneumococcal strains more sensitive to oxidative stress. In this report, we show that the spy1236 knockout mutant of S. pyogenes is more sensitive to oxidative stress than the parental strain. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the two-component sensor protein CiaH is involved in stress responses in S. pyogenes.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - [Brain abscess caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as a complication of acute otitis media in 7-year-old girl - a case report].
AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most commonly diagnosed childhood disease, especially in infants and preschool children. Onset of AOM encourage frequent upper respiratory infections and debilitating conditions that cause nasal patency and trumpets auditory dysfunction. Complications of AOM currently are rare. We present a case of complications of acute otitis media in form of acute cerebral abscess in a 7-year-old previously healthy girl.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - Factors that cause trimethoprim resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The use of trimethoprim in treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections has long been discouraged because it has been widely believed that this pathogen is resistant to this antibiotic. To gain more insight into the extent and molecular basis of trimethoprim resistance in S. pyogenes, we tested isolates from India and Germany and sought the factors that conferred the resistance. Resistant isolates were identified in tests for trimethoprim or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) susceptibility. Resistant isolates were screened for the known horizontally transferable trimethoprim-insensitive dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) genes dfrG, dfrF, dfrA, dfrD, and dfrK. The nucleotide sequence of the intrinsic dfr gene was determined for resistant isolates lacking the horizontally transferable genes. Based on tentative criteria, 69 out of 268 isolates (25.7%) from India were resistant to trimethoprim. Occurring in 42 of the 69 resistant isolates (60.9%), dfrF appeared more frequently than dfrG (23 isolates; 33.3%) in India. The dfrF gene was also present in a collection of SXT-resistant isolates from Germany, in which it was the only detected trimethoprim resistance factor. The dfrF gene caused resistance in 4 out of 5 trimethoprim-resistant isolates from the German collection. An amino acid substitution in the intrinsic dihydrofolate reductase known from trimethoprim-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae conferred resistance to S. pyogenes isolates of emm type 102.2, which lacked other aforementioned dfr genes. Trimethoprim may be more useful in treatment of S. pyogenes infections than previously thought. However, the factors described herein may lead to the rapid development and spread of resistance of S. pyogenes to this antibiotic agent.
TI  - Cardiopulmonary morbidity of streptococcal infections in a PICU.
AB  - AIM: The streptococci are important bacteria that cause serious childhood infections. We investigated cardiopulmonary morbidity associated with streptococcal infection and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. METHODS: A retrospective study between 2002 and 2013 of all children with a laboratory isolation of streptococcus. RESULTS: There were 40 (2.3%) PICU patients with streptococcal isolations including Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS, n = 7), Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS, n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP, n = 20), alpha-hemolytic (n = 4), beta-hemolytic (n = 2) and gama-hemolytic (n = 2) streptococci. Comparing among GAS, GBS and SP, respiratory isolates were more likely positive for GAS or SP (P = 0.033), whereas cerebrospinal fluid was more likely positive for GBS (P = 0.002). All GAS and GBS, and the majority of SP (90%) were sensitive to penicillin. All SP specimens were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. These infections were associated with high PICU mortality of 43%, 20% and 25%, respectively. Isolation of streptococci was associated with a 30% mortality and high rates of need for mechanical ventilatory and inotropic supports. Patients with GAS, SP or any streptococcal isolation had relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI), P value] of PICU deaths of 7.5 (CI 3.1-18.1, P < 0.0001), 4.5 (CI 2.0-9.8, P < 0.0002) and 5.7 (CI 3.4-9.5, P < 0.0001), respectively. In SP, older children had significantly higher prevalence of premorbid conditions such as malignancy, mental retardation/cerebral palsy +/- seizure disorders, chromosomal or genetic disorders (P = 0.003) than children <5 years of age. Serotypes were available for some of these specimens that included 19A, 6B, 3 and 6C. There were four SP deaths with multiorgan system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome (two 19A and two serotype 3). CONCLUSIONS: Severe streptococcal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite treatment with systemic antibiotics and intensive care unit support. GAS and SP affect the lungs of children, whereas GBS more likely causes meningitis in infants. The expanded coverage of newer polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines can probably prevent infections by serotypes 19A, 19F, 6B and 3.
TI  - Biofilm formation enhances fomite survival of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Both Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae are widely thought to rapidly die outside the human host, losing infectivity following desiccation in the environment. However, to date, all literature investigating the infectivity of desiccated streptococci has used broth-grown, planktonic populations. In this study, we examined the impact of biofilm formation on environmental survival of clinical and laboratory isolates of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae as both organisms are thought to colonize the human host as biofilms. Results clearly demonstrate that while planktonic cells that are desiccated rapidly lose viability both on hands and abiotic surfaces, such as plastic, biofilm bacteria remain viable over extended periods of time outside the host and remain infectious in a murine colonization model. To explore the level and extent of streptococcal fomite contamination that children might be exposed to naturally, direct bacteriologic cultures of items in a day care center were conducted, which demonstrated high levels of viable streptococci of both species. These findings raise the possibility that streptococci may survive in the environment and be transferred from person to person via fomites contaminated with oropharyngeal secretions containing biofilm streptococci.
TI  - [Antibiotherapy of severe ENT infections in children: complicated sinusitis].
AB  - Intra or extra orbital cellulitis or abscesses are the most frequent bacterial complications of acute sinusitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and anaerobic bacteria are predominant, and more rarelyHaemophilus influenzae (especially since vaccination against type b). Because of bacterial sensitivity, PK/PD parameters of antibiotics, and depending on the classification of Chandler, different probabilistic regimens may be proposed: In class 1 by Chandler (preseptal cellulitis), amoxicillinclavulinate (80 mg/kg/d) in 2 oral doses, and ceftriaxone in intramuscular injection; in cases of class 2 to 5 by Chandler, high doses of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulinate (until 150 mg/kg/d of amoxicillin), or intravenous association of ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/d) or cefotaxim (200 mg/kg/d), with anti-anaerobic like metronidazole (30 mg/kg/d) or clindamycine (40 mg/kg/d).
TI  - [Antibiotherapy of severe ENT infections in children: propositions of the French  Group of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (PID) of the French Society of Pediatrics].
AB  - The French Group of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (PID) of the French Society of  Pediatrics found necessary to issue in 2011 therapeutic proposals concerning antibiotic treatment in severe ENT infections in children (acute mastoiditis, severe sinusitis, peripharyngeal abscess). They took into account, for each clinical situation, published studies and existing guidelines, the most frequently encountered bacterial species, their usual sensitivity to antibiotics, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characteristics. These propositions aim to ensure the proper use of antibiotics and to limit the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics by minimizing the use of broadspectrum molecules, especially cephalosporins and penems. These infections are often multi microbial and respond to aerobic flora similar to that found in non severe community acquired ENT infections and soft tissue infections ( Streptococcus pyogenes or group A Streptococcus(GAS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae). Anaerobic flora may be associated and implicated in some situations. In most cases, high-dosage of amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid offers the best PK/PD profile and allows to avoid the overuse of injectable third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - The prevalence of bacteremia in pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia: guidelines to reduce the frequency of obtaining blood cultures.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacteremia in pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at our institution and to test the effectiveness of newly developed guidelines for obtaining blood cultures. METHODS: Using recent literature and local expert opinion, institutional guidelines for obtaining blood cultures in pediatric patients with CAP were developed. A retrospective chart review of children treated in the emergency department or admitted for CAP from January 2010 through June 2011 was conducted. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including results of blood cultures. Chi2 tests assessed for variables associated with bacteremia, whether a blood culture was obtained, and if the decision to obtain a culture was appropriate based on our guidelines. RESULTS: The study included 330 patients; 155 (47%) blood cultures were obtained in our patient population. Five cultures were true-positive findings, making the prevalence of bacteremia 3.2% in patients with blood cultures and 1.5% in all patients. All 5 true positive results met criteria for blood culture based on our guidelines. Applying our guidelines retrospectively, the decision to obtain a blood culture met criteria in 55% of the cases. Bivariate analysis showed that patients discharged from the emergency department had higher rates of guideline-appropriate decisions than patients admitted. Radiographic findings were associated with making a guideline-appropriate decision regarding blood culture. CONCLUSIONS: Instituting local guidelines that limit the frequency of obtaining blood cultures in pediatric patients with CAP is likely to capture any patient with bacteremia. This study suggests that blood cultures may not need to be routinely obtained in all patients admitted to the hospital with CAP.
TI  - [The frequency of bacteria in human gallstones].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complications caused by lost gallstones within the abdominal cavity are well known. Abscesses, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract were all described in the literature, but gallstones were found in hernial sac, or even in sputum after it penetrated through the diaphragm into the respiratory tract. These complications can develop between several weeks to several years postoperatively. Most complications can be treated surgically only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty gallstones and bile samples were collected from 50 patients who underwent cholecystectomy (36 female / 14 male, avarge age: 60.8 +/- 6.8 years). All samples were sent for microbiological examination. RESULTS: bacterial colonization of the gallstone and the bile were found in 16 cases. Four of them showed acute inflammation in the gallbladder while pathological signs of chronic inflammation in the gallbladder wall were detected in eight cases. Empyema was found in four cases. Bacteria from enteral origin (Esherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae) was detected in 13 cases, while non-enteral (Klebsiella penumoniae, Streptococcus alfa-haemoliticus) colony were detected in three cases. Positive bacterial cultures were identified in twelve female and fourmale patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of bacteria can be found in the gallstones, which may cause various complications.
TI  - Crystal structure of PfbA, a surface adhesin of Streptococcus pneumoniae, provides hints into its interaction with fibronectin.
AB  - PfbA is a surface adhesin and invasin of Streptococcus pneumoniae that binds to human fibronectin and plasminogen of the host extracellular matrix. It is a virulence factor for its pathogenesis. The crystal structure of recombinant PfbA150-607 from S. pneumoniae strain R6, was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method and refined to 1.90A resolution. The structure of rPfbA150-607 revealed that residues Thr150 to Lys570 form a rigid parallel beta helix, followed by a short disordered region (571-607) that consists of beta hairpins. The structural organization of the beta helix resembles that of polysaccharide-modifying enzymes. The structural and sequence features essential for fibronectin-binding observed in the well characterized fibronectin-binding proteins such as FnBPA of Staphylococcus aureus, SfbI of Streptococcus pyogenes and BBK32 of Borrelia burgdorferi has been found in rPfbA150-607. Based on this, it is predicted that the disordered region following the beta helix could be the fibronectin-binding region in PfbA. PfbA150-607 contains relatively high number of surface exposed lysines and these residues are probably involved in binding plasmin(ogen) as observed in other plasminogen-binding proteins.
TI  - Uncommon cause of severe pneumonia: co-infection of influenza B and Streptococcus.
AB  - Influenza and pneumococcus co-infection can cause severe morbidity and mortality. Usually, this entails influenza A, while infection by influenza B is rarely serious. The literature describes influenza A epidemics leading to prolific loss of lives, notably the 1918 epidemic was blamed for the deaths of 40 to 50 million people. In this report, four patients were infected by influenza B during the influenza epidemic of 2011/12 in Hong Kong. All of them were previously healthy and had no chronic diseases; they were admitted to the hospital due to influenza-like symptoms. They rapidly deteriorated with multi-organ failure, and were subsequently diagnosed to be infected with influenza B and streptococci that gave rise to severe pneumonia. Three of them were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae and one with Streptococcus pyogenes. All of them had leukopenia, septic shock, and acute kidney injury; two of whom died despite aggressive antibiotic treatment and organ support in the intensive care unit. According to the literature, this is the second case report of severe invasive pneumococcal pneumonia secondary to influenza B infection.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of integrative conjugative element Tn5253 of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Conjugative transposon Tn5253, an integrative conjugative element (ICE) of Streptococcus pneumoniae carrying the cat and tet(M) genes, was shown to be 64,528 bp in size and to contain 79 open reading frames, of which only 38 could be annotated. Two distinct genetic elements were found integrated into Tn5253: Tn5251 (18,033 bp), of the Tn916-Tn1545 family of ICEs, and Omegacat(pC194) (7,627 bp), which could not conjugate but was capable of intracellular mobility by excision, circularization, and integration by homologous recombination. The highest conjugation frequency of Tn5253 was observed when Streptococcus pyogenes was the donor (6.7 x 10(-3) transconjugants/donor).
TI  - Changes in acute mastoiditis in a single pediatric tertiary medical center: our experience during 2008-2009 compared with data for 1983-2007.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess clinical reports and bacteriological changes over a 25-y period in children with acute mastoiditis. METHODS: The medical files of all children with a discharge diagnosis of mastoiditis, hospitalized in a tertiary pediatric medical center over a 2-y period (2008-2009), were reviewed and compared to previously published data from the same center for the y 1983-1985, 1993-1995, and 2003-2007. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four children (143 episodes) with acute mastoiditis were identified during 2008-2009; 81% had fever, 95% auricular displacement, and 80% post-auricular swelling. Forty-nine children were diagnosed with acute otitis media and had been treated with antibiotics prior to hospitalization. However, 22% showed no clinical symptoms preceding ear protrusion. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in 32%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 20%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13%, and Haemophilus influenzae in 10% of cases. From 1990 to 2005, the incidence of S. pyogenes isolation increased from approximately 5% to 20%. During this period, the number of cases increased from 8-20 to 67 per y. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes has emerged as a significant pathogen. We found that acute mastoiditis may appear without preceding symptoms in approximately 22% of cases.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity for clinical isolates from pediatric patients of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1: 14) -outcomes of special drug use investigation on antibacterial activity (annual changes)].
AB  - As a special drug use investigation, we monitored and assessed trends in antibacterial activity of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1:14) (hereafter, "CVA/AMPC (1:14)") and other antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates from pediatric patients with otitis media or respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis isolated and identified from otorrhea, epipharynx and rhinorrhea of pediatric patients with otitis media, the MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) in five years between 2006-2010 were 1 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae and 8 microg/mL for H. influenzae and 0.25-0.5microg/mL for M catarrhalis. The changes of MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase non-producing H. influenzae were two times, and no decrease in drug susceptibility was found in the period of the present investigation. In addition, the MIC changes of other antimicrobial agents for these three organisms were approximately two to four times as well. Against organisms isolated and identified from pus, sputum, pharynx, skin and urine of pediatric patients with respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections, the MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) in four years between 2008-2011 were 1 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae, < or =0.06microg/mL for penicillin susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) without any change, 0.5-1 microg/mL for penicillin intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) with a twofold change and 1 microg/mL for PRSP with no change. The MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) were 2-8 microg/mL for S. aureus with a fourfold change, 2 microg/mL for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus without any change, 4-8 microg/mL for H. influenzae with a twofold change. Against beta-lactamase non-producing H. influenzae, MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) were 1 microg/mL for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin susceptible (BLNAS), 8 microg/mL for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant (BLNAR), showing no change. Neither Streptococcus pyogenes or Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated any change and M. catarrhalis and Escherichia coli showed twofold changes of MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1: 14). In the present investigation conducted to monitor annual changes in antibacterial activity intended for pediatric patients with otitis media or other infections, there was no significant change in antibacterial activity of CVA/AMPC (1: 14).
TI  - [Group A streptococcal meningitis: Streptococcus pneumoniae is not the only one to seep into the CSF fluid leak!].
AB  - We reported a case of group A streptococcal meningitis in a patient with a CSF fluid leak. This case underlined several relevant points: (i) an unfrequent cause of bacterial meningitis; (ii) the main diagnosis to evoke when the direct examination of CSF shows Gram+ cocci with a negative pneumococcal antigen; (iii) that bacteria other than Streptococcus pneumoniae are possible in front of a meningitis associated with a CSF fluif leak.
TI  - Post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis associated with pneumococcal infection.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Described herein is the case of a 5-year-old girl with febrile post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis (PSAGN) associated with pneumococcal bacteremia. The chief complaints were fever and macrohematuria without respiratory symptoms. Urinalysis indicated a protein level of 3+. Serological data showed elevated anti-streptolysin O (ASO) and hypocomplementemia. Blood culture was positive for S. pneumoniae. Her acute renal failure was mild and improved over several days. Although PSAGN was confirmed by elevated ASO and transient hypocomplementemia, the clinical course was consistent with those of several reported cases of AGN associated with pneumococcal infection. To our knowledge, there have been few reports on the relationship between pneumococcal infection and the incidence of PSAGN. We suggest the hypothesis that pneumococcal infection itself could exaggerate the complement reaction leading to PSAGN. It is important to consider PSAGN associated with a microbial infection such as S. pneumoniae when faced with a febrile patient with AGN.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance and bacterial spectrum of infection in Gabon, Central Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physicians depend on reliable information on the local epidemiology of infection and antibiotic resistance rates to guide empiric treatment in critically ill patients. As these data are scarce for Central Africa, we performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from a secondary care hospital in Gabon. METHODS: Microbiological reports from 2009 to 2012 were used to assess the non-susceptibility rates of the three most common isolates from six major types of infections (bloodstream, ear-eye-nose-throat, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract and wound infection). RESULTS: A high diversity of pathogens was found, but Staphylococcus aureus was predominant in the majority of infections. Overall, the three most prevalent pathogens in children were S. aureus (33.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (8.1%) and Escherichia coli (4.5%) and in adults S. aureus (23.5%), E. coli (15.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%). In total, 5.8% (n = 19) of all S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae was 15.4% (n = 78), 49.4% of all K. pneumoniae were ESBL-producer (n = 42). CONCLUSION: The high diversity of potential pathogens and high resistance rates in Gram-negative bacteria challenge a rational empiric use of antibiotics. Countrywide continuous sentinel surveillance is therefore urgently needed.
TI  - Use of a modified fluorescent in situ hybridization procedure to improve the identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae in blood cultures.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important causative agent for bacteremia. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a helpful molecular technique for the rapid identification of S. pneumoniae in positive blood cultures. There are many reports concerning the application of an enzymatic treatment with lysozyme in the FISH procedure for partial cell wall digestion of S. pneumoniae. However, this study was aimed to test the FISH procedure without enzymatic treatment for the identification of S. pneumoniae in blood culture specimens. Seventy-seven positive blood culture specimens containing Gram-positive cocci were examined by both the conventional laboratory methods and FISH. Detection of S. pneumoniae was performed by two FISH procedures: one procedure was performed with an enzymatic treatment step and the other one was done without enzymatic treatment. In addition, the specimens were tested by the FISH procedure with enzymatic treatment to detect Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus. The specificity of FISH in comparison with conventional culture methods was 100%. The sensitivity of the FISH procedure with enzymatic treatment for the detection of S. pneumoniae was 90%, whereas, the sensitivity of the FISH procedure without enzymatic treatment was 100%. In fact, by omission of enzymatic treatment, detection of S. pneumoniae was improved in 6 specimens. The results of the FISH and culture methods for the detection of S. pyogenes and Enterococcus were compatible. Altogether, FISH procedure without enzymatic treatment step seems to improve the detection of S. pneumoniae in some cases. Thus, for successful detection of S. pneumoniae, we suggest the application of both FISH procedures (the procedure with enzymatic treatment and the procedure without enzymatic treatment) for each blood culture specimen.
TI  - [Microflora of palatine tonsils in chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - The objective of the present work was to develop the standardized approaches to pharmacotherapy of chronic tonsillitis based on the data of regional specificity of the tonsillar microflora. The methods of investigations included the study of throat swabs obtained from 668 patients presenting with various forms of chronic tonsillitis (CT). Half of these patients were shown to be infected with Streptococcus pyogenes and 24.5% with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The presence of concomitant pathology of the respiratory and digestive tracts in the patients with CT increases the probability of identification of enterobacteria, enteroccocci, and staphylococci in combination with streptococci and mycoplasmas. It is concluded that the choice of antibacterial therapy should be based on the results of analysis of the aggravated medical history and bacteriological diagnostics including the isolation of all putative pathogens and examination of their susceptinility to antibacterial agents.

TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Improving the lethal effect of cpl-7, a pneumococcal phage lysozyme with broad bactericidal activity, by inverting the net charge of its cell wall-binding module.
AB  - Phage endolysins are murein hydrolases that break the bacterial cell wall to provoke lysis and release of phage progeny. Recently, these enzymes have also been recognized as powerful and specific antibacterial agents when added exogenously. In the pneumococcal system, most cell wall associated murein hydrolases reported so far depend on choline for activity, and Cpl-7 lysozyme constitutes a remarkable exception. Here, we report the improvement of the killing activity of the Cpl-7 endolysin by inversion of the sign of the charge of the cell wall-binding module (from -14.93 to +3.0 at neutral pH). The engineered variant, Cpl-7S, has 15 amino acid substitutions and an improved lytic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiresistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, and other pathogens. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a single 25-mug dose of Cpl-7S significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish embryos infected with S. pneumoniae or S. pyogenes, confirming the killing effect of Cpl-7S in vivo. Interestingly, Cpl-7S, in combination with 0.01% carvacrol (an essential oil), was also found to efficiently kill Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, an effect not described previously. Our findings provide a strategy to improve the lytic activity of phage endolysins based on facilitating their pass through the negatively charged bacterial envelope, and thereby their interaction with the cell wall target, by modulating the net charge of the cell wall-binding modules.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in healthy preschool children during winter-spring months.
AB  - The paper aimed to determine the incidence of colonization of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis in the nasopharynges of healthy children in two preschool institutions during winter and spring months, without using antimicrobial treatment or serotyping of these bacteria. In addition to colonization of the above bacteria, the research that continued for 3 months monitored the length of their persistence in and disappearance from children's nasopharynges, children's health statuses, and provision of adequate medical interventions in children demonstrating clinical signs of disease. The ultimate aim of the paper was based on contributing to clearer and more accurate determination of a medical procedure in case of a positive result for bacteria intended to be found in the nasopharynx of a healthy child who spends time in a preschool institution.
TI  - Streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  - The role of Streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is considered to be of little relevance. We aimed to describe a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (SVO), to analyze the clinical features associated with different Streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with VO caused by Staphylococcus aureus. An incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of SVO (1991-2011) were performed. Statistical comparison of SVO by different species and between them and staphylococcal VO was carried out. Over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of VOs and SVOs per year (p <0.05). Among 58 cases of SVO, those caused by non-viridans streptococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked VO by S. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). In contrast, the latter have a sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis (p <0.05). Among non-viridans SVOs, concomitant infection was specifically related to S. pneumoniae (p <0.05). In conclusion, SVO presents a wide range of clinical patterns. The relationship between VO and diagnosis of endocarditis was established with SVO caused by the viridans group. Whereas non-viridans SVO mimics acute characteristics of VO caused by S. aureus, cases of viridans SVO are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. The increased incidence of SVO during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.
TI  - Combination of pantothenamides with vanin inhibitors as a novel antibiotic strategy against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The emergence of resistance against current antibiotics calls for the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases. Synthetic pantothenamides are pantothenate analogs that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro in minimal media. Pantothenamides were shown to be substrates of the bacterial coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway, causing cellular CoA depletion and interference with fatty acid synthesis. In spite of their potential use and selectivity for bacterial metabolic routes, these compounds have never made it to the clinic. In the present study, we show that pantothenamides are not active as antibiotics in the presence of serum, and we found that they were hydrolyzed by ubiquitous pantetheinases of the vanin family. To address this further, we synthesized a series of pantetheinase inhibitors based on a pantothenate scaffold that inhibited serum pantetheinase activity in the nanomolar range. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that addition of these pantetheinase inhibitors prevented hydrolysis of pantothenamides by serum. We found that combinations of these novel pantetheinase inhibitors and prototypic pantothenamides like N5-Pan and N7-Pan exerted antimicrobial activity in vitro, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) even in the presence of serum. These results indicate that pantothenamides, when protected against degradation by host pantetheinases, are potentially useful antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system.
AB  - The ability to artificially control transcription is essential both to the study  of gene function and to the construction of synthetic gene networks with desired properties. Cas9 is an RNA-guided double-stranded DNA nuclease that participates in the CRISPR-Cas immune defense against prokaryotic viruses. We describe the use of a Cas9 nuclease mutant that retains DNA-binding activity and can be engineered as a programmable transcription repressor by preventing the binding of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) to promoter sequences or as a transcription terminator by blocking the running RNAP. In addition, a fusion between the omega subunit of the RNAP and a Cas9 nuclease mutant directed to bind upstream promoter regions can achieve programmable transcription activation. The simple and efficient modulation of gene expression achieved by this technology is a useful asset for the study of gene networks and for the development of synthetic biology and biotechnological applications.
TI  - Clinical manifestations and microbiology of acute otitis media with spontaneous otorrhea in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE(S): In Taiwan, clinical and microbiological data on acute otitis media (AOM) with spontaneous otorrhea in children are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on children with AOM and spontaneous otorrhea between January 2011 and June 2012. Otorrhea samples were collected using sterile swabs and sent for cultures. Pathogens found were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Pneumococcal isolates collected from October 2011 to June 2012 were serotyped. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled in the study for demographic and microbiological analysis. Their median age was 2.5 years. After excluding those with lobar pneumonia, 84 patients were included for analysis of clinical manifestation. The mean febrile duration was 6 days. Leukocytosis and C-reactive protein (CRP) level >50 mg/L were noted in 29 (34.5%) patients and 38 (45.2%) patients, respectively. Patients with pneumococcal infection were older (p = 0.007) and had more severe symptoms [fever (p = 0.001), otalgia (p = 0.055), respiratory symptoms (p = 0.002-0.03), and higher CRP level (p = 0.015)] than children with other bacterial infection. Otorrhea cultures were obtained from 69 (75%) patients, of whom 52 had definitive AOM pathogens. The most common causative pathogen was S. pneumoniae (61.5%), followed by S. aureus (36.5%). Serotype 19A accounted for two-thirds of pneumococcal isolates and had a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (66.7%) and ceftriaxone (83.3%). CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae was found to be the most important source of AOM with spontaneous otorrhea in children and caused more severe symptoms. Serotype 19A, which was usually nonsusceptible to antimicrobial agents, was the most prevalent serotype in these patients.
TI  - Microbiology of bacteria causing recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) and AOM treatment failure in young children in Spain: shifting pathogens in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination era.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively identify the bacterial aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of problematic (recurrent and treatment failure) acute otitis media in Spanish children several years after the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. METHODS: Tympanocentesis or careful sampling of spontaneous otorrhoea was performed on children aged 3 to <36 months with recurrent acute otitis media, acute otitis media treatment failure or unresolved acute otitis media. RESULTS: 105 acute otitis media episodes (77 sampled by tympanocentesis, 28 otorrhoea samples) were evaluated: 46 recurrent, 35 treatment failures, 24 unresolved acute otitis media. 74 episodes (70.4%) had at least one bacterium identified on culture: Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 21 episodes, Haemophilus influenzae (all non-typeable) in 44, Streptococcus pyogenes in 2, Moraxella catarrhalis in 2. No statistically significant difference in bacterial aetiology by episode type was detected. Non-typeable H. influenzae was the most commonly isolated pathogen in all acute otitis media types and in all age sub-groups. Forty percent of S. pneumoniae isolates were multi-drug resistant. Pneumococcal serotype 19A was the most frequently identified serotype (7/21 episodes). Multi-drug resistance was found in 56% of 19A isolates. Of non-typeable H. influenzae isolates, 15% were ampicillin resistant and 13% were amoxicillin/clavulanate resistant. S. pneumoniae and non-typeable H. influenzae DNA were each detected in 57% of samples culture negative for these pathogens, including 12 co-infections. CONCLUSION: Combining culture and polymerase chain reaction results, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae may be implicated in 70% and 43% of clinically problematic bacterial acute otitis media episodes, respectively. The impact of new vaccines to prevent both S. pneumoniae and non-typeable H. influenzae acute otitis media may be substantial in this population and is worth investigating.
TI  - Antibody to a conserved antigenic target is protective against diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens.
AB  - Microbial capsular antigens are effective vaccines but are chemically and immunologically diverse, resulting in a major barrier to their use against multiple pathogens. A beta-(1-->6)-linked poly-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) surface capsule is synthesized by four proteins encoded in genetic loci designated intercellular adhesion in Staphylococcus aureus or polyglucosamine in selected Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We report that many microbial pathogens lacking an identifiable intercellular adhesion or polyglucosamine locus produce PNAG, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal pathogens, as well as protozoa, e.g., Trichomonas vaginalis, Plasmodium berghei, and sporozoites and blood-stage forms of Plasmodium falciparum. Natural antibody to PNAG is common in humans and animals and binds primarily to the highly acetylated glycoform of PNAG but is not protective against infection due to lack of deposition of complement opsonins. Polyclonal animal antibody raised to deacetylated glycoforms of PNAG and a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that both bind to native and deacetylated glycoforms of PNAG mediated complement-dependent opsonic or bactericidal killing and protected mice against local and/or systemic infections by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, Candida albicans, and P. berghei ANKA, and against colonic pathology in a model of infectious colitis. PNAG is also a capsular polysaccharide for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and nontypable Hemophilus influenzae, and protects cells from environmental stress. Vaccination targeting PNAG could contribute to immunity against serious and diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens, and the conserved production of PNAG suggests that it is a critical factor in microbial biology.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Platelets promote bacterial dissemination in a mouse model of streptococcal sepsis.
AB  - Platelets have been reported to contribute to inflammation and inflammatory disorders. In the present study, we demonstrate that platelets contribute to the acute response to bacterial infection in a mouse model of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Thrombocytopenia occurred rapidly in infected animals and this was associated with platelet activation, formation of platelet-neutrophil complexes and neutrophil activation. In order to assess the role of platelets during infection, platelets were depleted prior to infection. Platelet-depleted animals had significantly decreased platelet-neutrophil complex formation and neutrophil activation in response to infection. Importantly, significantly fewer bacteria disseminated to the blood, lungs, and spleen of platelet-depleted animals. Platelet-depleted animals did not decrease as significantly in weight as the infected control animals. The results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for platelets during the pathophysiological response to infection, whereby S. pyogenes bacteria bind to platelets and platelets facilitate bacterial dissemination.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  - Acute otitis media in infants younger than three months not vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The true incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in neonates and infants younger than three months is unknown. In this population organisms causing AOM may disseminate leading to bacteremia, sepsis, and meningitis [1]. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical presentation, associated severe infections, bacteriologic etiology, and antibiotic resistance patterns of organisms isolated from the middle ear of infants younger than three months that were not vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: Otomicroscopy was performed in all children to confirm the suspected diagnosis of AOM. When purulent effusion retained in the middle ear was diagnosed, tympanocentesis and culture of middle-ear fluid was performed by conventional methods. Serotyping was done using the Quellung technique. RESULTS: From May 2, 2009 to February 28, 2010, 52 infants met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six were male (69.2%) and 16 were female (30.8%). From these 52 patients, 76 samples were obtained for culture. Bilateral acute suppurative otitis media was diagnosed in 24 (46.2%) infants. Of all infants, 18 (34.6%) had been treated with antibiotics before tympanocentesis. Eight patients (44.4%) had negative middle-ear fluid cultures. Sixty bacterial pathogens were isolated from the middle-ear fluid of 43 patients. Mixed infections were recorded in 14/52 patients (26.9%). Nine cultures were negative (17.3%), of which eight were from patients that had previously been treated with antibiotics. S. pneumoniae was isolated from middle-ear aspirates of 26/52 (50%) patients with acute suppurative otitis media. Twenty-two out of the 26 isolates were susceptible (84.7%) and four were intermediately susceptible to penicillin (15.3%). Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated in 3/52 (5.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae in 18/52 patients (34.6%). Five (27.8%) of these were beta-lactamase producers. Blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine cultures were negative. Parenteral antimicrobial treatment was indicated in 29/52 (56%). CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae is the most frequent pathogen to cause AOM in this age group. Empirical treatment with amoxicillin or ceftriaxone should be considered depending on clinical suspicion of severe invasive infection.
TI  - Endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2012. Endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis. Cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. Clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and S aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. Treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). Two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. Systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). Seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Pneumococcal acute otitis media in infants and children in central Romania, 2009-2011: microbiological characteristics and potential coverage by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of pneumococcal acute otitis media (AOM) in children in Brasov, Central Romania, before the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) into the routine national immunization program. METHODS: All AOM patients aged <5 years who underwent tympanocentesis or presented with purulent otorrhea of </=24h duration during 2009-2011 were enrolled. RESULTS: Two hundred and twelve consecutive AOM patients had a middle ear fluid (MEF) culture performed; 99 (46.6%) episodes occurred in patients <12 months of age. One hundred and eleven (52.4%) episodes were culture-positive. Tympanocentesis was performed in 142 patients and spontaneous otorrhea cultures in 70 patients. Overall, 114 pathogens were recovered: Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolate (81 isolates, 70.3% of all culture-positive episodes), followed by non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (26, 20.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (5, 4.5%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (2, 1.8%). Antibiotic susceptibility and serotyping were performed for 48 (59.3%) S. pneumoniae isolates: 45 (93.8%) were non-susceptible to penicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) >/=2.0mug/ml in 24, 53.3%) and 37 (77.1%) isolates had ceftriaxone MIC values >/=0.5mug/ml (16 with MIC >2.0mug/ml). S. pneumoniae non-susceptibility rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and clindamycin were 75.0%, 58.3%, and 35.4%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Multidrug resistance was found in 33 (68.7%) isolates. The most common S. pneumoniae serotypes were 19F (14, 29.2%), 6B (8, 16.7%), 23F (8, 16.7%), and 14 (6, 12.5%). Serotype 19A was found in three (6.2%) patients and 6A in two (4.1%). Non-PCV13 serotypes represented six (12.6%) of all serotypes (four of them non-susceptible to penicillin). Thirty-six (75.0%) isolates were potentially covered by PCV7, 37 (77.0%) by PCV10, and 42 (87.5%) by PCV13. CONCLUSIONS: (1) S. pneumoniae was the most prevalent pathogen, with frequent antibiotic resistance and multi-resistance patterns; (2) most pneumococcal AOM and multidrug-resistant episodes could be prevented by PCVs.
TI  - Contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline HCL tested against Gram-positive pathogens: SENTRY Program results using CLSI and EUCAST breakpoint criteria.
AB  - Tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter spp. Also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), and regulatory-approved documents. We have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline HCL and minocycline when tested against contemporary Gram-positive pathogens. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline HCL activity via reference methods (M07-A9) using a worldwide collection of S. aureus (SA; 4917 strains with 1955 MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 1899), S. pyogenes (GRA; 246), and S. agalactiae (GRB; 217). Regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline HCL of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for MRSA/SPN/GRB/GRA, respectively. Lower EUCAST susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/mL) for GRA to -8.9% (</=1 mug/mL) for MRSA (97.2% susceptible by CLSI; 88.3% by EUCAST). Use of tetracycline HCL-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (CLSI) to 98.4% to 99.6% (EUCAST) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the CLSI breakpoints (14.7%) compared to EUCAST criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for MRSA testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. In conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline HCL when testing SA (especially MRSA) and pathogenic streptococci. When testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. We conclude that EUCAST breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/mL) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Inducible clindamycin resistance in beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to macrolides in beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae arises primarily due to Erm(B) or Mef(A). Erm(B) typically confers high level resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSB phenotype), whereas Mef(A) confers low level resistance to macrolides only (M phenotype). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of macrolide resistance mechanisms in isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci in Israel, with particular emphasis on inducible MLSB phenotype. METHODS: We collected 316 clinical isolates of streptococci during May-August 2010. Erythromycin resistance mechanism was determined by the erythromycin-clindamycin double disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates were 19.4% and 13.4% for S. pneumoniae, 4.7% and 1.6% for group A Streptococcus (GAS), 17% and 17% for group B Streptococcus (GBS), and 38.8% and 27.8% for group G Streptococcus (GGS) respectively. The most common resistance mechanism for all streptococci was constitutive MLSB (cMLSB). Inducible MLSs (iMLSB) mechanism was found in 3% of all strains and represented 25% of resistance mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance and the distribution of resistance mechanisms differ among beta-hemolytic streptococci and S. pneumoniae, with GBS, GGS and S. pneumoniae showing the highest resistance rate. Macrolide or lincosamide cannot be empirically used for severe streptococcal infections before strains are proved to be susceptible. Continuous surveillance of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance patterns among streptococci is needed.
TI  - Bone and joint infections.
AB  - An acute osteoarticular infection in a child is most often hematogenous. The infection manifests as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Medical advice is usually sought within 2 to 6 days from the onset of symptoms. A child with an osteomyelitis in a lower extremity characteristically presents with limping with or without notable local tenderness, whereas acute septic arthritis is often readily visible because the joint is red, tender, and swollen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment remain pivotal in avoiding complications in acute bacterial bone and joint infections.
TI  - Acute sinusitis in children.
AB  - Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the antibacterial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, GSK1322322.
AB  - GSK1322322 is a novel peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibitor being developed for the intravenous and oral treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The activity of GSK1322322 was tested against a global collection of clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2,370), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 115), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 947), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 617), and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 940), including strains resistant to one or more marketed antibiotics. GSK1322322 had an MIC(90) of 1 mug/ml against M. catarrhalis and 4 mug/ml against H. influenzae, with 88.8% of beta-lactamase-positive strains showing growth inhibition at that concentration. All S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited by </= 4 mug/ml of GSK1322322, with an MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml. Pre-existing resistance mechanisms did not affect its potency, as evidenced by the MIC(90) of 1 mug/ml for penicillin, levofloxacin, and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. GSK1322322 was very potent against S. pyogenes strains, with an MIC(90) of 0.5 mug/ml, irrespective of their macrolide resistance phenotype. This PDF inhibitor was also active against S. aureus strains regardless of their susceptibility to methicillin, macrolides, or levofloxacin, with an MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml in all cases. Time-kill studies showed that GSK1322322 had bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus, demonstrating a >/= 3-log(10) decrease in the number of CFU/ml at 4x MIC within 24 h in 29 of the 33 strains tested. Given the antibacterial potency demonstrated against this panel of organisms, GSK1322322 represents a valuable alternative therapy for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of bactericidal silver nanoparticles using cultural filtrate of simulated microgravity grown Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by biological method using cultural filtrate of Klebsiella pneumoniae cultured under simulated microgravity and silver nitrate solution as precursor. The nanoparticles exhibited typical plasmon absorption maximum of silver nanoparticles between 405 and 407 nm. Spherical silver nanoparticles were found to have size between 15 and 37 nm by TEM analysis. XRD pattern corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220) (311) revealed the crystalline nature of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles. FTIR spectrum proposed stabilization of silver nanoparticles by the protein molecules present in the cultural filtrate. The silver nanoparticles exhibited high bactericidal activity against Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and moderate bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Diospyros bipindensis (Gurke) extracts and its main constituents.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diospyros bipindensis (Gurke) stem bark is used in Cameroon by Baka Pygmies for the treatment of respiratory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of constituents from the bark extracts through bioassay-guided fractionation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity of extracts, fractions and pure compounds was assessed through the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory mediator nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity and nitric oxide (NO) production. DPPH, ABTS and ORAC assays were used for determining the antioxidant properties. The activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) by the macrodilution method. RESULTS: The water extract showed antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC: 300 mug/ml) and S. pyogenes (MIC: 300 mug/ml). The dichloromethane extract efficiently inhibited NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and NO production and exhibited significant antioxidant activity in the ORAC assay. An interesting activity was also found against S. pneumoniae (MIC: 200 mug/ml), S. aureus (MIC: 400 mug/ml) and S. pyogenes (MIC: 200 mug/ml). The phytochemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract afforded plumbagin, canaliculatin, ismailin, betulinic acid and 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-coumarin as the main constituents. Plumbagin and ismailin were found to be responsible for the main biological activities observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results may provide a rational support for the traditional use of Diospyros bipindensis stem bark in the treatment of respiratory disorders, since the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds isolated from the dichloromethane extract were also present in the traditional water extract.
TI  - Bacterial coinfection in influenza: a grand rounds review.
AB  - Bacterial coinfection complicated nearly all influenza deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic and up to 34% of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infections managed in intensive care units worldwide. More than 65,000 deaths attributable to influenza and pneumonia occur annually in the United States. Data from 683 critically ill patients with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection admitted to 35 intensive care units in the United States reveal that bacterial coinfection commonly occurs within the first 6 days of influenza infection, presents similarly to influenza infection occurring alone, and is associated with an increased risk of death. Pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, are most commonly isolated. Complex viral, bacterial, and host factors contribute to the pathogenesis of coinfection. Reductions in morbidity and mortality are dependent on prevention with available vaccines as well as early diagnosis and treatment.
TI  - Novel topoisomerase inhibitors: microbiological characterisation and in vivo efficacy of pyrimidines.
AB  - Pyrimidine compounds were identified as inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase IV through high-throughput screening. This study was designed to exemplify the in vitro activity of the pyrimidines against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms, to reveal the mode of action of these compounds and to demonstrate their in vivo efficacy. Frequencies of resistance to pyrimidines among Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were <10(-10) at four times their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These compounds exhibited a dual mode of action through inhibition of the ParE subunit of DNA topoisomerase IV as well as the GyrB subunit of DNA gyrase, a homologue of DNA topoisomerase IV. Pyrimidines were shown to have MIC(90) values (MIC that inhibited 90% of the strains tested) of </=2 mg/L against Gram-positive pathogens, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, quinolone- and meticillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, and MIC(90) values of 2- to >16 mg/L and </=0.5 mg/L against the Gram-negative pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively. The pyrimidines were bactericidal and exhibited a ca. 1000-fold reduction of the bacterial counts at 300 mg/kg in a S. pneumoniae lung infection model. The microbiological properties and in vivo efficacy of pyrimidines underscore their potential as candidates for the treatment of soft-tissue infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different Finnish monofloral honeys against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and phenolic compounds of five Finnish honey products  against important human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were analyzed. Microbroth dilution method and HPLC-DAD were used in antimicrobial testing and phenolic compound determination, respectively. Significant antimicrobial activity (p < 0.01) against all the tested pathogens was found from willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium), heather (Calluna vulgaris), and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) honeys. This is the first report on antimicrobial activity of Finnish monofloral honeys against streptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria. To our knowledge this is also the first report on the antimicrobial effect of honey against S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. Their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. Many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. Among them, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis are discussed here. An environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. Thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding RNAs are the topic of this chapter. The regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. Understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.
TI  - Impact of respiratory viral infections on alpha-hemolytic streptococci and otopathogens in the nasopharynx of young children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization in a cohort of children to determine the impact of viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) on nonpneumococcal alpha-hemolytic streptococci (AHS) and otopathogen colonization in association with acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: NP samples were collected routinely when children were aged 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 30 months and during episodes of AOM. NP samples were prospectively obtained from 248 children during a 5-year time span: 1018 during routine visits, 161 at the time of AOM and 59 at follow-up visits 3 weeks after AOM. RESULTS: The overall NP colonization rate of AHS was 50.8% during a non-AOM visit but declined to 38.3% during a viral URI with concurrent AOM (P = 0.0006). Of 56 AOM visits with paired follow-ups, 6 (10.7%) had AHS in the NP at the time of viral URI and concurrent AOM whereas 29 (51.8%) had AHS at the follow-up (P < 0.001). Lower NP colonization rates with AHS were associated with significant increases in Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage during non-AOM visits (P < 0.001) and during viral URI and concurrent AOM visits (P = 0.003). AHS NP colonization rates were not different when children had a viral URI without AOM versus when they were URI negative, but NP colonization with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae rates increased (P < 0.001) and Moraxella catarrhalis decreased (P < 0.001) during viral URI. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infections alter NP carriage rates of commensal AHS and otopathogens, including before AOM.
TI  - Synthesis of novel lincomycin derivatives and their in vitro antibacterial activities.
AB  
TI  - A retrospective evaluation of microbiology of acute otitis media complicated by spontaneous otorrhea in children living in Milan, Italy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) with otorrhea due to spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation (STMP) in children living in Milan, Italy. METHODS: We evaluated middle ear fluid (MEF) specimens taken from children affected by AOM associated with STMP and otorrhea between January 2001 and December 2011. The fluid was collected by means of direct swab sampling, sent for culture, and processed within 4 h. RESULTS: A total of 705 specimens were obtained from 458 children (233 boys; mean age +/- SD 28.3 +/- 19.9 months), and were positive for bacteria in 487 cases (69.1 %). The most frequently cultured infectious agent in single-pathogen cultures was Haemophilus. influenzae (51.0 %), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (19.4 %), Streptococcus pyogenes (17.4 %), and Staphylococcus aureus (10.7 %). After adjusting for the sub-period of data collection, age, gender, and previous full heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) schedule, it was found that the prevalence of H. influenzae slightly increased in 2008-2010, and the prevalence of S. pneumoniae significantly decreased over time (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: AOM with STMP is a particular form of AOM in which S. pyogenes plays a significant causative role although, as in uncomplicated cases, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae retain their etiological importance. The frequency of the detection of S. aureus in MEF deserves further study because this pathogen can give rise to severe clinical problems. Finally, although the use of PCV-7 was relatively efficacious, the benefit of pneumococcal vaccination would be increased by vaccines including a larger number of serotypes.
TI  - Incidence and clinical variables associated with streptococcal throat infections: a prospective diagnostic cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of pharyngitis is commonly based on features which are thought to be associated with Lancefield group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) but it is debatable which features best predict GABHS. Non-group A strains share major virulence factors with group A, but it is unclear how commonly they present and whether their presentation differs. AIM: To assess the incidence and clinical variables associated with streptococcal infections. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective diagnostic cohort study in UK primary care. METHOD: The presence of pathogenic streptococci from throat swabs was assessed among patients aged >/=5 years presenting with acute sore throat. RESULTS: Pathogenic streptococci were found in 204/597 patients (34%, 95% CI = 31 to 38%): 33% (68/204) were non-group A streptococci, mostly C (n = 29), G (n = 18) and B (n = 17); rarely D (n = 3) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1). Patients presented with similar features whether the streptococci were group A or non-group A. The features best predicting A, C or G beta-haemolytic streptococci were patient's assessment of severity (odds ratio [OR] for a bad sore throat 3.31, 95% CI = 1.24 to 8.83); doctors' assessment of severity (severely inflamed tonsils OR 2.28, 95% CI = 1.39 to 3.74); absence of a bad cough (OR 2.73, 95% CI = 1.56 to 4.76), absence of a coryza (OR 1.54, 95% CI = 0.99 to 2.41); and moderately bad or worse muscle aches (OR 2.20, 95% CI = 1.41 to 3.42). CONCLUSION: Non-group A strains commonly cause streptococcal sore throats, and present with similar symptomatic clinical features to group A streptococci. The best features to predict streptococcal sore throat presenting in primary care deserve revisiting.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the bacterial etiology of clinically problematic acute otitis media after tympanocentesis or spontaneous otorrhea in German children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute Otitis Media (AOM) is an important and common disease of childhood. Bacteria isolated from cases of clinically problematic AOM in German children were identified and characterized. METHODS: In a prospective non-interventional study in German children between 3 months and less than 60 months of age with Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist -confirmed AOM, middle ear fluid was obtained by tympanocentesis (when clinically indicated) or by careful sampling of otorrhea through/at an existing perforation. RESULTS: In 100 children with severe AOM, Haemophilus influenzae was identified in 21% (18/21, 85.7% were non-typeable [NTHi]), Streptococcus pneumoniae in 10%, S. pyogenes in 13% and Moraxella catarrhalis in 1%. H. influenzae was the most frequently identified pathogen in children from 12 months of age. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were equally prevalent in children aged 3-11 months, but S. pyogenes was most frequently isolated in this age group. NTHi AOM disease appeared prevalent in all ages. CONCLUSIONS: NTHi, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are implicated as important causes of complicated AOM in children in Germany. NTHi disease appears prevalent in all ages. The impact of vaccination to prevent NTHi and S. pneumoniae AOM may be substantial in this population and is worth investigating.
TI  - A deeper analysis of the epitope/paratope of PLY-5, a mouse monoclonal antibody which recognises the conserved undecapeptide tryptophan-rich loop (ECTGLAWEWWR) of bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - A previous study showed that the minimal epitope recognised by the PLY-5 mAb in the conserved undecapeptide Trp-rich loop of bacterial CDCs should consist of WEWWRT (Jacobs et al., 1999) [5]. Now, through immunoscreening of amino acid substitution analogues, it is concluded that the second Trp and the Arg residues are essential in the PLY-5 epitope. The E residue is an auxiliary epitope contributor. Antibody modelling and docking simulations provided support for these findings. For recognition by the antibody, the Trp-rich loop flipped out, mimicking the mechanism of membrane insertion. The displaced second Trp was seen to establish aromatic stacking interactions with aromatic residues of the antibody paratope and the notably extruded guanidium tip of the arginine residue mediated electrostatic interactions with well-exposed carboxylic groups of glutamic residues on the surface of the paratope. Thus, the epitope/paratope interaction is mainly mediated by aromatic and by ionic interactions.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - Subdural empyema in bacterial meningitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence, treatment, and outcome of subdural empyema complicating community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults. METHODS: Case series from a prospective nationwide cohort study from Dutch hospitals from 2006 to 2011. RESULTS: Subdural empyema was diagnosed in 28 of 1,034 episodes (2.7%), and was present on admission in 10 episodes and diagnosed during admission in 18. Predisposing conditions were present in 26 patients (93%), and consisted of otitis or sinusitis in 21 patients (75%). In all these patients the otitis or sinusitis spread to the subdural space. Twenty-three patients (82%) presented with neurologic symptoms (paresis, focal seizures, dysesthesia contralateral to the empyema). Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 26 patients (93%) and Streptococcus pyogenes in 1 (3%); 1 patient had negative CSF cultures. Clinical course was frequently complicated with seizures (50%), focal neurologic abnormalities (54%), and hearing impairment (39%), causing an unfavorable outcome in 19 episodes (68%). Neurosurgical evacuation of the empyema was performed in 5 patients, all with considerable midline shift. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, subdural empyema must be considered in patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis and otitis or sinusitis, focal neurologic deficits, or epileptic seizures. S pneumoniae is the predominant causative organism and neurosurgical intervention should be regarded as first-choice therapy in patients with empyema causing midline shift and focal neurologic abnormalities or a decreased level of consciousness.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children: drainage or mastoidectomy?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the management of mastoid subperiosteal abscess using two  different surgical approaches: simple mastoidectomy and abscess drainage. METHOD: The medical records of 34 children suffering from acute mastoiditis with subperiosteal abscess were retrospectively reviewed. In these cases, the initial surgical approach consisted of either myringotomy plus simple mastoidectomy or myringotomy plus abscess drainage. RESULTS: Thirteen children were managed with simple mastoidectomy and 21 children were initially managed with abscess drainage. Of the second group, 12 children were cured without further treatment while 9 eventually required mastoidectomy. None of the children developed complications during hospitalisation, or long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION: Simple mastoidectomy remains the most effective procedure for the management of mastoid subperiosteal abscess. Drainage of the abscess represents a simple and risk-free, but not always curative, option. It can be safely used as an initial, conservative approach in association with myringotomy and sufficient antibiotic coverage, with simple mastoidectomy reserved for non-responding cases.
TI  - Epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of culture-proven acute otitis media in Taiwanese children.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in children. Here, we describe the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of AOM in Taiwanese children over a 10-year period. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with culture-proven AOM who were treated at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei between 1999-2008. The data include demographic characteristics, clinical history, and microbiological characteristics. RESULTS: Six hundred and fourteen patients were included. The male:female ratio was 1.4 (p<0.001). Greater than three-fourths of the patients (476 [77.5%]) were < 5 years of age, and most patients were 1-2 years of age. The most common isolated pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (419 patients [68.2%]), followed by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi; 118 patients [19.2%]). The distributions of age, gender, use of tympanocentesis, history of previous AOM, and use of antibiotic between patients infected with the two pathogens were not significantly different. However, the number of patients with AOM caused by S. pneumoniae, but not NTHi, decreased during the study period (p=0.004). Three hundred and eighty-seven children (63.0%) with AOM developed spontaneous otorrhea. Compared with patients who underwent tympanocentesis, those with spontaneous otorrhea were younger (27.0+/-16.4 vs. 31.1+/-15.2 months of age, p=0.004), more likely to have a previous history of AOM (p=0.019), and more likely to receive more antibiotics (p=0.012). The third most common pathogen was S. pyogenes (25 patients [4.1%]). S. pyogenes occurred more often in children > 5 years of age and was associated with spontaneous otorrhea (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae and NTHi are common causes of culture-confirmed AOM in Taiwanese children. Although S. pyogenes is not as common, it usually causes AOM in children > 5 years of age and is associated with spontaneous otorrhea.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activity of clofoctol.
AB  - The aim of the study was to examine the In vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens to clofoctol compared with amoxicillin and erythromycin, and to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of clofoctol using a murine pneumonia infection model. Strains clinically isolated from patients between 2005 and 2009 were used to examine susceptibility: penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. The In vitro activity of clofoctol against clinical isolates has essentially remained unchanged over recent years. The MIC(5)(0) and MIC(9)(0) of clofoctol against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae are lower than that of amoxicillin and erythromycin. The area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) ratio is the PK/PD parameter that best correlates with in vivo clofoctol efficacy; the value of AUC/MIC required to achieve the maximum effect in this study was 75.5.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect ABSTRACT: The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new MRSA-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2010. In over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility. An alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the USA. Very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at </= 8 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing S. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone MIC at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible category) when testing Haemophilus influenzae. Only when testing indicated Enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). These presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.
TI  - Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen exposure as a cause of Streptococcus pyogenes-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
AB  - Infection with Streptococcus pyogenes, a Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS), is a rare cause of hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS). Invasive infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae that produce neuraminidase are a well-recognized cause of HUS without diarrhea. The Thomsen- Friedenreich antigen (T antigen) plays a role in the pathophysiology of pneumococcal HUS. We describe the case of a 3-year-old boy with GAS-associated HUS and show how T-antigen exposure was implicated in this case. He had no diarrhea and cultures for blood, urine, and stool were negative. The urinary pneumococcal antigen was negative; his direct Coombs test was positive. Glomerular capillary loops, tubular epithelium on his renal biopsy specimen, and red blood cells in his blood smear showed positive fluorescence with anti-T lectin. Although the pathogenesis of GAS-associated HUS is not well understood, T-antigen exposure may be implicated in some cases with GAS-associated HUS.
TI  - Structure of a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum islandicum.
AB  - The crystal structure of an extremely thermostable UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDP-GDH) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum islandicum was determined at a resolution of 2.0 A. The overall fold was comprised of an N-terminal NAD(+) dinucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal UDP-sugar binding domain connected by a long alpha-helix, and the main-chain coordinates of the enzyme were similar to those of previously studied UDP-GDHs, including the enzymes from Burkholderia cepacia, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the sizes of several surface loops in P. islandicum UDP-GDH were much smaller than the corresponding loops in B. cepacia UDP-GDH but were comparable to those of the S. pyogenes and K. pneumoniae enzymes. Structural comparison revealed that the presence of extensive intersubunit hydrophobic interactions, as well as the formation of an intersubunit aromatic pair network, is likely to be the main factor contributing to the hyperthermostability of P. islandicum UDP-GDH.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Protein domain repetition is enriched in Streptococcal cell-surface proteins.
AB  - Tandem repetition of domain in protein sequence occurs in all three domains of life. It creates protein diversity and adds functional complexity in organisms. In this work, we analyzed 52 streptococcal genomes and found 3748 proteins contained domain repeats. Proteins not harboring domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasm, whereas proteins with domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasmic membrane, cell wall and extracellular locations. Domain repetition occurs most frequently in S. pneumoniae and least in S. thermophilus and S. pyogenes. DUF1542 is the highest repeated domain in a single protein, followed by Rib, CW_binding_1, G5 and HemolysinCabind. 3D structures of 24 repeat-containing proteins were predicted to investigate the structural and functional effect of domain repetition. Several repeat-containing streptococcal cell surface proteins are known to be virulence-associated. Surface-associated tandem domain-containing proteins without experimental functional characterization may be potentially involved in the pathogenesis of streptococci and deserve further investigation.
TI  - [Necrotizing pneumonia - a rare complication].
AB  - Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of community-acquired pneumonia associated with destruction of the lung tissue during the infection and rise of necrotic foci in consolidated areas. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Nocardia, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative agents. Risk factors for developing necrotizing pneumonia include smoking, alcoholism, old age, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases or liver disease. Diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia requires supportive care, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis and respiratory failure. Hemoptysis, abscess, empyema and gangrene are possible complications and surgical intervention may be required. The authors present a clinical case of pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia in a patient without important risk factors and favourable progression with medical therapy. In this regard, a brief bibliographic review about this pathology is also made.
TI  - Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  - Vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.
TI  - [Acute otitis media: prevalence of ear pathogens in patients at a public hospital].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in childhood and is the most common cause of antibiotic prescriptions in children. The gold standard for identifying the pathogens causing AOM is tympanocentesis. This is only possible in the stage of AOM when exudate is retained in the middle ear. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of organisms causing AOM in eutrophic patients at a public paediatric hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included all patients with AOM diagnosed by otomicroscopy with purulent exudate retained in middle ear and suppurative AOM with inadequate drainage consulting at the Otorhinolaryngology Department in a paediatric tertiary care centre from 2 May 2009 to 31 August 2010. RESULTS: There were 324 patients included in the study, with 180/324 (55.6%) being male. The median age was 8 months (interquartile range: 4 to 15 months). Bilateral AOM was recorded in 109/324 (33.6%) patients (433 samples for culture were obtained by tympanocentesis in 324 patients). At diagnosis, 37% (120/324) of the children had been receiving antimicrobial treatment. Of the patients who had received antibiotics, 71/120 (59.1%) had bacterial growth in middle ear fluid (MEF) cultures, with 51/71 (71.8%) being susceptible to the antibiotic they received; 20/71 (28.2%) patients were receiving an antibiotic that did not cover the spectrum of organisms isolated. CONCLUSION: The pathogens most frequently isolated are Streptococcus pneumoniae (39.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (37.4%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.1%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (3.0%).
TI  - Paediatric complicated pneumonia: Diagnosis and management of empyema.
AB  - Pneumonia can be complicated by an empyema, progressing from an exudative effusion, to a fibrinopurulent stage with loculations, and then organized with a thick fibrinous peel. The predominant causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphyloccocus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes. Recently, an increased incidence of paediatric complicated pneumonia has been reported. For diagnostic imaging, a chest radiograph followed by a chest ultrasound is preferred. Computed tomography chest scans, with associated radiation, should not be routinely used. Antibiotic coverage should treat the most common causative organisms. Additional invasive or surgical management is recommended to reduce the duration of illness in cases not promptly responding to antibiotics or with significant respiratory compromise. Choice of management should be guided by best evidence and local expertise. Video-assisted thorascopic surgery or insertion of a small-bore percutaneous chest tube with instillation of fibrinolytics are the best current options.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children aged 0-16 years--a national study of 678 cases in Sweden comparing different age groups.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of acute mastoiditis in children in different age groups in order to identify risk groups and risk factors for acute mastoiditis. METHODS: Records for all children aged 0-16 years treated for acute mastoiditis during 1993-2007 at 33 Ear, Nose and Throat departments in Sweden were reviewed retrospectively according to defined criteria for acute mastoiditis. RESULTS: A total of 678 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age and this group was characterized by less prior history of other diseases and ear diseases, fewer visits to health care centers and less antibiotic treatment before admission, shorter duration of symptoms before admission, hospitalization for fewer days and lower frequency of complications and mastoidectomies. These children also showed a higher incidence of clinical findings, increased inflammatory markers such as fever and heightened counts of C-reactive protein and white blood cells compared with older children. They also tested positive for significantly more samples of Streptococcus pneumoniae while the older children more often exhibited growth of Streptococcus pyogenes or Pseudomonas aeruginosa or no microbial growth. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of pediatric acute mastoiditis differed significantly between age groups. Acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age. They showed more rapid progress of symptoms and more distinct signs of acute mastoiditis. This is probably the reason why parents rapidly seek medical care for small children and hospital treatment thus starts earlier in the youngest children, which may in turn explain the excellent outcome. This study showed that younger children have neither more severe acute mastoiditis nor more complications than older ones. The differences between age groups suggest that there are distinctions in the pathophysiology behind the onset and course of acute mastoiditis in younger and older children.
TI  - Identification of genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of invasive pneumococcal disease by in vivo transcriptomic analysis.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) continues to be responsible for a high level of global morbidity and mortality resulting from pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media. Here we have used a novel technique involving niche-specific, genome-wide in vivo transcriptomic analyses to identify genes upregulated in distinct niches during pathogenesis after intranasal infection of mice with serotype 4 or 6A pneumococci. The analyses yielded 28 common, significantly upregulated genes in the lungs relative to those in the nasopharynx and 25 significantly upregulated genes in the blood relative to those in the lungs in both strains, some of which were previously unrecognized. The role of five upregulated genes from either the lungs or the blood in pneumococcal pathogenesis and virulence was then evaluated by targeted mutagenesis. One of the mutants (DeltamalX) was significantly attenuated for virulence in the lungs, two (DeltaaliA and DeltailvH) were significantly attenuated for virulence in the blood relative to the wild type, and two others (DeltacbiO and DeltapiuA) were completely avirulent in a mouse intranasal challenge model. We also show that the products of aliA, malX, and piuA are promising candidates for incorporation into multicomponent protein-based pneumococcal vaccines currently under development. Importantly, we suggest that this new approach is a viable complement to existing strategies for the discovery of genes critical to the distinct stages of invasive pneumococcal disease and potentially has broad application for novel protein antigen discovery in other pathogens such as S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Surveillance Committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2009: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) started a survey in 2006. From 2009, JSC continued the survey in collaboration with the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology. The fourth-year survey was conducted during the period from January and April 2009 by the three societies. A total of 684 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 635 strains (130 Staphylococcus aureus, 127 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 123 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 78 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 103 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A maximum of 45 antibacterial agents including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), four aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 58.5 %, and that of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) was 6.3 % and 0.0 %, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.1 % of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 18.7 % to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.7 % to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5 %) of beta-lactamase-producing strains has been suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2 %) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5 %) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9 %) suspected multi-drug resistant strains showing resistance against imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continuous national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - The cryptic competence pathway in Streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. Transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked DNA is acquired from the extracellular environment. Induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in DNA uptake, processing, and recombination. All streptococcal species contain the master regulator SigX and SigX-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. We recently demonstrated that competence development in Streptococcus mutans requires the type II ComRS quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an Rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (L. Mashburn-Warren, D. A. Morrison, and M. J. Federle, Mol. Microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). The type II ComRS system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we describe the activation of sigX by a small-peptide pheromone and an Rgg regulator of the type II ComRS class. We confirm previous reports that SigX is functional and able to activate sigX-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that SigX stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease ClpP. Genomic analyses of available S. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. While this is the first report to show natural induction of sigX, S. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. Using radiolabeled DNA, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of DNA uptake.
TI  - Recent trend of necrotizing fasciitis in Taiwan: focus on monomicrobial Klebsiella pneumoniae necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening soft-tissue infection that is traditionally caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) or mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteria. Monomicrobial Klebsiella pneumoniae NF (KP-NF) has been reported since 1996 but has not yet been systematically studied. METHODS: We retrospectively studied consecutive NF cases treated at a university hospital in Taiwan during 1997-2010 and investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with monomicrobial KP-NF, using monomicrobial GAS-NF as a reference. We also analyzed the virulence gene profiles of the isolated K. pneumoniae strains. RESULTS: Of 134 NF cases, 88 were monomicrobial, of which the most common pathogens were GAS (n = 16) and K. pneumoniae (n = 15). Monomicrobial KP-NF entailed a moderate risk of limb loss (20% vs 25%; P = 1.000) and high mortality (47% vs 19%; P = .135), and it was more likely to involve bacteremia (80% vs 31%; P = .011), concomitant distant abscesses (27% vs 0%; P = .043), and underlying immunocompromising conditions (100% vs 63%; P = .018), compared with GAS-NF. The isolated K. pneumoniae strains (n = 10) were of capsular polysaccharides genotype K1 (n = 4), K54/K20/K5 (n = 4), K2 (n = 1), and K16 (n = 1). All strains carried rmpA, iucABCDiutA, and iroA. Genotype K1 strains had a significantly higher risk of concomitant distant abscesses, compared with non-K1 strains (75% vs 0%; P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae has become a common pathogen of monomicrobial NF in Taiwan. Physicians treating patients with monomicrobial KP-NF should be aware of the risk of concomitant distant abscesses, particularly in cases caused by genotype K1.
TI  - Characterization of a Streptococcus suis tet(O/W/32/O)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - Mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. They may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. Initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. In the genus Streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(O/W/32/O)] was first discovered in Streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. In this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(O/W/32/O) gene-carrying mobile element from an S. suis isolate. tet(O/W/32/O) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% G+C; 17 open reading frames [ORFs] identified). The novel element, which we designated 15K, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(B) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aadE (streptomycin) and aphA (kanamycin). 15K appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. In the integrated form, 15K was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ICE) (50.5% G+C; 55 ORFs), which we designated ICESsu32457. An approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15K element was identified. The novel ICE was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic Streptococcus species (S. suis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15K element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.
TI  - Lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. Lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. However, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of Gram positive pathogens, including strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. It is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. Here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.
TI  - Naturally occurring swine influenza A virus PB1-F2 phenotypes that contribute to  superinfection with Gram-positive respiratory pathogens.
AB  - A combination of viral, bacterial, and host factors contributes to the severity and overall mortality associated with influenza virus-bacterium superinfections. To date, the virulence associated with the recently identified influenza virus protein PB1-F2 has been largely defined using models of primary influenza virus infection, with only limited assessment in models of Streptococcus pneumoniae superinfection. Specifically, these studies have incorporated isogenic viruses that differ in the PB1-F2 expressed, but there is still knowledge to be gained from evaluation of natural variants derived from a nonhuman host species (swine). Using this rationale, we developed the hypothesis that naturally occurring viruses expressing variants of genes, like the PB1-F2 gene, can be associated with the severity of secondary bacterial infections. To test this hypothesis, we selected viruses expressing variants in PB1-F2 and evaluated outcomes from superinfection with three distinct Gram-positive respiratory pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Our results demonstrate that the amino acid residues 62L, 66S, 75R, 79R, and 82L, previously proposed as molecular signatures of PB1-F2 virulence for influenza viruses in the setting of bacterial superinfection, are broadly associated with enhanced pathogenicity in swine in a bacterium-specific manner. Furthermore, truncated PB1-F2 proteins can preferentially increase mortality when associated with Streptococcus pyogenes superinfection. These findings support efforts to increase influenza virus surveillance to consider viral genotypes that could be used to predict increased severity of superinfections with specific Gram-positive respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  - The on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. Here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. The robustness of our approach lies in the novel method for the production of the SER substrate based on silver nanoparticles and their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. The method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial SERS substrates.
TI  - Group A streptococcus adheres to pharyngeal epithelial cells with salivary proline-rich proteins via GrpE chaperone protein.
AB  - Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is an important human pathogen that frequently causes pharyngitis. GAS organisms can adhere to and invade pharyngeal epithelial cells, which are overlaid by salivary components. However, the role of salivary components in GAS adhesion to pharyngeal cells has not been reported precisely. We collected human saliva and purified various salivary components, including proline-rich protein (PRP), statherin, and amylase, and performed invasion assays. The GAS-HEp-2 association ratio (invasion/adhesion ratio) and invasion ratio of GAS were increased significantly with whole human saliva and PRP, while the anti-PRP antibody inhibited the latter. GAS strain NY-5, which lacks M and F proteins on the cell surface, was promoted to cohere with HEp-2 cells by whole human saliva and PRP. The 28-kDa protein of GAS bound to PRP and was identified as GrpE, a chaperone protein, whereas the N-terminal of GrpE was found to bind to PRP. A GrpE-deficient mutant of GAS strain B514Sm, TR-45, exhibited a reduced ability to adhere to and invade HEp-2 cells. Microscopic observations showed the GrpE was mainly expressed on the surface of the cell division site of GAS. Furthermore, GrpE-deficient mutants of GAS and Streptococcus pneumoniae showed an elongated morphology as compared with the wild type. Taken together, this is the first study to show an interaction between salivary PRP and GAS GrpE, which plays an important role in GAS infection on the pharynx, whereas the expression of GrpE on the surface of GAS helps to maintain morphology.
TI  - Bacterial interactions in the nasopharynx - effects of host factors in children attending day-care centers.
AB  - The nasopharynges of preschool children are often colonized by potentially pathogenic bacteria. The interactions between these common pathogens and certain host factors were investigated in healthy preschool children 1-6 years of age. Nasopharynx samples were collected from all 63 children attending a day-care center that experienced an outbreak of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The samples were analyzed for S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Group A Streptococci. A model for the risk of carrying these bacteria was established using logistic regression. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae antagonize each other, whereas M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae have a positively association. The risk of carrying M. catarrhalis decreases with age. The time spent in day care each week was not shown to influence the rate of carriage of any of these pathogens. The negative effect of H. influenzae on S. pneumoniae is discussed in relation to the carriage of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and possible mechanisms involved in this interaction are presented.
TI  - Guideline for the management of acute sore throat.
AB  - The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.
TI  - Clinical streptococci and their sensitivity to enterocins produced by different strains of the species Enterococcus faecium (short communication).
AB  - In children, acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most frequently occurring infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Str. pyogenes. The standard treatment of AOMis provided by antibiotics; however, an increased resistance of the causative agents to antibiotics requires the need to search for innovations. This study was focused on in vitro testing sensitivity of streptococci isolated from AOM to enterocins produced by 9 different origin strains of E. faecium. Enterocins (Ent) represent ribosomally synthesized proteinaceous substances with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacteria which are produced mostly by strains of the species Enterococcus faecium. Str. pneumoniae were sensitive at least to 1 Ent. Str. pneumoniae SPn 754 was sensitive to 5 Ent. Five Str. pyogenes were sensitive to enterocins. Ent A (P) inhibited the growth of 3 Str. pneumoniae, and 4 Str. pyogenes (activity between 100 and 3,200 AU/ml). Most of Ent inhibited the growth of streptococci tested (100-3,200 AU/ml). Str. pyogenes were more sensitive to Ent than Str. pneumoniae. Although more detailed further studies are required, our results indicate a new possibility for enterocin use.
TI  - [Taxonomic characteristics and mixed communities of wound infection agents in patients of reanimation and surgical departments of a hospital].
AB  - AIM: Study of taxonomical structure ofwound infection agents, prevalence of mixes, and detection of character of their possible connection with the results of various microorganisms population interaction in septic wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microbiological study of material from patients with wound infection (WI), 582 of those were cured in reanimation and intensive therapy departments (RITD; group 1) and 1455 - in surgical departments (SD; group 2), was performed. Taxonomic membership and ability to coexist was determined in 4129 microorganisms strains. Etiological role of the agents was evaluated by using values of consistency rate (CR). Species that were present in more than 50% of samples were considered consistent, in 25 to 50%--additional, and in less than 25%--random. Frequency rates (FR) were also determined, that is the fraction of a certain species (genus) of the microorganism (in %) from all the isolated cultures that correspond to 100%. For the determination of the significance of individual species of the agent in the structure of mixed microorganism populations, FR - their fraction (%) in mixed population from the number of strains of this species that correspond to 100% - was calculated. RESULTS: A significant part of the microorganisms strains, more frequently in reanimation department (65.5%), caused wound suppuration in populations mixed with other species of the agents. In reanimation and surgical departments consistent species of wound infection agents were not detected. A leading etiological role of Staphylococcus aureus (FR 19.2% and 23.9%) was determined, and FR of S. aureus strains in mixes was 64.6% in RITD and 46.8% in SD. The parameters ofotheragents of WI in the comparison groups were similar. However FR among mixes in RITD were significantly higher for streptococci that do not belong to S. pyogenes species (72,5%), and also nonfermentative microorganisms (67,2%), and in SD - in Klebsiella pneumoniae mixes. For agents of wound infection especially in RITD, low species diversity was characteristic and the number of mixes variants is significantly higher. In RITD mixed infections develop more frequently, and the ecological community of microorganisms reaches higher values than in SD. CONCLUSION: During the analysis of microbiologi-cal data in RITD and SD general patterns and specific features of taxonomical structure, prevalence of mixed populations and character of their ecological community in wound infection was determined.
TI  - Minim typing--a rapid and low cost MLST based typing tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences on the basis of maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0.979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0.929), and the other using HRM data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0.995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.
TI  - Subtractive genomics approach to identify putative drug targets and identification of drug-like molecules for beta subunit of DNA polymerase III in Streptococcus species.
AB  - The prolonged use of the antibiotics over the years has transformed many organisms resistant to multiple drugs. This has made the field of drug discovery of vital importance in curing various infections and diseases. The drugs act by binding to a specific target protein of prime importance for the cell's survival. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes are the few gram positive organisms that have developed resistance to drugs. It causes pneumonia, meningitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bacteremia, pericarditis, and arthritis infections. The present study was carried out to identify potential drug targets and inhibitors for beta subunit of DNA polymerase III in these three Streptococcus species that might facilitate the discovery of novel drugs in near future. Various steps were adopted to find out novel drug targets. And finally 3D structure of DNA polymerase III subunit beta was modeled. The ligand library was generated from various databases to find the most suitable ligands. All the ligands were docked using Molegro Virtual Docker and the lead molecules were investigated for ADME and toxicity.
TI  - A bioactive flavonoid from Pavetta crassipes K. Schum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our continued search for bioactive compounds from plants, conscious effort is being made to rapidly analyze ethnobotanical plants used for treating various ailments by traditional healers before this information is irrevocably lost as societies advance and rural communities become urbanized. RESULTS: A compound isolated from the aqueous extract of Pavetta crassipes leaves showed activity against some pathogenic microorganisms which included Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium ulcerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli at a concentration < 50 mg/mL. The compound had minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration ranging from 12.5 to 25 mg/mL. The compound was identified using 1D and 2D NMR experiments and comparison with literature data as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. CONCLUSIONS: This has supported the ethnomedicinal use of the plant, confirmed its activity, and has also provided an easy and simple method for isolating this compound which has a lot of pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications from a new source.
TI  - Nasopharyngeal biofilm-producing otopathogens in children with nonsevere recurrent acute otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial biofilms have been detected in biopsies of the adenoid and middle ear mucosa of otitis-prone children and children with chronic middle otitis media. However, the invasiveness of biopsy makes it unsuitable for routine clinical practice, especially in pediatrics. This study aimed to investigate nasopharyngeal biofilm-producing otopathogens (BPOs) of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) in children with a history of nonsevere recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) and healthy controls. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with planned data collection. SETTING: University of Milan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Transoral NPS were taken from infants and children aged 10 months to 11 years with nonsevere RAOM or healthy controls without adenoid hypertrophy. Nasopharyngeal colonization by otopathogens was assessed by means of microbiological cultures and standard bacterial identification, as well as nasopharyngeal BPOs by means of spectrophotometric analysis. RESULTS: The study involved 113 children (56.6% males; median age 40 months; range, 10-132 months): 58 with a history of nonsevere RAOM (51.3%) and 55 controls (48.7%). Otopathogens were significantly more frequently detected in the RAOM group (24/58, 41.4%) than in controls (8/55, 14.5%; P = .003); the main pathogens were respectively Haemophilus influenzae (12/24, 50.0%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (3/8, 37.5%). Nasopharyngeal BPOs were more frequently isolated in the RAOM group (17/58, 29.3%) than in controls (6/55, 10.9%; P = .02). H influenzae (12/17, 70.6%) was confirmed as the main pathogen in the RAOM group. CONCLUSION: The presence of nasopharyngeal BPOs is an important factor favoring RAOM; it is therefore useful investigating biofilms even in children with nonsevere recurrences of AOM without adenoid hypertrophy.
TI  - Autopsy cases of fulminant bacterial infection in adults: clinical onset depends  on the virulence of bacteria and patient immune status.
AB  - To assist physicians in recognizing the potentially fatal onset of symptoms in cases of fulminant bacterial infection, we analyzed 11 autopsy cases of such infection (four caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, four by S. pyogenes, one by S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, one by Staphylococcus aureus, and one by Vibrio vulnificus). Clinicohistopathologic features were evaluated. All patients experienced sudden onset of hypotension and multiple organ failure, leading to unexpected death. Blood culture confirmed bacteremia. The main chief complaints were gastrointestinal symptoms (45%) and limb pain (36%). All had an underlying chronic illness (82%), e.g., a hematologic disorder (36.3%) or liver cirrhosis (27.2%). Necrotizing fasciitis occurred in only 55% of cases, with none involving pneumococcal infection. Laboratory tests typically showed C-reactive protein elevation but without leukocytosis, indicating a high-level inflammatory state. In ten cases, death was attributed to circulatory collapse due to sepsis; severe pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage were present in these cases. The onset of fulminant bacterial infection depends on both virulence of the bacterium and status of the host defense system.
TI  - Identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - The design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. In order to identify potentially conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from Staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. By comparison with previous screening data from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. In particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the N-terminal domain of SACOL0609 (SdrD), the C-terminal domain of SACOL0723 (ScaB) and the C-terminus of SACOL1140 (IsdA) from Staph. aureus. The three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. The antisera were also able to opsonize both Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. The conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.
TI  - Non-capsulated and capsulated Haemophilus influenzae in children with acute otitis media in Venezuela: a prospective epidemiological study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are major causes of bacterial acute otitis media (AOM). Data regarding AOM are limited in Latin America. This is the first active surveillance in a private setting in Venezuela to characterize the bacterial etiology of AOM in children < 5 years of age. METHODS: Between December 2008 and December 2009, 91 AOM episodes (including sporadic, recurrent and treatment failures) were studied in 87 children enrolled into a medical center in Caracas, Venezuela. Middle ear fluid samples were collected either by tympanocentesis or spontaneous otorrhea swab sampling method. Standard laboratory and microbiological techniques were used to identify bacteria and test for antimicrobial resistance. The results were interpreted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2009 for non-meningitis isolates. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 and Microsoft Excel (for graphical purposes). RESULTS: Overall, bacteria were cultured from 69.2% (63 of the 91 episodes); at least one pathogen (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. pyogenes or M. catarrhalis) was cultured from 65.9% (60/91) of episodes. H. influenzae (55.5%; 35/63 episodes) and S. pneumoniae (34.9%; 22/63 episodes) were the most frequently reported bacteria. Among H. influenzae isolates, 62.9% (22/35 episodes) were non-capsulated (NTHi) and 31.4% (11/35 episodes) were capsulated including types d, a, c and f, across all age groups. Low antibiotic resistance for H. influenzae was observed to amoxicillin/ampicillin (5.7%; 2/35 samples). NTHi was isolated in four of the six H. influenzae positive samples (66.7%) from recurrent episodes. CONCLUSIONS: We found H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae to be the main pathogens causing AOM in Venezuela. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with efficacy against these bacterial pathogens may have the potential to maximize protection against AOM.
TI  - Group A streptococcus ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection in a child.

TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel alkylides: 3-O-arylalkyl clarithromycin derivatives with improved antibacterial activities.
AB  - A series of novel alkylides, possessing 3-O-arylalkyl group instead of 3-O-cladinose, were designed, synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities. The increased potency clearly ranked by the order of 3-O-(3-aryl-2-propargyl), 3-O-(3-aryl-E-prop-2-enyl), 3-O-(3-aryl-propyl), and 3-O-(3-aryl-Z-prop-1-enyl) groups. Some alkylides, exemplified by 7a, 10a, 21, 22, 26, 27 and 33, showed improved activities against inducible MLS(B) resistance and efflux resistance compared to the second-generation macrolides. Among them, 26 possessed comparable activities against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (MICs of 0.016-0.5 mug/mL). Moreover, 26 displayed dramatically enhanced potency against both efflux resistant and inducibly MLS(B) resistant strains (MICs of 0.125-0.5 mug/mL) resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin (MICs of 1- >254 mug/mL), independent of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant phenotypes.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, an Emerging Drug-Resistant Animal and Human Pathogen.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. Recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the S. suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. Resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. Some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. The available information strongly suggests that S. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. S. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.
TI  - Different potency of bacterial antigens TLR2 and TLR4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  - The aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) generation. We examined Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (LTA) Staphylococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) Mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (PGN) Staphylococcus aureus, as well as TLR4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Pophyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. We also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6-, CCL5-, and IL-10-priming on mast cell cysLT synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. We found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cysLT generation; however, the extent of cysLT release in response to stimulation varied. Out of the examined antigens LPS P. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cysLT generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/mL). Other LPSs affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. LTAs were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/mL, while LAM and PGN stimulated mast cells to maximal cysLT generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/mL. Anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor significantly diminished cysLT generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. Priming with TNF, IL-6 and CCL5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cysLT generation, while IL-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cysLT synthesis by mast cells. These observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cysLTs strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.
TI  - Etiology of acute, non-malaria, febrile illnesses in Jayapura, northeastern Papua, Indonesia.
AB  - We conducted a prospective, inpatient fever study in malaria-endemic Papua, Indonesia to determine non-malaria fever etiologies. Investigations included malaria blood films, blood culture, paired serologic samples analysis for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, murine typhus, and spotted fever group rickettsia. During 1997-2000, 226 patients (127 males and 99 females) 1-80 years of age (median age = 25 years) were enrolled. Positive blood cultures (n = 34, 15%) were obtained for Salmonella Typhi (n = 13), Escherichia coli (n = 8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1). Twenty (8.8%) patients were positive for leptospirosis by polymerase chain reaction. Eighty (35.4%) of 226 patients had >/= 1 positive serology, diagnostic for 15 rickettsial and 9 dengue cases. Acid-fast bacilli-positive sputum was obtained from three patients. Most common confirmed (81 of 226, 35.8%)/suspected diagnoses were typhoid fever (n = 41), pneumonia (n = 29), leptospirosis (n = 28), urinary tract infections (n = 20), rickettsioses (n = 19), dengue (n = 17), and meningitis/encephalitis (n = 15). There were 17 deaths, 7 (46.7%) were caused by meningitis/encephalitis. Multiple positive serologic results and few confirmed diagnoses indicate the need for improved diagnostics.
TI  - Influenza-like illness surveillance on the California-Mexico border, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2004, the Naval Health Research Center, with San Diego and Imperial counties, has collaborated with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct respiratory disease surveillance in the US-Mexico border region. In 2007, the Secretariat of Health, Mexico and the Institute of Public Health of Baja California joined the collaboration. OBJECTIVES: The identification of circulating respiratory pathogens in respiratory specimens from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS: Demographic, symptom information and respiratory swabs were collected from enrollees who met the case definition for ILI. Specimens underwent PCR testing and culture in virology and bacteriology. RESULTS: From 2004 through 2009, 1855 persons were sampled. Overall, 36% of the participants had a pathogen identified. The most frequent pathogen was influenza (25%), with those aged 6-15 years the most frequently affected. In April 2009, a young female participant from Imperial County, California, was among the first documented cases of 2009 H1N1. Additional pathogens included influenza B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The US-Mexico border is one of the busiest in the world, with a large number of daily crossings. Due to its traffic, this area is an ideal location for surveillance sites. We identified a pathogen in 36% of the specimens tested, with influenza A the most common pathogen. A number of other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens were identified. An understanding of the incidence of respiratory pathogens in border populations is useful for development of regional vaccination and disease prevention responses.
TI  - From meadows to milk to mucosa - adaptation of Streptococcus and Lactococcus species to their nutritional environments.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are indigenous to food-related habitats as well as associated with the mucosal surfaces of animals. The LAB family Streptococcaceae consists of the genera Lactococcus and Streptococcus. Members of the family include the industrially important species Lactococcus lactis, which has a long history safe use in the fermentative food industry, and the disease-causing streptococci Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The central metabolic pathways of the Streptococcaceae family have been extensively studied because of their relevance in the industrial use of some species, as well as their influence on virulence of others. Recent developments in high-throughput proteomic and DNA-microarray techniques, in in vivo NMR studies, and importantly in whole-genome sequencing have resulted in new insights into the metabolism of the Streptococcaceae family. The development of cost-effective high-throughput sequencing has resulted in the publication of numerous whole-genome sequences of lactococcal and streptococcal species. Comparative genomic analysis of these closely related but environmentally diverse species provides insight into the evolution of this family of LAB and shows that the relatively small genomes of members of the Streptococcaceae family have been largely shaped by the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit.
TI  - Management of osteoarticular infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus is similar to that of other etiologies: analysis of 199 staphylococcal bone and joint infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and their combination are considered to warrant especially aggressive treatment if caused by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Our prospective treatment trial of children aged 3 months to 15 years included 199 cases of S. aureus osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or their combination. These cases were compared with 66 cases caused by other agents, mainly Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pyogenes. According to protocol, the treatment was initiated intravenously only for 2 to 4 days and completed orally. Nonstaphylococcal and staphylococcal infections were treated similarly. Primary antibiotics were clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin. Follow-up lasted >/= 12 months posthospitalization. RESULTS: Staphylococcal infections did not significantly differ in the duration of medication, hospital stay, surgery performed, or the number of sequelae when compared with the other etiologic groups. One child with S. aureus arthritis developed 2 late infections by other agents in the same anatomic site. Except 3 mild sequelae (2 caused by S. aureus and 1 by S. pyogenes) 12 months posthospitalization, all patients recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoarticular infections of childhood caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus can be treated according to the same protocol as those used for infections caused by other agents.
TI  - Antibodies to common infectious agents in coronary artery disease patients with and without rheumatic conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The mechanism linking inflammation to atherosclerosis is unknown. We  have previously demonstrated a high occurrence of inflammation in the aortic adventitia of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), which was more pronounced in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs), and which might be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. In theory, infections might play a role in the pathogenesis of vascular inflammation or atherosclerosis, or both. This study compared seropositivity and the burden of several common infections in patients with CAD, both with and without IRD, and in healthy controls (HCs). Moreover, we looked for relationships between the examined antibodies and inflammatory infiltrates in the aortic adventitia. METHODS: We examined sera for Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, CMV, Streptococcus pyogenes, parvovirus B19, HBV and HCV with commercially available serological tests in 67 patients with IRD, 52 patients without IRD and 30 HCs. RESULTS: We observed neither any statistically significant differences in the examined antibodies between the groups nor a difference in the burden of infection. Except for a protective effect of mycoplasma immunoglobulin A (IgA), we did not find any other associations between the examined antibodies and the occurrence of aortic adventitial mononuclear cell infiltrates. CONCLUSION: Our study does not support the notion that chronic infections or infectious burden contribute to accelerated occurrence of CAD in IRD. Mycoplasma IgA was related to a lower occurrence of aortic adventitial inflammation.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of TD-1792, a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer antibiotic used against Gram-positive bacteria, in a neutropenic murine thigh model.
AB  - TD-1792 is a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer investigational antibiotic that displays potent bactericidal effects against clinically relevant Gram-positive organisms in vitro. The present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TD-1792 in the neutropenic murine thigh infection animal model. TD-1792, dosed subcutaneously (SC), produced dose-dependent reduction in the thigh bacterial burden of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSA, MRSA, MSSE, MRSE, respectively), penicillin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). In single-dose efficacy studies, the 1-log(10) CFU kill effective dose (ED(1-log kill)) estimates for TD-1792 ranged from 0.049 to 2.55 mg/kg of body weight administered SC, and the bacterial burden was reduced by up to 3 log(10) CFU/g from pretreatment values. Against S. aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA), the total 24-h log(10) stasis dose (ED(stasis)) and ED(1-logkill) doses for TD-1792 were 0.53 and 1.11 mg/kg/24 h, respectively, compared to 23.4 and 54.6 mg/kg/24 h for vancomycin, indicating that TD-1762 is 44- to 49-fold more potent than vancomycin. PK-PD analysis of data from single-dose and dose-fractionation studies for MRSA (ATCC 33591) demonstrated that the total-drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve-to-MIC ratio (AUC/MIC ratio) was the best predictor of efficacy (r(2) = 0.826) compared to total-drug maximum plasma concentration of drug-to-MIC ratio (Cmax/MIC ratio; r(2) = 0.715) and percent time that the total-drug plasma drug concentration remains above the MIC (%Time>MIC; r(2) = 0.749). The magnitudes of the total-drug AUC/MIC ratios associated with net bacterial stasis, a 1-log(10) CFU reduction from baseline and near maximal effect, were 21.1, 37.2, and 51.8, respectively. PK-PD targets based on such data represent useful inputs for analyses to support dose selection decisions for clinical studies of patients.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - Salivaricin D, a novel intrinsically trypsin-resistant lantibiotic from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c isolated from a healthy infant.
AB  - In this work, we purified and characterized a newly identified lantibiotic (salivaricin D) from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c. Salivaricin D is a 34-amino-acid-residue peptide (3,467.55 Da); the locus of the gene encoding this peptide is a 16.5-kb DNA segment which contains genes encoding the precursor of two lantibiotics, two modification enzymes (dehydratase and cyclase), an ABC transporter, a serine-like protease, immunity proteins (lipoprotein and ABC transporters), a response regulator, and a sensor histidine kinase. The immunity gene (salI) was heterologously expressed in a sensitive indicator and provided significant protection against salivaricin D, confirming its immunity function. Salivaricin D is a naturally trypsin-resistant lantibiotic that is similar to nisin-like lantibiotics. It is a relatively broad-spectrum bacteriocin that inhibits members of many genera of Gram-positive bacteria, including the important human pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c may be a potential biological agent for the control of oronasopharynx-colonizing streptococcal pathogens or may be used as a probiotic bacterium.
TI  - Invasive bacterial infections in relation to influenza outbreaks, 2006-2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to define the excess morbidity associated with bloodstream infections (BSIs), imposed by pandemic H1N1 influenza during 2009-2010 (pH1N1/2009-2010) and seasonal influenza. METHODS: Eight hospitals, accounting for 33% of hospitalizations in Israel, provided data on BSI during 2006-2010. The age-specific incidence of BSI due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes was determined. BSI incidence rate ratios (IRRs) during seasonal and pH1N1 influenza seasons were assessed. RESULTS: Regular influenza seasons were characterized by increased rates of S. pneumoniae BSI but with no increase in S. aureus and S. pyogenes BSI rates. The pH1N1/2009-2010 influenza outbreak was characterized by (1) higher rates of S. pneumoniae bacteremia among children but not among adults (IRRs for S. pneumoniae BSI among children aged 0-4 years during the summer and winter of 2009-2010 were 14.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5-43.7] and 6.5 [95% CI, 3.6-11.8], compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active winter weeks, respectively [P < .0001]), higher rates of S. aureus BSI in all age groups (IRRs during the summer and winter of 2009-2010 were 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4-1.9] and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.7], compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active weeks, respectively [P < .0001]), higher rates of S. pyogenes BSI during 2009-2010 influenza season (IRR 2.7 [95% CI, 1.6-4.6] and 3.3 [95% CI, 1.9-5.8] during the summer and winter of 2009-2010, compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active weeks, respectively [P < .0001]). CONCLUSIONS: pH1N1 influenza seasons were characterized by marked increases in invasive S. aureus and S. pyogenes infections among children and adults, with the highest increase in S. pneumoniae BSI among children.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Dynamic distribution of the SecA and SecY translocase subunits and septal localization of the HtrA surface chaperone/protease during Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 cell division.
AB  - The Sec translocase pathway is the major route for protein transport across and into the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Previous studies reported that the SecA translocase ATP-binding subunit and the cell surface HtrA protease/chaperone formed a single microdomain, termed "ExPortal," in some species of ellipsoidal (ovococcus) Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes. To investigate the generality of microdomain formation, we determined the distribution of SecA and SecY by immunofluorescent microscopy in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), which is an ovococcus species evolutionarily distant from S. pyogenes. In the majority (>/= 75%) of exponentially growing cells, S. pneumoniae SecA (SecA (Spn)) and SecY (Spn) located dynamically in cells at different stages of division. In early divisional cells, both Sec subunits concentrated at equators, which are future sites of constriction. Further along in division, SecA(Spn) and SecY(Spn) remained localized at mid-cell septa. In late divisional cells, both Sec subunits were hemispherically distributed in the regions between septa and the future equators of dividing cells. In contrast, the HtrA (Spn) homologue localized to the equators and septa of most (> 90%) dividing cells, whereas the SrtA(Spn) sortase located over the surface of cells in no discernable pattern. This dynamic pattern of Sec distribution was not perturbed by the absence of flotillin family proteins, but was largely absent in most cells in early stationary phase and in cls mutants lacking cardiolipin synthase. These results do not support the existence of an ExPortal microdomain in S. pneumoniae. Instead, the localization of the pneumococcal Sec translocase depends on the stage of cell division and anionic phospholipid content. IMPORTANCE: Two patterns of Sec translocase distribution, an ExPortal microdomain in certain ovococcus-shaped species like Streptococcus pyogenes and a spiral pattern in rod-shaped species like Bacillus subtilis, have been reported for Gram-positive bacteria. This study provides evidence for a third pattern of Sec localization in the ovococcus human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. The SecA motor and SecY channel subunits of the Sec translocase localize dynamically to different places in the mid-cell region during the division cycle of exponentially growing, but not stationary-phase, S. pneumoniae. Unexpectedly, the S. pneumoniae HtrA (HtrA(Spn)) protease/chaperone principally localizes to cell equators and division septa. The coincident localization of SecA(Spn), SecY (Spn), and HtrA (Spn) to regions of peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis in unstressed, growing cells suggests that the pneumococcal Sec translocase directs assembly of the PG biosynthesis apparatus to regions where it is needed during division and that HtrA(Spn) may play a general role in quality control of proteins exported by the Sec translocase.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine-5 -carboxylate derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a new series of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)-biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine- 5-carboxylate derivatives was synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by (1) H-NMR, mass and C, H, N analyses. All newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and antifungal (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Penicillium marneffei and Trichophyton mentagrophytes) activity. The results revealed that all synthesized compounds have a significant biological activity against the tested microorganisms. Compounds 8a, 8b, 8c, 8e, 8f, 8i, and 8j exhibited good antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Invasive bacterial infections following influenza: a time-series analysis in Montreal, Canada, 1996-2008.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shared seasonal patterns, such as between influenza and some respiratory bacterial infections, can create associations between phenomena not causally related. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association of influenza with subsequent bacterial infections after full adjustment for confounding by seasonal and long-term trends. METHODS: Time series of weekly counts of notified cases of invasive infections with Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, in Montreal, Canada, 1996-2008, were modelled by negative binomial regression, with terms representing seasonal and long-term trends and terms for numbers of positive laboratory tests for influenza A and B. RESULTS: The associations of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis with influenza disappeared after seasonal terms were added to the model. However, the influenza B count remained associated with the S. pyogenes counts for the same week and the following week: S. pyogenes incidence rate ratios were 1.0376 (95% CI: 1.0009-1.0757) and 1.0354 (0.9958-1.0766), respectively, for each increase of 1 in the influenza count. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza B accounts for about 8 percnt; of the incidence of invasive S. pyogenes infections, over and above any effect associated with modellable seasonal and long-term trends. This association of influenza B with S. pyogenes infections can be attributed largely to the years 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2008, when late peaks in influenza B counts were followed by peaks in S. pyogenes notifications. This finding reinforces the case for universal immunization against influenza, as partial protection against the 'flesh eating disease'.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Structural differences between the Streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: SrtA and SrtC1.
AB  - The assembly of pili on the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. In Streptococcus agalactiae, the PI-1 pilus island of strain 2603V/R encodes two pilus-specific sortases (SrtC1 and SrtC2) and three pilins (GBS80, GBS52 and GBS104). Although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, GBS80, incorporation of the minor pilins GBS52 and GBS104 into the pilus structure requires SrtC1 and SrtC2, respectively. The S. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, SrtA, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. To understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of S. agalactiae SrtC1 and SrtA. Both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. SrtA exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA but different from that in Staphylococcus aureus SrtA. In contrast, the SrtC1 enzyme contains an N-terminal helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that seen in Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. To understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a SrtC1 mutant, in which the conserved DP(W/F/Y) motif was replaced with the sorting signal motif of GBS80, IPNTG. By comparing the structures of WT wild type SrtA and SrtC1 and the 'lid' mutant of SrtC1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Spontaneously draining acute otitis media in children: an observational study of  clinical findings, microbiology and clinical course.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the outcome of acute otitis media (AOM) with otorrhoea in children managed initially without antibiotics, in relation to bacterial and clinical findings, and to identify those who may benefit from antibiotics. METHODS: Otherwise healthy, not otitis prone children aged 2-16 y, presenting with AOM with spontaneous otorrhoea, were recruited from primary care and followed at selected ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinics. Specimens for bacterial investigations were obtained; symptoms were registered on a daily basis. The main outcomes measured were the frequency of children treated with antibiotics due to persisting AOM within 9 days in relation to clinical and bacteriological findings, and new AOM within 3 months. RESULTS: Twelve of 71 children who completed the trial received antibiotics during the first 9 days due to lack of improvement. One received antibiotics after 16 days due to relapsing AOM and 6 received antibiotics after 30 days due to new AOM. At 2-4 days following inclusion, over 70% of children showed normalized eardrum status and markedly reduced secretion. Alloiococcus otitidis was found in 23 samples, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12, Streptococcus pyogenes in 6, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in 5. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Fusobacterium necrophorum were not detected. Antibiotics were prescribed more extensively to children with a pulsating eardrum and abundant purulent secretion. All children with S. pyogenes received antibiotics, whereas children with only A. otitidis did not. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that antibiotics are indicated in AOM with otorrhoea and the presence of abundant purulent secretion, a pulsating eardrum, or the presence of S. pyogenes. The presence of only A. otitidis was not associated with a more prolonged course or the need for antibiotics.
TI  - Establishment of the first international repository for transfusion-relevant bacteria reference strains: ISBT working party transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases (WP-TTID), subgroup on bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) still remains  a significant problem in transfusion with potential important clinical consequences, including death. The International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases, Subgroup on Bacteria, organised an international study on Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria References to be used as a tool for development, validation and comparison of both bacterial screening and pathogen reduction methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four Bacteria References (Staphylococcus epidermidis PEI-B-06, Streptococcus pyogenes PEI-B-20, Klebsiella pneumoniae PEI-B-08 and Escherichia coli PEI-B-19) were selected regarding their ability to proliferate to high counts in PCs and distributed anonymised to 14 laboratories in 10 countries for identification, enumeration and bacterial proliferation in PCs after low spiking (0.3 and 0.03 CFU/ml), to simulate contamination occurring during blood donation. RESULTS: Bacteria References were correctly identified in 98% of all 52 identifications. S. pyogenes and E. coli grew in PCs in 11 out of 12 laboratories, and K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis replicated in all participating laboratories. The results of bacterial counts were very consistent between laboratories: the 95% confidence intervals were for S. epidermidis: 1.19-1.32 x 10(7) CFU/ml, S. pyogenes: 0.58-0.69 x 10(7) CFU/ml, K. pneumoniae: 18.71-20.26 x 10(7) CFU/ml and E. coli: 1.78-2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: The study was undertaken as a proof of principle with the aim to demonstrate (i) the quality, stability and suitability of the bacterial strains for low-titre spiking of blood components, (ii) the property of donor-independent proliferation in PCs, and (iii) their suitability for worldwide shipping of deep frozen, blinded pathogenic bacteria. These aims were successfully fulfilled. The WHO Expert Committee Biological Standardisation has approved the adoption of these four bacteria strains as the first Repository for Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria Reference Strains and, additionally, endorsed as a project the addition of six further bacteria strain preparations suitable for control of platelet contamination as the next step of enlargement of the repository.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: 10 years experience in a French tertiary university referral center.
AB  - Acute mastoiditis have been increasingly reported in the last decade, with bacteriologic modifications and new therapeutic guidelines. This study is a retrospective review of 36 children hospitalized for acute mastoiditis in a French tertiary university referral center from 1999 to 2009, to assess incidence, bacteriology of pathogens and management. There were 10 periosteitis and 26 subperiosteal abscesses. There was a trend toward increased incidence over the past 10 years. The mean age of the patients was 31.8 months. A total of 63.2% children received 7.2 days antibiotic prior to hospitalization for acute otitis media, with sensitive pathogens in 80%. The pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (36.1%), S. pyogenes A (13.9%), Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%), Fusobacterium necroforum (8.3%) and Haemophiluss influenzae (2.8%). Cultures were negative in 16.7%. All patients received intravenous antibiotics. Eleven patients underwent bilateral myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tubes. Mastoidectomy was performed in 24 patients. Decrease in the length of hospitalization and delay from admission to surgery were significantly correlated. We observed a trend in the increase of acute mastoiditis at our center. The pathogens were dominated by S. pneumoniae. F. necroforum and P. aerguginosae were pathogens found in children over 2 years of age. Mastoidectomy was performed in 92.3% of subperiostal abscesses. However, there has been a trend toward conservative nonsurgical treatment in recent reported studies and further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term sequelae.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Incidence and severity of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus, and group B Streptococcus infections among pregnant and postpartum women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of streptococcal infection in pregnant and postpartum women is poorly described in recent literature. We used data from multistate surveillance for invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus (GAS), and group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections to estimate disease incidence and severity in these populations. METHODS: Cases were reported through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Active Bacterial Core surveillance, an active population- and laboratory-based system. A case was defined as illness in a woman aged 15-44 years with streptococcus isolated from a normally sterile body site during 2007-2009. Pregnant or postpartum status was recorded at the time of culture. Incidence was calculated as cases per 1000 woman-years with use of national Census data; 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of lambda distribution. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between pregnant or postpartum status and hospital length of stay, a marker of disease severity. RESULTS: We identified 1848 cases in women; 6.0% of women were pregnant, and 7.5% were postpartum. Pregnant women had a higher mean incidence of GBS disease, compared with nonpregnant women (0.04 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.03-0.05 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.02-0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years]). Postpartum women had elevated mean incidence of all 3 pathogens, compared with nonpregnant women (S. pneumoniae: 0.15 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.09-0.25 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.052 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.049-0.056 cases per 1000 woman-years]; GAS: 0.56 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.42-0.70 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.019 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.017-0.021 cases per 1000 woman-years]; GBS: 0.49 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.36-0.64 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.018 [range, 0.016-0.020 cases per 1000 woman-years]). Neither pregnancy nor postpartum status was associated with longer length of stay among women infected with any of the 3 pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Although invasive streptococcal infections do not appear to be more severe in pregnant or postpartum women, postpartum women have a 20-fold increased incidence of GAS and GBS, compared with nonpregnant women.
TI  - Population biology of Gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and S. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. Population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force of genetic diversity in E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. Although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of S. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. In this review, we discuss the population genetics of E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial effects of polyphenolic compounds from olive mill wastewater.
AB  - Polyphenols or phenolic compounds are groups of secondary metabolites widely distributed in plants and found in olive mill wastewater (OMW). Phenolic compounds as well as OMW extracts were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Most of the tested phenols were not effective against the four bacterial strains when tested as single compounds at concentrations of up to 1000 mug mL(-1). Hydroxytyrosol at 400 mug mL(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. Gallic acid was effective at 200, and 400 mug mL(-1) against S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, respectively, but not against the gram negative bacteria. An OMW fraction called AntiSolvent was obtained after the addition of ethanol to the crude OMW. HPLC analysis of AntiSolvent fraction revealed that this fraction contains mainly hydroxytyrosol (10.3%), verbascoside (7.4%), and tyrosol (2.6%). The combinations of AntiSolvent/gallic acid were tested using the low minimal inhibitory concentrations which revealed that 50/100-100/100 mug mL(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. These results suggest that OMW specific fractions augmented with natural phenolic ingredients may be utilized as a source of bioactive compounds to control pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial virulence in the moonlight: multitasking bacterial moonlighting proteins are virulence determinants in infectious disease.
AB  - Men may not be able to multitask, but it is emerging that proteins can. This capacity of proteins to exhibit more than one function is termed protein moonlighting, and, surprisingly, many highly conserved proteins involved in metabolic regulation or the cell stress response have a range of additional biological actions which are involved in bacterial virulence. This review highlights the multiple roles exhibited by a range of bacterial proteins, such as glycolytic and other metabolic enzymes and molecular chaperones, and the role that such moonlighting activity plays in the virulence characteristics of a number of important human pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Discovery of 4''-ether linked azithromycin-quinolone hybrid series: influence of  the central linker on the antibacterial activity.
AB  - A series of novel C-4''-substituted azithromycins was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of representative erythromycin-susceptible and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistant pathogens. In summary, azithromycin and quinolone substructures merged in a mutually SAR-compatible design gave rise to a new class of antimicrobials with an improved spectrum and potency over azithromycin. Prototypical analogues 7f and 8f display an improved potency versus azithromycin against Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens. In particular, these new leads maintain activity against MLS-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, they represent an improvement over telithromycin (1) and cethromycin (2) against the fastidious Gram-negative pathogen Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance evaluation of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for 1044 strains: 610 Staphylococcus aureus (352 from patients, 258 from carriers), 203 Streptococcus pneumoniae (53 from patients, 150 from carriers), 144 Enterococcus faecalis. 57 Enterococcus faecium and 30 Streptococcus spp. using automatic systems Vitek 2 Compact. MicroScan, disc diffusion method and Etest according to 2008 CLSI. A number of 497 Streptococcus pyogenes strains were tested for eritromycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 33.2% MRSA for strains isolated from patients and 30.0% from carriers. From MRSA strains. 35.5% were resistant to gentamicin. 33.6% to ciprofloxacin, 74.3% to erythromycin and 30.5% to rifampin. There were no S. aureus strain resistant to vancomycin and linezolid. S. aureus strains isolated from wounds were more resistant to erythromycin (43.9%) than the strains isolated from systemic infections (12.1%). From 11 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from meningitis, 4 were resistant to penicillin. Neither S. pneumoniae strain isolated from other infections, nor those from carriers had MIC to penicillin more than 4 microg/ml. S. pneumoniae strains isolated from carriers were more resistant to erythromycin. clindamycin and tetracycline than the strains isolated from patients (66.7%, 54.1%, 54.2% vs. 27.4%, 22.6%, 33.9%). E. faecium was 95.9% resistant to penicillin, 90.2% to ampicillin, 64.7% to gentamicin, 72.0% to streptomycin and 78.4% to ciprofloxacin. F. faecalis was less resistant than E. faecium at most of the antibiotics: 32.4% to gentamicin, 59.6% to streptomycin, 28.5% to ciprofloxacin. Viridans group Streptococci, all isolated from blood culture were 92% susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. To erythromycin, 12% of viridians group Streptococci were resistant. S. pyogenes resistance to eritromycin was 5.8%. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus strains showed a relatively high level of resistance to oxacillin (33.2%) and resistance in the same time to several antibiotics. S. pneumoniae can not be considered resistant to penicillin administrated parenteral, with exception of the strains isolated from meningitis. E. faecium had a higher resistance rate than E. faecalis.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes in  1996-2009].
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze trends in the resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin and macrolides and of S. pyogenes to macrolides over a 14-year period and to determine serotypes and molecular characteristics in a selected group of S. pneumoniae strains resistant to these antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Susceptibility to antibiotics was tested by the participating laboratories by the disk diffusion method in isolates of both bacterial species from the lower and upper respiratory tract from 1996-2009. The National Reference Laboratory for Antibiotics (NRL/ATB) determined the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin and erythromycin for invasive pneumococcal isolates from 2000-2009 and performed multilocus sequence analysis of selected resistant strains. RESULTS: Over the 14-year period monitored, penicillin resistance of S. pneumoniae isolates from the upper and lower respiratory tract showed a slightly downward trend similarly to blood isolates monitored since 2000. Resistance to macrolides in S. pneumoniae isolates was lower than penicillin resistance, regardless of the sample origin until 2005, but became higher than penicillin resistance in 2006 to follow a continuously upward trend since then. In 2009, the penicillin resistance rates of S. pneumoniae isolates from the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract and blood were 3.5%, 5.1% and 4.7%, respectively, while the respective erythromycin resistance rates reached 8.4%, 12.2% and 5.5%. When using the new clinical breakpoints for pneumococci from pneumonia cases depending on penicillin dose and administration interval, only two (0.1%) of 1528 strains from the blood were confirmed as penicillin resistant (MIC 4 mg/l). Resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides, reported in 16.5% of strains in 2001, sharply decreased to 9% in 2003 as a result of an intervention to promote the use of penicillin for the treatment of tonsillopharyngitis, and reached 11.1% in 2009. Among penicillin resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, the spread of clone Spain9V-3 (ST156) was confirmed, and among S. pneumoniae strains resistant to erythromycin alone, the spread of clones Poland6B-20 (ST315) and England9V-14 (ST9) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The favourable low prevalence of penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae strains, which in addition is negligible in the light of the new clinical breakpoints for penicillin resistance in strains from patients with pneumonia, contrasts with the ever increasing resistance of this species to macrolides. The highest rates of resistance to macrolides found in the strains isolated mainly from the sputum of adult patients confirm the preference for macrolides over the drugs of choice amoxicillin or penicillin G in the treatment of adults with pneumococcal pneumonia. Further spread of successful multiresistant clones of S. pneumoniae, the presence of which has been revealed in the Czech Republic, can only be prevented by a radical reduction in overuse or misuse of antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of modithromycin against streptococci and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of modithromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae were examined. METHODS: MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. Experimental infection of epithelial cell line A549 was performed to compare the intracellular activity and lasting effects of the antimicrobial agents. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, the rat pulmonary infection model was used. RESULTS: Modithromycin had MICs of </= 1 mg/L against all the clinical strains of both streptococci, including erythromycin-resistant strains. In particular, the MICs of modithromycin for erm(B)- or mef(A)-carrying S. pyogenes were 16-32 times or 2-4 times lower than those of telithromycin, respectively. The MIC(90) of modithromycin for H. influenzae was 8 mg/L, which was 4 times higher than that of telithromycin. Modithromycin, as well as azithromycin, showed a lasting inhibitory effect on bacterial growth of cell-associated H. influenzae compared with telithromycin and levofloxacin after removal of the agents from the apical medium. In the pulmonary infection model, modithromycin showed greater or comparable efficacy against erm(B)-carrying S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively, than telithromycin, regardless of having an MIC that was 2 or 4 times higher for these strains. CONCLUSIONS: Modithromycin has the most potent anti-S. pyogenes activity of the antimicrobial agents tested. Modithromycin also has the better in vivo efficacy against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, which might be due to its lasting intracellular activity.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil: a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil, the prodrug of the active metabolite, ceftaroline, is a new, broad-spectrum cephalosporin recently approved in the USA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Ceftaroline has potent in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common Gram-negative organisms. The high affinity of ceftaroline for penicillin-binding proteins is responsible for the potent activity observed against clinically relevant pathogens. With respect to the treatment of CABP, the activity of ceftaroline against pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis demonstrates coverage across a broad range of pathogens typically encountered in clinical practice. Ceftaroline is also very active against common pathogens seen in ABSSSIs such as S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes. Ceftaroline exhibits a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile, similar to other renally excreted cephalosporins, and has a well-tolerated safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class. Ceftaroline fosamil is compatible via Y-site administration with many other commonly administered parenteral drugs.
TI  - Bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of adult chronic dacryocystitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic dacryocystitis results in chronic infection and inflammation of the lacrimal sac. OBJECTIVE: To identify the aetiology of chronic dacryocystitis and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross - sectional study was undertaken including 120 lacrimal swab materials collected from patients aged above 15 years suffering from chronic dacryocystitis. STATISTICS: Data analysis was done by using software "Win pepi'' ver 7.9. RESULTS: The bacteria of eight different species were isolated from 76.66 % (92/120) culture positive samples. 85.86 % showed a single and 14.13 % showed a mixed growth pattern. Coagulase negative staphylococci were the most common bacteria (P= 0.018) accounting for 33.96 % followed by Staphylococcus aureus (25.46 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae ( 19.81 % ), Streptococci viridans (5.66 %), Escherichia coli (5.66 %), Haemophilus spp ( 4.71 % ), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.77 %) and Bacillus spp (0.94 % ). Staphylococcus aureus were the most predominant bacteria in mixed growth. Rate of infection was higher in males 81.39 % than in females 74.02 %. Infection was higher in the age group of above 31 years. In the antimicrobial susceptibility test, except staphylococcus aureus, all the Gram positive isolates were 100 % sensitive to chloramphenicol and were least sensitive to tobramycin, but Gram negative isolates were equally sensitive to Chloramphenicol and Nalidixic acid. CONCLUSION: Coagulase negative staphylococci are the most frequently isolated bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus is predominantly found in mixed growth. Chloramphenicol is the most effective drug of choice for chronic dacryocystitis.
TI  - Genetic resistance elements carrying mef subclasses other than mef(A) in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - In Streptococcus pyogenes, efflux-mediated erythromycin resistance is associated  with the mef gene, represented mostly by mef(A), although a small portion of strains carry different mef subclasses. We characterized the composite genetic elements, including mef subclasses other than mef(A), associated with other resistance genes in S. pyogenes isolates. Determination of the genetic elements was performed by PCR mapping. The strains carrying mosaic mef(A/E), in which the 5' region was identical to mef(A) and the 3' region was identical to mef(E), also carried tet(O). The two genes were found enclosed in an element similar to S. pyogenes prophage Phim46.1, designated the Phim46.1-like element. In S. pyogenes strains carrying mef(E) and tet(M), mef(E) was included in a typical mega element, and in some strains, it was physically associated with tet(M) in the composite element Tn2009. S. pyogenes strains carrying mef(I) also carried catQ; the two genes were linked in a fragment representing a portion of the 5216IQ complex of Streptococcus pneumoniae, designated the defective IQ element. In the only isolate carrying a novel mef gene, this was associated with catQ and tet(M) in a genetic element similar to the 5216IQ complex of S. pneumoniae (5216IQ-like complex), suggesting that the novel mef is in fact a variant of mef(I). This study demonstrates that the composite elements containing mef are shared between S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae and suggests that it is important to distinguish the mef subclass on the basis of the genetic element containing it.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala (Asteraceae).
AB  - Some Vernonia species (Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala) used in Northern Nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. The antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the NCCLS was carried out on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysentriae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas fluorescence. The results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the Vernonia species being studied. The activity of chloroform fraction of V. blumeoides was higher on C. ulcerans and K. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of V. oocephala and V. ambigua were more active on P. mirabilis (27 mm) and S. typhi (22 mm), respectively. It is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three Vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The MIC of 1.25 mg/mL exhibited by the chloroform fractions on both Gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the Vernonia species being studied. Phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. The antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. The overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. This lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
TI  - Inactivated and live, attenuated influenza vaccines protect mice against influenza: Streptococcus pyogenes super-infections.
AB  - Mortality associated with influenza virus super-infections is frequently due to secondary bacterial complications. To date, super-infections with Streptococcus pyogenes have been studied less extensively than those associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is significant because a vaccine for S. pyogenes is not clinically available, leaving vaccination against influenza virus as our only means for preventing these super-infections. In this study, we directly compared immunity induced by two types of influenza vaccine, either inactivated influenza virus (IIV) or live, attenuated influenza virus (LAIV), for the ability to prevent super-infections. Our data demonstrate that both IIV and LAIV vaccines induce similar levels of serum antibodies, and that LAIV alone induces IgA expression at mucosal surfaces. Upon super-infection, both vaccines have the ability to limit the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the lung, including IFN-gamma which has been shown to contribute to mortality in previous models of super-infection. Limiting expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines within the lungs subsequently limits recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils to pulmonary surfaces, and ultimately protects both IIV- and LAIV-vaccinated mice from mortality. Despite their overall survival, both IIV- and LAIV-vaccinated mice demonstrated levels of bacteria within the lung tissue that are similar to those seen in unvaccinated mice. Thus, influenza virus:bacteria super-infections can be limited by vaccine-induced immunity against influenza virus, but the ability to prevent morbidity is not complete.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2009].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2009, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms was available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.06 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was equal to that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 2 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 8 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/mL and were 1 to 2 times lower than those of GRNX, 2 to 4 times lower than those of MFLX, and 16 to 32 times lower than those of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.25 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 2 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for E. coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90s of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 8 microg/mL and was 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 2 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 16 times lower than that of LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 2 to 4 times lower than those of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX, and 4 times lower than those of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.008 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.015 to 0.12 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - mef(A) is the predominant macrolide resistance determinant in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes in Germany.
AB  - In this study, macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from Germany were carefully characterised by susceptibility testing, phenotyping, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of macrolides resistance genes, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Of 2045 S. pneumoniae and 352 S. pyogenes isolates, 437 (21.4%) and 29 (8.2%), respectively, were found to be macrolide-resistant. Amongst the S. pneumoniae isolates, the most prevalent resistance marker was mef(A) (57.7%) followed by erm(B) (27.0%) and mef(E) (11.2%). Of note, the dual resistance mechanism mef(E)+erm(B) was found in a relatively high proportion (4.1%) of pneumococcal isolates. Amongst the S. pyogenes isolates, 31.0% carried mef(A), 34.5% erm(B) and 13.8% erm(A). Dissemination of a single clone [mef(A)-positive England(14)-9] has significantly contributed to the emergence of macrolide resistance amongst pneumococci in Germany.

AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2008: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens collected from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted a third year of nationwide surveillance during the period from January to April 2008. A total of 1,097 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 987 strains (189 Staphylococcus aureus, 211 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 187 Haemophilus influenzae, 106 Moraxella catarrhalis, 126 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 162 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including a ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 59.8%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 35.5 and 11.8%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 13.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 26.7% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.3% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5%) of beta-lactamase-producing strains was suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5%) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9%) suspected multidrug-resistant strains showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continual national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  - Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. The most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis. Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.
TI  - Confirmation of HIV-like sequences in respiratory tract bacteria of Cambodian and Kenyan HIV-positive pediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and yeasts isolated from respiratory tracts of 39 Cambodian  and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children were tested for the presence of HIV-1 sequences. MATERIAL/METHODS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract (nose, pharyngeal swabs) were isolated from 39 Cambodian and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children. Bacterial chromosomal DNA was prepared by standard protocol and by Qiagen kit. The PCR specific for HIV sequences was carried out using HIV-1-specific primers.The analysis was performed by colony and dot-blot hybridization using HIV-1-specific primers which represent gag, pol and env genes of the virus. The sequencing of some PCR products was performed on the ABI 373 DNA Sequencer. RESULTS: The majority of microbes were characterized as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and resp. Candida albicans. In some cases E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Candida tropicalis were identified. Bacteria of 16 Cambodian (41%) and 8 Kenyan (31%) children were found to be positive in colony and dot-blot DNA hybridization. By the sequencing of PCR products synthesized on the template of patients' bacterial DNA using primers 68;69 for env HIV-1 gene, homology of greater than 90% with HIV-1 isolate HXB2 (HIVHXB2CG) was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract of 41% of Cambodian and 31% of Kenyan HIV-positive children bear HIV-like sequences. The role of bacteria in the HIV disease process is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of dalbavancin and telavancin against staphylococci and streptococci isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - Two novel lipoglycopeptides, dalbavancin and telavancin, and relevant comparative agents were tested for in vitro activity against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci collected in the cross-Canada surveillance study, CANWARD, in 2007-2009. The rank order of potency (based on MIC(90) [mug/mL], i.e., the concentration of antimicrobial agent required to inhibit the growth of 90% of isolates tested) of glycopeptides against both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was dalbavancin (0.06 mug/mL) >telavancin (0.5 mug/mL) > vancomycin (1-2 mug/mL); concurrent susceptibility or resistance to oxacillin in staphylococci did not affect potency of glycopeptides. Dalbavancin and telavancin also demonstrated potent activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates (MIC(90), </= 0.03 mug/mL; </= 0.06 mug/mL), and Streptococcus pyogenes (</= 0.03 mug/mL; 0.06 mug/mL). Based on their robust in vitro activities, dalbavancin and telavancin have the potential to treat Gram-positive infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative isolates. This study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis with elevated MICs. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). No streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased MICs (defined as an increase in MIC of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. Ceftaroline MICs for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive H. influenzae with a mutation in L22. One H. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline MIC (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. The ceftaroline MIC for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. MICs for S. aureus ranged from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. No S. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased MIC (>4-fold) after 50 passages. Two E. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline MICs increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32 mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. The parental ceftaroline MIC for the one K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.
TI  - Two distinct genetic elements are responsible for erm(TR)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible and tetracycline-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - In Streptococcus pyogenes, inducible erythromycin (ERY) resistance is due to posttranscriptional methylation of an adenine residue in 23S rRNA that can be encoded either by the erm(B) gene or by the more recently described erm(TR) gene. Two erm(TR)-carrying genetic elements, showing extensive DNA identities, have thus far been sequenced: ICE10750-RD.2 ( approximately 49 kb) and Tn1806 ( approximately 54 kb), from tetracycline (TET)-susceptible strains of S. pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. However, TET resistance, commonly mediated by the tet(O) gene, is widespread in erm(TR)-positive S. pyogenes. In this study, 23 S. pyogenes clinical strains with erm(TR)-mediated ERY resistance-3 TET susceptible and 20 TET resistant-were investigated. Two erm(TR)-carrying elements sharing only a short, high-identity erm(TR)-containing core sequence were comprehensively characterized: ICESp1108 (45,456 bp) from the TET-susceptible strain C1 and ICESp2905 (65,575 bp) from the TET-resistant strain iB21. While ICESp1108 exhibited extensive identities to ICE10750-RD.2 and Tn1806, ICESp2905 showed a previously unreported genetic organization resulting from the insertion of separate erm(TR)- and tet(O)-containing fragments in a scaffold of clostridial origin. Transferability by conjugation of the erm(TR) elements from the same strains used in this study had been demonstrated in earlier investigations. Unlike ICE10750-RD.2 and Tn1806, which are integrated into an hsdM chromosomal gene, both ICESp1108 and ICESp2905 shared the chromosomal integration site at the 3' end of the conserved rum gene, which is an integration hot spot for several mobile streptococcal elements. By using PCR-mapping assays, erm(TR)-carrying elements closely resembling ICESp1108 and ICESp2905 were shown in the other TET-susceptible and TET-resistant test strains, respectively.
TI  - Cefditoren in upper and lower community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - This article reviews and updates published data on cefditoren in the evolving scenario of resistance among the most prevalent isolates from respiratory tract infections in the community (Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). By relating the in vitro activity of cefditoren (in national and multinational surveillance and against isolates with emerging resistant genotypes/phenotypes) to its pharmacokinetics, the cefditoren pharmacodynamic activity predicting efficacy (in humans, animal models, and in vitro simulations) is analyzed prior to reviewing clinical studies (tonsillopharyngitis, sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia) and the relationship between bacterial eradication and clinical efficacy. The high in vitro activity of cefditoren against the most prevalent respiratory isolates in the community, together with its pharmacokinetics (enabling a twice daily regimen) leading to adequate pharmacodynamic indexes covering all S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, and at least 95% S. pneumoniae isolates, makes cefditoren an antibiotic that will play a significant role in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in the community. In the clinical setting, studies carried out with cefditoren showed that treatments with the 400 mg twice daily regimen were associated with high rates of bacteriological response, even against penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae, with good correlation between bacteriological efficacy/response and clinical outcome.
TI  - Increase in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in England, December 2010 to January 2011.
AB  - Increases in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae above the seasonally expected levels are currently being seen in England. Preliminary analyses suggest that the high level of influenza activity seen this winter may be contributing to an increased risk of concurrent invasive bacterial and influenza infections in children and young adults.
TI  - Etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in Korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent Korean children. We retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. A total of 768 cases were identified. S. agalactiae (48.1%) and S. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. S. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. S. pneumoniae (45.3%) and H. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr. S. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. S. aureus (50.6%), Salmonella species (16.9%), and S. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. A significant decline in H. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in Korean children.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of a serotype 11A, ST62 Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We sequenced the genome of a serotype 11A, ST62 S. pneumoniae invasive isolate (AP200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(TR) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. RESULTS: The genome sequence of S. pneumoniae AP200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. The genome carries 2216 coding sequences (CDS), 56 tRNA, and 12 rRNA genes. Of the CDSs, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. AP200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11A, it contains an 11D capsular locus. Chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and horizontal gene transfer events were observed. The chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(TR)-carrying Tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phiSpn_200. Tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 ORFs. Comparative analysis of Tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as Streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species Finegoldia magna, Anaerococcus prevotii and Clostridium difficile. The genome of phiSpn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 ORFs grouped into five functional modules. Prophages similar to phiSpn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phiSpn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the Siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of S. pneumoniae AP200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. The overall diversity of AP200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements Tn1806 and phiSpn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic elements of different bacterial species. These genetic elements likely provide AP200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of new 4''-O-carbamates of 11,12-cyclic carbonate erythromycin A 6,9-imino ether.
AB  - A series of new 4''-O-carbamates of 11,12-cyclic carbonate erythromycin A 6,9-imino ether were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity. All the desired compounds demonstrated favorable activity (0.03 mug ml(-1)) against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae comparable to the references, exhibiting 133-fold higher activity than precursor 2 or 3. Similarly, all of the analogs exhibited improved activity against the erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene and the erm and mef genes, showing 4-32-fold more effectiveness than erythromycin A.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of modithromycin, a novel 6,11-bridged bicyclolide, against respiratory pathogens, including macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of modithromycin against Gram-positive and -negative respiratory pathogens, including macrolide-resistant cocci with different resistance mechanisms, were compared with those of other macrolide and ketolide agents. MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. All 595 test strains used in this study were isolated from Japanese medical facilities. The erm (ribosome methylase) and/or mef (efflux pump) gene, which correlated with resistance to erythromycin as well as clarithromycin and azithromycin, was found in 81.8%, 21.3%, and 23.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, respectively. Modithromycin showed MIC(90)s of 0.125 mug/ml against these three cocci, including macrolide-resistant strains. In particular, the MIC of modithromycin against ermB-carrying S. pyogenes was >/= 32-fold lower than that of telithromycin. The activities of modithromycin as well as telithromycin were little affected by the presence of mefA or mefE in both streptococci. Against Gram-negative pathogens, modithromycin showed MIC(90)s of 0.5, 8, and 0.031 mug/ml against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Legionella spp., respectively. The MICs of modithromycin against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae were higher than those of telithromycin and azithromycin. However, modithromycin showed the most potent anti-Legionella activity among the macrolide and ketolide agents tested. These results suggested that the bicyclolide agent modithromycin is a novel class of macrolides with improved antibacterial activity against Gram-positive cocci, including telithromycin-resistant streptococci and intracellular Gram-negative bacteria of the Legionella species.
TI  - Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae as primary causes of acute otitis media in colombian children: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most frequently encountered bacterial infections in children aged < 5 years; Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) are historically identified as primary AOM causes. Nevertheless, recent data on bacterial pathogens causing AOM in Latin America are limited. This prospective study aimed to identify and characterize bacterial etiology and serotypes of AOM cases including antimicrobial susceptibility in < 5 year old Colombian children. METHODS: From February 2008 to January 2009, children >/=3 months and < 5 years of age presenting with AOM and for whom a middle ear fluid (MEF) sample was available were enrolled in two medical centers in Cali, Colombia. MEF samples were collected either by tympanocentesis procedure or spontaneous otorrhea swab sampling. Bacteria were identified using standard laboratory methods, and antimicrobial resistance testing was performed based on the 2009 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria. Most of the cases included in the study were sporadic in nature. RESULTS: Of the 106 enrolled children, 99 were included in the analysis. Bacteria were cultured from 62/99 (63%) of samples with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or S. pyogenes. The most commonly isolated bacteria were H. influenzae in 31/99 (31%) and S. pneumoniae in 30/99 (30%) of samples. The majority of H. influenzae episodes were NTHi (27/31; 87%). 19F was the most frequently isolated pneumococcal serotype (10/30; 33%). Of the 30 S. pneumoniae positive samples, 8/30 (27%) were resistant to tetracycline, 5/30 (17%) to erythromycin and 8/30 (27%) had intermediate resistance to penicillin. All H. influenzae isolates tested were negative to beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: NTHi and S. pneumoniae are the leading causes of AOM in Colombian children. A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that prevents both pathogens could be useful in maximizing protection against AOM.
TI  - Cellular interactions by LPxTG-anchored pneumococcal adhesins and their streptococcal homologues.
AB  - In this review we focus on three important families of LPxTG-anchored adhesins in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also their homologues in related streptococci. We discuss the contribution of these streptococcal adhesins to host tropism, pathogenesis and their interactions with different host cell types. The first surface structures discussed are the heteropolymeric pili that have been found in important streptococcal pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and E. faecalis/faecium. Major and minor pilus subunit proteins are covalently joined and finally attached to the cell wall through the action of specific sortases. The role of pili and individual pilin subunits in adhesion and pathogenesis and their structure and assembly in different streptococcal species are being covered. Furthermore, we address recent findings regarding a family of large glycosylated serine-rich repeat (SRR) proteins that act as fibrillar adhesins for which homologues have been found in several streptococcal species including pneumococci. In the pneumococcal genome both pili and its giant SRR protein are encoded by accessory genes present in particular clonal lineages for which epidemiological information is available. Finally, we briefly discuss the role played by the pneumococcal neuraminidase NanA in adhesion and pathogenesis.
TI  - Novel bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and antibacterial efficacy in vivo.
AB  - DNA ligases are indispensable enzymes playing a critical role in DNA replication, recombination, and repair in all living organisms. Bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) was evaluated for its potential as a broad-spectrum antibacterial target. A novel class of substituted adenosine analogs was discovered by target-based high-throughput screening (HTS), and these compounds were optimized to render them more effective and selective inhibitors of LigA. The adenosine analogs inhibited the LigA activities of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, with inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range. They were selective for bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, showing no inhibitory activity against ATP-dependent human DNA ligase 1 or bacteriophage T4 ligase. Enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with NAD+. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the adenosine analogs bind in the AMP-binding pocket of the LigA adenylation domain. Antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic Gram-positive and atypical bacteria, such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and M. pneumoniae, as well as against Gram-negative pathogens, such as H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The mode of action was verified using recombinant strains with altered LigA expression, an Okazaki fragment accumulation assay, and the isolation of resistant strains with ligA mutations. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine S. aureus thigh infection model and a murine S. pneumoniae lung infection model. Treatment with the adenosine analogs reduced the bacterial burden (expressed in CFU) in the corresponding infected organ tissue as much as 1,000-fold, thus validating LigA as a target for antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel clarithromycin derivatives with C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups against macrolide-resistant strains.
AB  - Novel clarithromycin derivatives with C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups were designed, synthesized and evaluated to probe the effect of different lengths of their C-4'' side chains on the activity against resistant bacterial strains. These derivatives had excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes and some of them exhibited greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant strains. Compounds 18 and 16, which had the C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups with eight atoms from the 4''-oxygen atom to the terminal benzene ring, were the most effective against S. pneumoniae expressing the erm gene and the erm and mef genes. In contrast, the most potent compounds 3, 5, 9, 17 and 18 against S. pneumoniae expressing the mef gene had C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups with three to eight atoms between the 4''-oxygen atom and the terminal aromatic ring.
TI  - Autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide bond formation in gram-positive bacterial pili: a QM/MM simulation.
AB  - Many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. Unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between Asn and Lys side chains within the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the Streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit Spy0128 and subsequently in GBS52 from Streptococcus agalactiae, in the BcpA major pilin of Bacillus cereus and in the RrgB pilin of Streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. Within each pilin subunit, intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. These bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. Genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. For the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including Asn, Lys, and a catalytically important acidic Glu (or Asp) residue are responsible. However, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. Although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as Spy0128 and RrgB. This suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. From this mechanistic perspective, we used the QM/MM minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with Spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. It was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on Cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated Lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia. More importantly, within the dual active sites of Spy0128, Glu(117), and Glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. This work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within Spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. Our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - HtpS, a novel immunogenic cell surface-exposed protein of Streptococcus suis, confers protection in mice.
AB  - Streptococcal histidine triad protein was identified recently as a cell surface-associated protein family. Five members of this family (PhtA, PhtB, PhtD, PhtE and HtpA), derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, have been shown as antigens that confer protection to the host on infection. In this report, a gene sequence highly homologous to htpA and phtD (designated htpS, the histidine triad protein of Streptococcus suis) was identified from S. suis 2 Chinese strain 05ZYH33. Our data revealed that htpS is extremely conserved in S. suis 2 and widely distributed in 83% (29/35) of 35 S. suis serotypes. It was also demonstrated by Western blot and flow cytometry that HtpS is a cell surface-associated protein that was expressed during S. suis 2 infection. An antibody against HtpS could increase the deposition of human complement 3 on S. suis 2 and also enhance the clearance of S. suis 2 in whole blood. In addition, mice could be immunized against S. suis 2 infection and were well protected after immunization with recombinant HtpS.
TI  - Phytochemical studies on Stemona aphylla: isolation of a new stemofoline alkaloid and six new stemofurans.
AB  - A new stemofoline alkaloid, (2'S)-hydroxy-(11S,12R)-dihydrostemofoline (3), new stemofurans M-R (8-13), and known compounds stemofoline (1), (2'S)-hydroxystemofoline (2), stemofuran E (4), stemofuran F (5), stemofuran J (6), and stilbostemin F (7) have been isolated from the root extracts of Stemona aphylla. The structures and relative configurations of these new compounds have been determined by spectroscopic data interpretation and from semisynthetic studies. These natural and semisynthetic alkaloids were tested for acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities and were found to be 10-20 times less active than 1',2'-didehydrostemofoline itself. Stemofurans 4, 6, 8, 11, and 13 were tested for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Three of these showed antibacterial activities against MRSA with MIC values of 15.6 mug/mL.
TI  - Genomic organization, structure, regulation and pathogenic role of pilus constituents in major pathogenic Streptococci and Enterococci.
AB  - Oligocomponent pilus structures, recently discovered in many important Gram-positive pathogens, represent a new class of virulence factors with adhesive and matrix protein-binding activity. Some of these proteins have emerged as very promising lead components of protein-based vaccines against Streptococci. These extended surface structures play key roles in host cell and tissue adherence, paracellular translocation, and biofilm formation of major Gram-positive pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae as well as in opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens like Enterococci. Here, we discuss the similarities and differences of: (1) the genomic organization of the various regions encoding pilus proteins, (2) the number, type, and assembly of the proteins constituting the pili, (3) their expression and regulation mechanisms, (4) their role in bacterial virulence, and (5) their potential as vaccine candidate antigens.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-aryl-[1,2,3]-triazole containing  macrolides.
AB  - Two series of novel triazole containing 14-member macrolides having either a cladinose or a 3-pyridyl acetate group at the 3-position of the macrolide ring were synthesized. The in vitro antibacterial activities against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis were determined. Macrolide 7a and the fluoroketolide 1 (CEM-101) were evaluated in vivo in murine systemic infection models. All of the macrolide analogs were less active in vitro and in vivo than the fluoroketolide 1 (CEM-101).
TI  - Investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly Japanese.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. We investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living Japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. Furthermore, the presence of occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. RESULTS: Oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. Those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). In addition, age was a significant factor for the presence of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - Molecular analysis improves pathogen identification and epidemiologic study of pediatric parapneumonic empyema.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parapneumonic empyema (PPE) is an increasingly common complication of bacterial pneumonia. Epidemiologic study is complicated by the low frequency of positive cultures. We sought to describe the epidemiology of PPE in children using molecular analysis of pleural fluid. METHODS: We performed molecular testing for bacterial pathogens using archived pleural fluid from children hospitalized in 2009 with PPE. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as PCR-based serotyping of S. pneumoniae was performed. Demographic, laboratory, and microbiologic data were abstracted. RESULTS: Pleural fluid specimens from 63 children were available for PCR. By culture, a pathogen was isolated from blood and/or pleural fluid in 22 (35%) patients, with S. pneumoniae in 15 (24%), S. pyogenes in 3 (5%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 4 (6%). By PCR, a pathogen was detected in 53 (84%), including S. pneumoniae in 45 (71%). Compared with culture, PCR testing significantly increased detection of any pathogen (35% vs. 84%; P < 0.001) and of S. pneumoniae (24% vs. 71%; P < 0.001). Serotype 7F was the most common pneumococcal serotype detected. Comparison of culture-negative to culture-positive disease showed differences in both the pathogen profile and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis of pleural fluid more than doubled the detection of pathogens causing PPE. S. pneumoniae was the most common cause of both culture-positive and culture-negative PPE, although serotype distribution and outcomes differed.
TI  - Phytochemical investigations of Stemona curtisii and synthetic studies on stemocurtisine alkaloids.
AB  - The isolation of two new Stemona alkaloids, 1-hydroxyprotostemonine and stemocurtisine N-oxide, and a new benzofuran, stemofuran L, from the root extracts of Stemona curtisii is reported. The major known alkaloids from this plant extract, stemocurtisine, stemocurtisinol, and oxyprotostemonine, were also isolated along with oxystemokerrine N-oxide. The nonalkaloid components of this extract included a new benzofuran derivative, stemofuran L, the known stemofurans F, J, and K, dihydro-gamma-tocopherol, and stigmasterol. Stemocurtisine and stemocurtisinol were converted to their respective N-oxides by oxidation. Stemocurtisine was converted to a tetracyclic derivative by oxidative cleavage of the gamma-butyrolactone ring, while stemocurtisinol gave a novel lactam derivative by oxidative cleavage of the C-4 side chain under basic conditions. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of some known and new alkaloids and their derivatives are also reported. All were 10-20 times less active as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors than the pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine Stemona alkaloids stemofoline and 1',2'-didehydrostemofoline. None of the stemofuran compounds showed significant antibacterial or antifungal activities.
TI  - Co-infection of Influenza B and Streptococci causing severe pneumonia and septic  shock in healthy women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the Influenza A pandemic in 1819, the association between the influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae has been well described in literature. While a leading role has been so far attributed solely to Influenza A as the primary infective pathogen, Influenza B is generally considered to be less pathogenic with little impact on morbidity and mortality of otherwise healthy adults. This report documents the severe synergistic pathogenesis of Influenza B infection and bacterial pneumonia in previously healthy persons not belonging to a special risk population and outlines therapeutic options in this clinical setting. CASE PRESENTATION: During the seasonal influenza epidemic 2007/2008, three previously healthy women presented to our hospital with influenza-like symptoms and rapid clinical deterioration. Subsequent septic shock due to severe bilateral pneumonia necessitated intensive resuscitative measures including the use of an interventional lung assist device. Microbiological analysis identified severe dual infections of Influenza B with Streptococcus pyogenes in two cases and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one case. The patients presented with no evidence of underlying disease or other known risk factors for dual infection such as age (< one year, > 65 years), pregnancy or comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza B infection can pose a risk for severe secondary infection in previously healthy persons. As patients admitted to hospital due to severe pneumonia are rarely tested for Influenza B, the incidence of admission due to this virus might be greatly underestimated, therefore, a more aggressive search for influenza virus and empirical treatment might be warranted. While the use of an interventional lung assist device offers a potential treatment strategy for refractory respiratory acidosis in addition to protective lung ventilation, the combined empiric use of a neuraminidase-inhibitor and antibiotics in septic patients with pulmonary manifestations during an epidemic season should be considered.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: a retrospective study of 188 patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to define the clinical and bacteriological characteristics of acute mastoiditis (AM) in children in order to optimize diagnostic work-up and treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 188 children between 3 months and 15 years of age (15+/-24 months; median+/-SD) were referred to our pediatric ENT emergency center for AM during a 7-year period (December 2001-January 2008). RESULTS: Fifty seven percent were male and 43% were female. Clinical follow-up duration was 3.9+/-0.7 months (mean+/-SEM). The incidence of AM remained stable during the whole study period. Microbiological samples (n=236) were negative in 33% of cases. The most frequently isolated germs were Streptococcus pneumoniae (51%), Streptococcus pyogenes (11.5%), Anaerobes (6.5%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (6.5%). Paracentesis, puncture of retro auricular abscess under local anesthesia, and peroperative samples all contributed to isolate the involved germ(s). All the patients were hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics, and 36.2% (n=68) underwent surgery. Several surgical procedures were necessary in 4 cases (2.1%). AM recurrences requiring a second hospitalization were observed in 8 patients (4.3%). The only observed complication was lateral sinus thrombosis (n=6; 3.2%). Surgical failures, requiring more than one surgical procedure, were more frequent in case of: (i) presence of Anaerobes (p</=0.001) or Gram-negative bacteria (p</=0.05) in microbiological samples; (ii) surgical drainage without mastoidectomy (p</=0.001). Recurrences were more frequent in AM due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings and on literature data, a protocol was established in order to standardize the management of pediatric AM in our center. The mains points are: no systematic surgery; if surgery is indicated, it must encompass a mastoidectomy; broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic treatment covering the most commonly involved germs (3rd generation cephalosporin) and secondarily adapted to the results of microbiological samples. If the infection is not controlled after 48 h of intravenous antibiotherapy, a mastoidectomy had to be performed.
TI  - Solvent-free microwave extraction and hydrodistillation of essential oils from endemic Origanum husnucanbaseri H. Duman, Aytac & A. Duran: comparison of antibacterial activity and contents.
AB  - The essential oils (EOs) obtained by solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and hydrodistillation (HD) from endemic Origanum husnucanbaseri H. Duman, Aytac & A. Duran were investigated using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. The main constituents of both oils obtained from SFME and HD from O. husnucanbaseri are borneol (15.2-12.8%), alpha-terpineol (12.3-10.8%) and trans-sabinene hydrate (11.8-9.92%). The EO obtained from SFME contained substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes than that from HD. The antibacterial activities of the EOs from SFME and HD were evaluated by the disc diffusion method against six bacterial strains. The EO extracted by SFME was more effective than the EO extracted by HD against the tested bacteria, except for Klebsiella pneumoniae American type culture collection (ATCC) 13883. Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 in particular were more sensitive against the EO extracted by SFME.
TI  - Vitronectin in bacterial pathogenesis: a host protein used in complement escape and cellular invasion.
AB  - The multifunctional human glycoprotein vitronectin (Vn) plays a significant role  in cell migration, tissue repair and regulation of membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. It also promotes neutrophil infiltration and, thus, enhances the inflammatory process during infection. In the host, a balanced homeostasis is maintained by Vn due to neutralization of the self-reactivity of the MAC. On the other hand, Vn bound to the bacterial surface protects from MAC-mediated lysis and enhances adhesion. Gram-negative bacterial pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae use Vn recruitment to prevent MAC deposition at their surface. Moreover, Gram-positive bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes utilize Vn for effective adhesion to host cells and subsequent internalization. Vitronectin has an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence for binding the host cell integrin receptors and a separate bacterial-binding domain for pathogens, and thus more likely functions to cross-link bacteria and epithelial cells. Once bacteria are attached to the vitronectin-integrin complex, various host cell-signalling events are activated and promote internalization. In this review, we focus on the important roles of vitronectin in bacterial pathogenesis and describe different strategies used by pathogens to evade the host response by the help of this intriguing molecule.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4''-O-carbamoyl erythromycin-A derivatives.
AB  - Novel 4''-O-carbamoyl erythromycin-A derivatives were designed, synthesized, and  evaluated for their in-vitro antibacterial activities. All of the 4''-O-carbamoyl derivatives showed excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC49619. Most of the 4''-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl derivatives displayed potent activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene and greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene or the erm and mef genes. In particular, the 4''-O-arylalkyl derivatives 4c-4e and 4g were found to possess the most potent activity against all the tested erythromycin-susceptible strains, which were comparable to those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin. 4''-O-Arylalkyl derivatives 4e and 4g were the most effective against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene (0.25 and 0.25 microg/mL). 4''-O-Arylalkyl derivatives 4a and 4b exhibited significantly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene. In contrast, the 4''-O-alkylcarbamoyl derivatives hardly showed improved activity against all the tested erythromycin-resistant strains.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 13C, 15N NMR assignments of the unliganded and substrate ternary complex forms of mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyzes the ATP-dependent decarboxylation of diphosphomevalonate (DPM) to produce isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), the molecular "building block" for more than 25,000 distinct isoprenoids, including cholesterol, steroid hormones and terpenoids. Here, we present the first backbone assignment of Streptococcus pneumoniae MDD in the unliganded state and in a ternary complex with DPM and AMPPCP--a nucleotide analogue unable to transfer the gamma-phosphoryl group. The secondary chemical shifts for the unliganded form are in good agreement with the crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes (~70% sequence identity). The addition of substrate and nucleotide to the enzyme results in chemical shift changes of cross peaks that correspond to residues in the binding pocket.
TI  - A highly unusual thioester bond in a pilus adhesin is required for efficient host cell interaction.
AB  - Many bacterial pathogens present adhesins at the tips of long macromolecular filaments known as pili that are often important virulence determinants. Very little is known about how pili presented by Gram-positive pathogens mediate host cell binding. The crystal structure of a pilus adhesin from the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes reveals an internal thioester bond formed between the side chains of a cysteine and a glutamine residue. The presence of the thioester was verified using UV-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. This unusual bond has only previously been observed in thioester domains of complement and complement-like proteins where it is used to form covalent attachment to target molecules. The structure also reveals two intramolecular isopeptide bonds, one of these formed through a Lys/Asp residue pair, which are strategically positioned to confer protein stability. Removal of the internal thioester by allele-replacement mutagenesis in S. pyogenes severely compromises bacterial adhesion to model host cells. Although current paradigms of bacterial/host cell interaction envisage strong non-covalent interactions, the present study suggests cell adhesion could also involve covalent bonds.
TI  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. The activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. An overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of CDCs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. The way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. Their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. In this chapter I aim to provide an overview of our understanding of the interaction between CDCs and other members of what is now called the MACPF/CDC superfamily, with their target membranes. CDCs (also in the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four Gram-positive bacterial genera (Clostridium, Listeria, Bacillus and Streptococcus). Well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. Listeriolysin from L. monocytogenes is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. Perfringolysin from C. perfringens (Fig. 1A) has become perhaps the most studied CDC4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). Streptolysin from S. pyogenes is another intensely studied CDC and has been applied widely in experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. Pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for S. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. However, CDCs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone Metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. The homology with the MACPF family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic MACPF/CDC fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (Fig. 1A and D). Without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. The glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that CDCs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. While not all MACPF domains are involved in pore formation-for example, C6 and C8beta--they are all apparently involved in action on membranes. The dramatic refolding undergone by CDCs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the MACPF/CDC domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (Fig. 1A-C). It is obviously the basic assumption that where nonCDC members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 Even where a member of the MACPF/CDC superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. However, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another MACPF/CDC family member or members from the same specific system. Complement acts by a combination of the C5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting C9 to form a lesion, which may be a complete ring of C9 associated with the C5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.Perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). Incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of novel fluoroquinolone derivatives containing substituted piperidines.
AB  - We report herein the synthesis of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-aminomethyl-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives. The antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated and correlated with their physicochemical properties. Results reveal that all of the target compounds have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.125-4 microg/mL). Compounds 12, 13 are more potent than or comparable to levofloxacin against MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella sonnei. Compound 17 is more active than or comparable to levofloxacin against S. aureus including MRSA, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical profile of Community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as defined by British Thoracic society, from December 1998 to Dec 2000, at the Sher- i-Kashmir institute of Medical Sciences Soura, Srinagar, India. Gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). In 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7/29), Escherichia coli (6/29), Klebsiella spp. (3/29), Streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and Acinetobacter spp. (1/29). Sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). Maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). The commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), COPD (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). Fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, Pseudomonas in two, Klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. The factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of COPD or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. The overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. This emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for Legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of CAP.
TI  - The Viriato study: update on antimicrobial resistance of microbial pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Portugal.
AB  - The Viriato study is a prospective, multicentre laboratory-based surveillance study of antimicrobial susceptibility in which 30 microbiology laboratories throughout Portugal are asked to isolate, identify and submit to a central laboratory for testing Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis responsible for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections and Streptococcus pyogenes from tonsillitis. To monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns of these frequent respiratory pathogens. Susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) or using Etest strips following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. From 1999 to 2007 over 13 900 isolates were analysed. Among S. pneumoniae penicillin non-susceptibility decreased from 25% in 1999 to 18% in 2007 (p = 0.002) but resistance to macrolides showed a steady increase, reaching 20% in the last 6 years. Resistance to amoxicillin and the quinolones remained stable and very low (1-2%) throughout the study period. Antimicrobial resistance among H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis remained stable. The most significant resistance was to ampicillin, of 10-12% and greater than 80%, respectively, as a result of the production of beta-lactamases. Macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes was stable during 1999-2003 (20-23%) but after 2003 there was a steady decline in resistance, which in 2007 reached 10%. The Viriato surveillance study showed that penicillin remains the most active antimicrobial agent against S. pyogenes causing tonsillitis, and amoxicillin-clavulanate and the quinolones are the most active in vitro simultaneously against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis responsible for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Portugal.
TI  - Asymptomatic colonization of upper respiratory tract by potential bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen for asymptomatic respiratory carriage of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in children attending JIPMER, correlate carriage rate with different socio-demographic factors and to detect antimicrobial resistance among the isolates. METHODS: Throat swabs were collected from both in patients and out patients (<or=12 yr of age) and processed. Bacteria were identified by Standard techniques. Susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was determined by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Overall carriage rate of respiratory pathogens was 30% with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and GAS accounting for 22%, 5% and 4.5% respectively. Three patients had >1 organism. Antibiotic resistance was highest in S. pneumoniae with 66.7% of strains resistant to penicillin. MDR strains were also encountered. Erythromycin resistance was observed in both H. influenzae (28.4%) and GAS (22%). No statistically significant association was found between the carriage rate of these organisms and different socio-demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae carriage rate was comparatively higher in the Community and its antimicrobial resistance is an issue to address.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. Six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between January and September 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI). Ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest MIC(90 )against 965 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP)). Against 470 Haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. Higher MIC(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). As was foreseeable, Streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains) was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated MIC(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. Beta-lactamase-negative Moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. Levofloxacin showed the lowest MIC(50)/MIC(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. As regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest MIC(90)s against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest MIC(90)s against Escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).In conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for CARTI, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of CARTI.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Clinical outcomes in Mexican children with febrile acute upper respiratory tract  infections: no impact of antibiotic therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes (duration of signs and symptoms) and  the microbiology in Mexican children with non-complicated febrile upper respiratory tract infections (URI), with and without the use of antibiotics. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study from September 2006 to July 2007. The study population consisted of 880 children aged 6 months to 5 years 11 months, attending four community daycare centers run by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) and three non-IMSS daycare centers. Children with a febrile URI were enrolled before receiving any antimicrobials and were followed up for two weeks. Duration of the fever, cough, runny nose, stuffy nose, irritability, loss of appetite, tiredness, and diarrhea, and isolation of Haemophilus influenzae,Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were compared in those children who received antibiotic treatment and those who did not receive antibiotics. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 145 out of 880 children were enrolled, and among those enrolled, 85/145 (59%) children received antibiotics. There was no significant difference in the duration of the signs and symptoms evaluated in the two groups. Although the proportions of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes isolated in children with and without antibiotics were comparable, those in whom we isolated S. pneumoniae had both a significantly longer episode of URI, as well as longer lasting diarrhea. Similarly, children receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment experienced significantly longer durations of fever and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The mean duration of signs and symptoms and the microbiological isolates of children with febrile URI were comparable among children treated with or without antibiotics, with the exception of a longer duration of URI and diarrhea in those children with an S. pneumoniae isolate. Our findings suggest that in our population, most cases of febrile URI are caused by viral infections, and demonstrate that antibiotics should not be used routinely in children with non-complicated febrile URI.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The activity of ceftobiprole and comparator agents was evaluated against a collection of 880 isolates, comprising 200 meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 200 meticillin-resistant S. aureus, 180 coagulase-negative staphylococci blood isolates, 100 Streptococcuspneumoniae and 200 macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci (100 Streptococcus pyogenes and 100 Streptococcus agalactiae). Ceftobiprole showed excellent activity against staphylococci (minimum inhibitory concentrations <or=4 microg/mL), irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents such as oxacillin, linezolid or glycopeptides. Ceftobiprole was also highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci, inhibiting 99.6% of all streptococci tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. Based on these results, ceftobiprole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - A novel approach to the antimicrobial activity of maggot debridement therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Commercially produced sterile green bottle fly Lucilia sericata maggots are successfully employed by practitioners worldwide to clean a multitude of chronic necrotic wounds and reduce wound bacterial burdens during maggot debridement therapy (MDT). Secretions from the maggots exhibit antimicrobial activity along with other activities beneficial for wound healing. With the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria, new approaches to identifying the active compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity within this treatment are imperative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use a novel approach to investigate the output of secreted proteins from the maggots under conditions mimicking clinical treatments. METHODS: cDNA libraries constructed from microdissected salivary glands and whole maggots, respectively, were treated with transposon-assisted signal trapping (TAST), a technique selecting for the identification of secreted proteins. Several putative secreted components of insect immunity were identified, including a defensin named lucifensin, which was produced recombinantly as a Trx-fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, and tested in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. RESULTS: Lucifensin was active against Staphylococcus carnosus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC 2 mg/L), as well as Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 16 mg/L). The peptide did not show antimicrobial activity towards Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of lucifensin for the methicillin-resistant S. aureus and glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus isolates tested ranged from 8 to >128 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The TAST results did not reveal any highly secreted compounds with putative antimicrobial activity, implying an alternative antimicrobial activity of MDT. Lucifensin showed antimicrobial activities comparable to other defensins and could have potential as a future drug candidate scaffold, for redesign for other applications besides the topical treatment of infected wounds.
TI  - [Immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. Researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the Dr Ladislao de la Pascua Dermatology Clinic between September 2008 and February 2009. The patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. Patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. In all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured. RESULTS: A history of immunization (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-6.7; P=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.2; P=.033), and being a carrier of Streptococcus pyogenes (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.5; P=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as risk factors for development of the disease. Given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.
TI  - Identifying gene clusters within localized regions in multiple genomes.
AB  - An important strategy to study genome evolution is to investigate the clustering  of orthologous genes among multiple genomes, in which the most popular approaches require that the distance between adjacent genes in a cluster be small. We investigate a different formulation based on constraining the overall size of a cluster and develop statistical significance estimates that allow direct comparison of clusters of different sizes. We first consider a restricted version which requires that orthologous genes are strictly ordered within each cluster and show that it can be solved in polynomial time. We then develop practical exact algorithms for the unrestricted problem that allows paralogous genes within a genome and clusters that may not appear in every genome while considering a general model in which a gene is allowed to appear in more than one orthologous group. We show that our algorithm can identify biologically relevant gene clusters on four bacterial genomes Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium acetobutylicum. We also show that our algorithm can identify significantly more functionally enriched gene clusters on four yeast genomes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus than previous algorithms. A software program (GCFinder) and a list of gene clusters found on the bacterial and the yeast genomes are available at http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/shsze/gcfinder .
TI  - Activity of a novel series of acylides active against community-acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Resistance to macrolides and beta-lactams has increased sharply amongst key respiratory pathogens, leading to major concern. A novel series of acylides was designed to overcome this resistance and was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo activity. This series of acylides was designed starting from clarithromycin by changing the substitution on the desosamine nitrogen, followed by conversion to 3-O-acyl and 11,12-carbamate. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of acylides were determined against susceptible as well as macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B))--and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis by the agar dilution method. Microbroth MICs for Haemophilus influenzae were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. In vivo efficacy was determined by target organ load reduction against S. pneumoniae 3579 (ermB). The bactericidal potential of promising acylides was also determined. MICs of these compounds against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were in the range of 0.06-2, 0.125-1, 1-16 and 0.015-0.5 microg/mL, respectively, irrespective of their resistance pattern. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila showed MIC ranges of 0.004-0.125 microg/mL and 0.004-0.03 microg/mL, respectively. The acylides also showed better activity against telithromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Compounds with a 4-furan-2-yl-1H-imidazolyl side chain on the carbamate (RBx 10000296) showed a target organ load reduction of >3 log(10) colony-forming units/mL and concentration-dependent bactericidal potential against S. pneumoniae 994 mefA and H. influenzae strains. This novel and potent series of acylides active against antibiotic-resistant respiratory pathogens should be further investigated.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the tet (M)-carrying conjugative transposon Tn5251 of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The Tn916-like genetic element Tn5251 is part of the composite conjugative transposon (CTn) Tn5253 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a 64.5-kb chromosomal element originally called Omega(cat-tet) BM6001. DNA sequence analysis showed that Tn5251 is 18 033-bp long and contains 22 ORFs, 20 of which have the same direction of transcription. Annotation was possible for 11 out of 22 ORFs, including the tet(M) tetracycline resistance gene and int and xis involved in the integration/excision process. Autonomous copies of Tn5251 were generated during matings of Tn5253-containing donors with S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Tn5251 was shown to integrate at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. It behaves as a fully functional CTn capable of independent conjugal transfer to a variety of bacterial species including S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. The excision of Tn5251 produces a circular intermediate and a deletion in Tn5253 at a level of 1.2 copies per 10(5) chromosomes.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of S-013420, a novel bicyclolide, against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of S-013420, a novel bicyclolide, was investigated. METHODS: All test strains for this study were isolated from Japanese medical facilities. MICs were determined by the microbroth dilution method or agar dilution method according to the CLSI guidelines. In time-kill kinetics, viable cells were measured at 1, 2.5, 4 and 6 h after exposure to antimicrobials. The frequencies of single-step resistance acquisition at 4x MIC and 8x MIC were determined using 10(7) cfu of bacterial cells. RESULTS: S-013420 showed MIC(90) values of 0.125, 0.125, 8 and 0.5 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively. S-013420 showed the most potent activity against erythromycin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC(90) of 0.25 mg/L and inhibited the growth of all strains of S. pyogenes with macrolide resistance genes at 1 mg/L. The MICs of S-013420 for atypical pathogens such as erythromycin-susceptible Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were 0.00049-0.001 and 0.0039 mg/L, respectively, although the activity of S-013420, as well as other macrolide agents, against erythromycin-resistant M. pneumoniae was significantly weak. S-013420 caused a 3 log(10) reduction in viable cells against all test strains of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Acquisition of resistance to S-013420 was not observed for three strains of S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: S-013420 shows potent in vitro activity against respiratory tract pathogens. Against streptococci, including erythromycin-resistant strains, S-013420 demonstrated the most potent in vitro activity among the antimicrobials tested.
TI  - Predicting bacteremic pneumonia in HIV-1-infected patients consulting the ED.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: HIV-1-infected patients have higher incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and risk of complications. Bacteremia has been associated with a higher risk of complications in such patients. We investigated factors associated with bacteremia in HIV-1-infected patients with CAP presenting at the emergency department. METHODS: We included HIV-1-infected patients with CAP for 3 years (March 2005-February 2008). Only patients in whom blood cultures were performed were finally included. Clinical data (age; sex; CD4(+) count; serum HIV viral load; previous or current intravenous drug use and antiretroviral treatment; systolic blood pressure; and cardiac and respiratory rates), analytical data (leukocyte count, arterial oxygen content, C-reactive protein value, and urgent Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella spp antigen urine detection), and APACHE-II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) score were compiled. The need for intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, mortality, and for patients finally discharged, duration of admission were retrospectively obtained from the clinical history. A multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to find independent predictors of bacteremia. RESULTS: We diagnosed 129 HIV-1-infected patients with CAP. Blood cultures were performed in 118 cases (91%). Bacteremia was present in 28 (24%). Independent predictors of bacteremia were the detection of S pneumoniae antigen in urine (odds ratio, 9.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-42.0) and the absence of current antiretroviral treatment (odds ratio, 7.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-33.3). In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with bacteremia (15% vs 0%). CONCLUSION: HIV-1-infected patients with CAP who are not on current antiretroviral therapy and have positive S pneumoniae antigenuria are at increased risk of having bacteremia. Bacteremic patients have a poor outcome.
TI  - [Recombinant fragments of conservative proteins of group B streptococci as a basis of specific vaccine].
AB  - AIM: The study devoted to problem of using of recombinant fragments of group B streptococci (GBS) conservative proteins for induction of immune response against streptococcal infections. Two recombinant polypeptides (ScaAB and-ScpB1) corresponding to immunogenic epitopes of two surface GBS proteins ScaAB and C5a-peptidase, which are presented in other streptococcal species, were studied. The objective of the study was to assess specificity and protective activity of mentioned polypeptides against homologous and heterologous strains of pathogenic streptococci from different groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae were used in the study. Array of used methods included opsonophagocytic test as well as active and passive protection of experimental animals against streptococcal infection. RESULTS: It was shown that antibodies specific to studied polypeptides opsonized several strains of group A and B streptococci as well as pneumococci. Immunization of mice with ScpB1 polypeptide resulted in more rapid recovery of animals from challenge systemic group B streptococcal infection. Antisera specific to both polypeptides provided passive protection of animals from infection caused either GBS or GAS. CONCLUSION: Obtained data confirm the feasibility to use recombinant fragments of several GBS conservative proteins in vaccine for induction of protection against infections caused by different species of pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among respiratory pathogens in Spain: latest data and changes over 11 years (1996-1997 to 2006-2007).
AB  - A nationwide multicenter susceptibility surveillance study (Susceptibility to the Antimicrobials Used in the Community in Espana [SAUCE] project), SAUCE-4, including 2,559 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2,287 Streptococcus pyogenes, and 2,736 Haemophilus influenzae isolates was carried out from May 2006 to June 2007 in 34 Spanish hospitals. Then, the results from SAUCE-4 were compared to those from all three previous SAUCE studies carried out in 1996-1997, 1998-1999, and 2001-2002 to assess the temporal trends in resistance and the phenotypes of resistance over the 11-year period. In SAUCE-4, on the basis of the CLSI breakpoints, penicillin (parenteral, nonmeningitis breakpoint) and cefotaxime were the antimicrobials that were the most active against S. pneumoniae (99.8% and 99.6%, respectively). Only 0.9% of isolates had a penicillin MIC of > or = 2 microg/ml. In S. pyogenes, nonsusceptibility to erythromycin was observed in 19.4% of isolates. Among the H. influenzae isolates, a beta-lactamase-positive prevalence of 15.7% was found. A statistically significant temporal decreasing trend over the 11-year period was observed for nonsusceptibility (from 60.0% to 22.9%) and resistance (from 36.5% to 0.9%) to penicillin and for the proportion of erythromycin-resistant isolates of S. pneumoniae of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) phenotype (from 98.4% to 81.3%). A similar trend was observed for the prevalence of ampicillin resistance (from 37.6% to 16.1%), beta-lactamase production (from 25.7% to 15.7%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistance (BLNAR) in H. influenzae (from 13.5% to 0.7%). Among erythromycin-resistant isolates of S. pyogenes, a significant increasing trend in the prevalence of MLS(B) was observed (from 7.0% to 35.5%). SAUCE-4 confirms a generalized decline in the resistance of the main respiratory pathogens to the antimicrobials as well as a shift in their resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Are there any differences in the community acquired pneumonias admitted to hospital over the past decade?
AB  - The past few years have seen a decline in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children in the western world, although this has gone hand-in-hand with more serious cases needing hospital admission. Our study characterises cases of CAP admitted to hospital and compares this data with a 2001 study. We collected data on 63 admissions over a six-month period. The majority were aged 0-2 years old. Chest X-ray showed consolidation/atelectasy in 58 (92.1%) and pleural effusion (PE) in 17 (27.0%), of which 11 were empyema (17.4% of all admissions). The bacterial agent was isolated in five cases: Streptococcus pyogenes (two, pleural fluid), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two, blood culture) and Haemophilus influenzae (one, blood culture). Sixty-one children (96.8%) were prescribed antibiotherapy. The median length of hospital stay was five days. Patients with PE were older, had a longer course of fever, higher inflammatory parameters, longer hospital stay and longer course of iv antibiotics. Compared to the prior study we found greater severity of CAP, with higher prevalence of PE and empyema. Nevertheless there was a shorter course of fever during hospital stay and shorter hospital stay. We also noticed less antibiotic prescription prior to admission and greater prescription of ampicillin during hospital stay. In the literature, the higher severity of CAP has been partially attributed to the emergence of more aggressive serotypes of Stretococcus pneumoniae not included in the heptavalent vaccine. There is therefore a greater interest in new vaccines containing them. Complicated CAP should be referred to centres specialising in its diagnosis and management.
TI  - Association of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection and increased hospitalization with parapneumonic empyema in children in Utah.
AB  - BACKGROUND: During previous influenza pandemics, many deaths were associated with secondary bacterial infection. In April 2009, a previously unknown 2009 influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) emerged, causing a global influenza pandemic. We examined the relationship between circulating 2009 H1N1 and the occurrence of secondary bacterial parapneumonic empyema in children. METHODS: Children hospitalized with parapneumonic empyema from August 2004 to July 2009, including a period when the 2009 H1N1 circulated in Utah, were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. We compared the average number of children diagnosed with influenza A and the number of admissions for empyema per month for the previous 4 seasons to rates of empyema during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. We identified causative bacteria using culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: We observed an increase in hospitalization of children with pneumonia complicated by empyema during a severe outbreak of 2009 H1N1 during the spring and summer of 2009, compared with historical data for the previous 4 seasons. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were the predominant bacteria identified. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous pandemics, secondary bacterial infection with S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were associated with the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. There is an urgent need to better understand bacterial complications of pandemic influenza. In the interim, influenza vaccines, antiviral agents, and pneumococcal vaccines should be used to prevent cases of secondary bacterial pneumonia whenever possible.
TI  - [Interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to the expression of the mecA gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. For macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins B, (MLS(B)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vanA isolates). In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to MLS(B) in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parC/parE (low level) and in gyrA. It is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in Spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vanA enterococci and case reports due to vanB2 enterococci have been recently reported.
TI  - Collagen VI is a subepithelial adhesive target for human respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial engagement of specific host tissue structures can be a means of targeting a pathogen to a particular niche, establishing persistent infections and inducing invasion. In this context, primary adhesion is often the first crucial colonization step allowing pathogens to withstand the mechanical clearing mechanisms of the host. As a consequence, bacteria have evolved adhesins with the capacity to mediate interaction between microorganism and host. Here we describe collagen VI as a novel target for adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In upper and lower airways this collagen was distributed in the lamina propria underneath the epithelial basement membrane. Both pathogens exhibited strong affinity to collagen VI as shown by light and electron microscopy in combination with immunodetection and in vitro binding assays. For S. pyogenes this interaction was mediated by M1 protein. The presented data provide evidence for a previously unrecognized role for collagen VI in host-pathogen interplay during respiratory tract infection.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of new 9-O-arylpropenyloxime ketolides.
AB  - A novel series of 9-O-arylpropenyloxime ketolide was synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity. This series of ketolide exhibited potent activity against clinically isolated gram-positive strains including Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Straptococcus Pyogenes.
TI  - Synthesis of 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine derivatives as  antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized to determine their antibacterial and antifungal activities as well as possible structure-activity relationships (SARs) to improve therapeutic efficacy. The pyrazol-5-amine benzamides were screened for their antibacterial activity against standard strains of Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes NCIM 2608, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29737, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2010) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 20852, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 618) bacteria by using streptomycin as positive control. They were also tested for their antifungal activities against mycotoxic strains of Fusarium verticillioides, Aspergillus ochraceous, Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata, and Penicillium chrysogenum using nystatin as positive control. Among the synthesized compounds, 9d, 9g, and 9h showed potent antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive non-urinary isolates to fosfomycin.
AB  - We aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against Gram-positive non-urinary isolates collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, in 2008. Susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method for a total of 1846 isolates; 1275 isolates (69.1%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Specifically, 416/419 Staphylococcus aureus (99.3%) [including 129/130 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates] and 745/961 coagulase-negative staphylococci (77.5%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Among 42 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 64 Streptococcus pyogenes and 93 other streptococcal isolates, 61.9%, 40.6% and 48.4%, respectively, were susceptible to fosfomycin. Fosfomycin was inactive against the 166 enterococcal isolates tested. This old antibiotic may deserve consideration for further studies and use in clinical practice, especially for S. aureus (including MRSA) infections.
TI  - Broad spectrum respiratory pathogen analysis of throat swabs from military recruits reveals interference between rhinoviruses and adenoviruses.
AB  - Military recruits experience a high incidence of febrile respiratory illness (FRI), leading to significant morbidity and lost training time. Adenoviruses, group A Streptococcus pyogenes, and influenza virus are implicated in over half of the FRI cases reported at recruit training center clinics, while the etiology of the remaining cases is unclear. In this study, we explore the carriage rates and disease associations of adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis in military recruits using high-density resequencing microarrays. The results showed that rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis were widely distributed in recruits. Of these five agents, only adenovirus showed significant correlation with illness. Among the samples tested, only pathogens associated with FRI, such as adenovirus 4 and enterovirus 68, revealed strong temporal and spatial clustering of specific strains, indicating that they are transmitted primarily within sites. The results showed a strong negative association between adenoviral FRI and the presence of rhinoviruses in recruits, suggesting some form of viral interference.
TI  - [Emergence pathogens infections in ENT Department of Children's hospital in 2005-2008].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of medicine, in this the new techniques and antibiotic therapy enlarged the survivability of patients in hospital. Applying antibiotics caused breakthrough in treatment stepping out in ill's group infections treated in hospital, however enlarging resistance is natural this effect, resulting from: the selection of resistant strains, the formation of new mechanisms of resistance, and/or the spreading of gene of resistance. Multidrug-resistant strains were included to emergence-pathogens group: MRSA, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, VRE, Gram-negative producing beta-lactamase of type the ESBL and/or resistant to carbapenems. Emergence-pathogens occurrence leads to: therapeutic failures, the use extorts in therapy of dear medicines or with possibility of workings undesirable. The multidrug-resistant strains spread in hospital environment easily, especially on departments about high waste of medicines with the patients' simultaneously large susceptibility on infection, resulting mainly with state of reduced resistance of organism. The control of hospital infections recognize by present hospitality for the most important criterion of quality of work. AIM: Analysis of the emergence-pathogens isolated during treatment in hospital in 2005-2008, from special regard the ENT Department. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50586 children treated in this period in hospital in which was executed 39386 bacteriological investigations, in this 6528 (12.9%) children in ENT Department in which was executed 1566 bacteriological investigations (3.98%). The diagnostics were executed according to routine microbiological procedures with qualification of resistance to antibiotics. RESULTS: Emergence-pathogens infection was confirmed at 2369 children's (4.68%) treated in Hospital, in this in ENT Department at 84 children (1.29%). The most frequent emergence-pathogens in ENT Department were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-resistant and average sensitive on penicillin, Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-resistant and average sensitive to penicillin and Rotavirus infections are the most frequent hospital infections. The systematic microbiological supervision is indispensable in prevention the spreading of infections of the emergence-pathogens in hospital.
TI  - CEM-101 activity against Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CEM-101, a new fluoroketolide, was determined against Gram-positive organisms with various macrolide susceptibility profiles. Experiments for determination of the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), timed killing, single-step and multistep mutation rates, the erythromycin induction of resistance, postantibiotic effect (PAE), and drug interactions were performed for CEM-101; and the results were compared to those obtained with telithromycin, macrolides, and lincosamides. The MBCs of CEM-101 remained lower overall than those of telithromycin, and CEM-101 displayed a 2-fold greater potency than the ketolide. Timed-killing curve testing showed that CEM-101 had greater bactericidal activity than telithromycin (a >or=3-log(10)-CFU/ml decrease in the initial inoculum at 24 h) against the staphylococcal isolates tested. The propensity of CEM-101 to cause resistance was low, as determined from the rates of resistance determined in single-step mutational studies (<10(-8) or 10(-9)). In multipassaging studies, mutants of two strains (both of which were USA300 isolates) resistant to CEM-101 emerged. That number was comparable to the number resistant to clindamycin but less than the number resistant to telithromycin. Erythromycin induced CEM-101 resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, similar to telithromycin; however, in seven of eight beta-hemolytic streptococci, CEM-101 resistance induction was not observed. CEM-101 showed a significant concentration- and exposure-dependent PAE against the strains tested, with the values ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 h for Gram-positive organisms (these times were longer than those for telithromycin). No antagonism was found in synergy analyses, with enhanced inhibition being most noted for combinations with CEM-101 and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Overall, this new antimicrobial agent (CEM-101) showed good antimicrobial characteristics compared with those of the agents in its class and exhibited measured parameter values similar or superior to those of utilized comparators, indicating that CEM-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.
TI  - [Resistance study of community respiratory pathogens isolated in China from 2005  to 2007].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of community respiratory pathogens isolated in China. METHODS: The strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, S. pyogenes were isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections at 14 Chinese hospitals from 2005 to 2007. Etest and disk diffusion methods were used to survey the susceptibility of 14 antibiotics against these strains. These antibiotics included penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefprozil, ceftriaxone, cefepime, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT). RESULTS: A total of 1870 strains were collected including S. pneumoniae (n = 997), S. pyogenes (n = 176), H. influenzae (n = 499) and M. catarrhalis (n = 198). The 2005 - 2007 prevalence of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) were 92.6%, 73.9%, 74.1% and penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) 4.5%, 9.5%, 14.3% and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 2.9%, 16.6%, 11.6% respectively. 36.9% of S. pneumoniae strains isolated from <or= 6 years old children were penicillin-non-susceptive isolates (PNSSP) and < 22.0% of PNSSP isolated from other age groups. The susceptible rates of beta-lactamase antibiotics to PRSP and PISP isolates were less than 25.0% and 49.2% respectively. From 48.5% to 98.6% PSSP isolates were susceptible to beta-lactamase antibiotics. The susceptible rates of PNSSP and PSSP to erythromycin, tetracycline and SXT were below 7.1% and 32.1% respectively. About 95% S. pneumoniae were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin. All of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to beta-lactamase antibiotics, and 16.7%, 27.1% and 15.6% Of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to erythromycin. 8.5%, 19.9%, 15.3% of H. influenzae and 57.4%, 78.8%, 95.5% of M. catarrhalis produced beta-lactamase during the 3-year period. The susceptible rates of cefepime, ceftriaxone, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were >or= 92.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae is rising. The prevalence of PNSSP isolated from children < or = 6 years old is higher than other age groups. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin remain highly active against common community respiratory pathogens.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - Autoimmune diseases: Solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  - Autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. These are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. Here we describe these components and how they interact. Known microbial triggers are Streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, Proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and Klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. The immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is caused by loss of suppressor T cells. This leaves Burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in Graves' disease, as the immunological defect. With wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. This dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (H Gene Theory). We show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. Because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically. Isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. Kaplans's discovery that xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.
TI  - Development of a novel DNA microarray to detect bacterial pathogens in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
AB  - A novel microarray was constructed with DNA PCR product probes targeting species  specific functional genes of nine clinically significant respiratory pathogens, including the Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes), the Gram-negative organisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii Haemophilus spp., Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as the atypical bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In a "proof-of-concept" evaluation of the developed microarray, the microarray was compared with real-time PCR from 14 sputum specimens from COPD patients. All of the samples positive for bacterial species in real-time PCR were also positive for the same bacterial species using the microarray. This study shows that a microarray using PCR probes is a potentially useful method to monitor the populations of bacteria in respiratory specimens and can be tailored to specific clinical needs such as respiratory infections of particular patient populations, including patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of respiratory pathogens in North African countries.
AB  - This study reports the antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from patients in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. 672 non-duplicate isolates were recovered from May 2006 to May 2007. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the E-test and interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Among 236 S. pneumoniae, 47% were penicillin non-susceptible (PNSP) with 3% of strains being highly resistant; 20.4% and 17.4% had decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin and cefotaxime, respectively. Dual resistance to penicillin and erythromycin was observed in 30.1%. All isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin except one. Among 262 H. influenzae, 13.3% were amoxicillin-resistant and beta-lactamase producers. Two isolates were beta-lactamase-positive and amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant. All isolates were susceptible to cefixime, cefotaxime and levofloxacin. All S. pyogenes (174) were susceptible to beta-lactams with 5.7% resistant to erythromycin. Five had decreased susceptibility to levofloxacin. These data on respiratory tract pathogens indicate the high prevalence of PNSP in North African countries.
TI  - [Bacteriophage lysins: progress and perspective--a review].
AB  - Phage endolysin targets the integrate cell wall and attack bonds in the peptidoglycan, resulting in degradation of bacteria. It features two or three domain structures, involving one or two catalytic domains and one binding domain. Endolysin is a promising antibiotic agent against gram-positive bacteria pathogen, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Compared to antibiotics, it is more specific and tested bacteria show no resistance to lysin. Therefore, it's a feasible measure for solving drug resistant problem. Beyond this, it is highly active and rapid lysis efficiency and has synergy effect when used together or with other antibiotics. Antibody against endolysin will not neutralize its activity. So endolysin treatment may be a new approach for preventing and controlling of bacteria pathogen.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-ylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidene-4,6-pyrimidinediones.
AB  - 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidenepyrimidine-4,6-diones (compounds 1-9), carrying 2,3,4-trifluoro or 3,4,5-trimethoxy groups on the benzylidene moiety, and rhodanine derivatives 10 and 11 were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against four standard bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Compounds 1-3 and 9 that were active against S. aureus, were also tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615. (Z)-5-(2,3,4-Trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 0.5 microg/mL and MRSA at 32 microg/mL. Stronger antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. Neither of the compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. Cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. The patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. Sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. The tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only HIV infection were 10 (5.9%). The distribution of isolates were as follows, Staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), Candida albicans 24 (14.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), Proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and Escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). Those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. This study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to HIV/AIDS and TB or co-infection with TB/HIV-AIDS. This may lead to drug resistance, DOTS or HAART programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 3-O-carbamoyl derivatives of clarithromycin and 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin.
AB  - Two series of novel 3-O-carbamoyl derivatives of clarithromycin and 11,12-cyclic  carbonate azithromycin were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. Compounds 4j and 4k were the most potent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which were comparable to those of clarithromycin and azithromycin. Compounds 4d, 4h and 4i showed potent activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene and compounds 4h and 4i displayed greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene. Compound 7c exhibited improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm and mef genes.
TI  - Detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  - An algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. The approach was based on a two-step procedure. The first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. The second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below which a specific investigation is required. The algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in Lyon, France. The first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. The modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. Setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (Acinetobacter baumannii) to 294 days (Enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for A. baumannii) except for E. cloacae (52.1%). Setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for A. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis and 25% for Enterobacter cloacae. The threshold values then ranged from 8 days (S. pneumoniae) to 67 days (Streptococcus pyogenes). The approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin 4''-O-carbamate derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin 4''-O-carbamate derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. Compounds 7b and 7d were the most effective (0.5 and 0.5 microg ml(-1)) against two strains of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae whose resistance was encoded by the erm gene and the erm and mef genes, respectively. Compounds 7a, 7e and 7g showed significantly potent activity against erythromycin-susceptible strains such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. pyogenes. These results suggest that the introduction of the prolonged arylalkylcarbamoyl group to the C-4'' position can dramatically enhance the activity against erythromycin-resistant bacteria encoded by the erm gene or the erm and mef genes.
TI  - Widening differences in acute otitis media study populations.
AB  
TI  - Acute otitis media caused by Moraxella catarrhalis: epidemiologic and clinical characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study describes the epidemiologic, microbiologic, and otologic features and selected signs and symptoms of acute otitis media (AOM) caused by Moraxella catarrhalis and compares them with AOM caused by other bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Patients aged <5 years with culture-positive AOM from whom a middle ear fluid specimen was obtained and cultured during 1999-2006 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Of a total of 12,799 AOM episodes, 8198 (64%) were culture positive, with isolation of 10,382 pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, 4982 (48.0%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4450 (42.9%); M. catarrhalis, 501 (4.8%); and group A streptococci, 449 (4.3%). The distribution of single versus mixed M. catarrhalis infection was significantly different compared with the 3 other pathogens (165 cases [32.9%] as a single pathogen of all M. catarrhalis AOM episodes vs 3108 [62.4%] in AOM caused by H. influenzae, 2592 [58.2%] in AOM caused by S. pneumoniae, and 304 [67.7%] in AOM caused by group A streptococci; P < .001 for all comparisons). In multivariate analysis, M. catarrhalis AOM was more frequent in patients experiencing their first AOM episode versus recurrent AOM and mixed infections. M. catarrhalis AOM was associated with lower proportions of spontaneous perforation of tympanic membrane compared with all other pathogens. None of the AOM episodes caused by M. catarrhalis was associated with mastoiditis. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with AOM caused by other pathogens, AOM caused by M. catarrhalis is characterized by a higher proportion of mixed infections, younger age at diagnosis, a lower proportion of spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane, and no mastoiditis.
TI  - In vitro activity of CEM-101 against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes with defined macrolide resistance mechanisms.
AB  - CEM-101 had MIC ranges of 0.002 to 0.016 microg/ml against macrolide-susceptible  pneumococci and 0.004 to 1 microg/ml against macrolide-resistant phenotypes. Only 3 strains with erm(B), with or without mef(A), had CEM-101 MICs of 1 microg/ml, and 218/221 strains had CEM-101 MICs of <or=0.5 microg/ml. CEM-101 MICs were as much as 4-fold lower than telithromycin MICs against all strains. For Streptococcus pyogenes, CEM-101 MICs ranged from 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml against macrolide-susceptible strains and from 0.015 to 1 microg/ml against macrolide-resistant strains. Against erm(B) strains, erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin MICs were 32 to >64 microg/ml, while 17/19 strains had telithromycin MICs of 4 to 16 microg/ml; CEM-101 MICs were 0.015 to 1 microg/ml. By comparison, erm(A) and mef(A) strains had CEM-101 MICs of 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml, clindamycin and telithromycin MICs of <or=1 microg/ml, and erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin MICs of 0.5 to >64 microg/ml. Pneumococcal multistep resistance studies showed that although CEM-101 yielded clones with higher MICs for all eight strains tested, seven of eight strains had clones with CEM-101 MICs that rose from 0.004 to 0.03 microg/ml (parental strains) to 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml (resistant clones); for only one erm(B) mef(A) strain with a parental MIC of 1 microg/ml was there a resistant clone with a MIC of 32 microg/ml, with no detectable mutations in the L4, L22, or 23S rRNA sequence. Among two of five S. pyogenes strains tested, CEM-101 MICs rose from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml, and only for the one strain with erm(B) did CEM-101 MICs rise from 1 to 8 microg/ml, with no changes occurring in any macrolide resistance determinant. CEM-101 had low MICs as well as low potential for the selection of resistant mutants, independent of bacterial species or resistance phenotypes in pneumococci and S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of quinolones against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin (LVFX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), norfloxacin (NFLX), prulifloxacin (PUFX), and tosufloxacin (TFLX) using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from clinical materials. Based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area under the curve (AUC)/MIC of 120 or more for Gram-negative and 30 or more for Gram-positive bacteria was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and was assessed as the efficacy. GRNX showed the lowest MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against S. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. GRNX also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, MSSA) other than S. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of CPFX against H. influenzae was most potent. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of the other agents were also favorable. PUFX showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Both of MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. On efficacy assessment using MCS, GRNX, GFLX, and MFLX showed a probability of 90% or more against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Against S. agalactiae, GRNX, MFLX, and GFLX showed a probability of approximately 60%. All agents showed a low probability against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; PUFX showed a maximum (43.63%). GRNX, MFLX, GFLX, and LVFX showed a probability of 90% or more against MSSA. Furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance inhibition, an AUC/MIC of more than 200 against S. pneumoniae, is achieved. GRNX showed the highest probability (95.05%). It also exhibited a similar probability even when the target value was established as 250. Recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. In the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of select respiratory tract pathogens in Dakar, Senegal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative agents of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). The increase in resistance to current antibacterial agents highlights the need to monitor the resistance pattern of these bacterial pathogens. METHODOLOGY: In this study, we assessed the antibacterial susceptibility of these pathogens causing respiratory tract infections in Dakar, Senegal, during 2007-2008. A total of 290 bacterial isolates (75 H. influenzae, 10 M. catarrhalis, 105 S. pneumoniae, and 100 S. pyogenes) were collected. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: All H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, cephalosporins, and macrolides. Overall, 26.7% of H. influenzae isolates were completely resistant to ampicillin. Among the M. catarrhalis isolates, 30% were resistant to ampicillin. All the isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis that were resistant to ampicillin were beta-lactamase producing strains. Among the S. pneumoniae isolates, 33.3% isolates exhibited intermediate susceptibility to penicillin G, and one isolate was completely resistant. All five isolates that were resistant to erythromycin expressed the M phenotype. S. pyogenes exhibited high susceptibility to all other antibiotics, except tetracycline. Our study suggests that except for M. catarrhalis, all other bacterial isolates are susceptible to cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluroquinolones.
TI  - Necrotising fasciitis of the extremity.
AB  - Necrotising fasciitis is a rare, life-threatening infection where there is necrosis of fascia, subcutaneous tissues and skin. Three adult patients presented with this condition affecting the extremities and all had predisposing medical factors. Each one complained of severe pain that seemed disproportionate to the skin affected. They underwent prompt surgical debridement and received antibiotic treatment and supportive therapy. These cases highlight the increasing incidence and differences in presentation of necrotising fasciitis, as well as the important symptom of pain. Patients can become moribund and require intensive care support. High mortality rates are well recognised.
TI  - Bacterial coinfections in lung tissue specimens from fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) - United States, May-August 2009.
AB  - In previous influenza pandemics, studies of autopsy specimens have shown that most deaths attributed to influenza A virus infection occurred concurrently with bacterial pneumonia, but such evidence has been lacking for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). To help determine the role of bacterial coinfection in the current influenza pandemic, CDC examined postmortem lung specimens from patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) for bacterial causes of pneumonia. During May 1-August 20, 2009, medical examiners and local and state health departments submitted specimens to CDC from 77 U.S. patients with fatal cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). This report summarizes the demographic and clinical findings from these cases and the laboratory evaluation of the specimens. Evidence of concurrent bacterial infection was found in specimens from 22 (29%) of the 77 patients, including 10 caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Duration of illness was available for 17 of the 22 patients; median duration was 6 days (range: 1-25 days). Fourteen of 18 patients for whom information was available sought medical care while ill, and eight (44%) were hospitalized. These findings confirm that bacterial lung infections are occurring among patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and underscore both the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and the need for early recognition of bacterial pneumonia in persons with influenza.
TI  - Bacterial surface protein L binds and inactivates neutrophil proteins S100A8/A9.
AB  - Finegoldia magna is an anaerobic bacterial species that is part of the normal human flora on all nonsterile body surfaces, but it is also a significant opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of infections. Some isolates of F. magna that are more frequently associated with clinical infection express protein L, a surface protein containing multiple homologous domains (B1-B5) that bind Igs through interactions with Ig L chains. The present study shows that the N-terminal A domain of protein L binds S100A8/A9, antibacterial proteins present in large amounts in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, but also extracellularly in tissues during inflammation. As a result, protein L-expressing F. magna are protected against killing by S100A8/A9. Igs and S100A8/A9 were found to interact independently with protein L, demonstrating that this bacterial surface protein is capable of manipulating both adaptive and innate immune defense mechanisms.
TI  - Identification and characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase in Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases. Although many virulent factors have been identified and studied, relatively little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2. The aim of the study was to identify and understand the characterization of Inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). A 957-bp gene, impdh, was identified in the virulent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2), and analysis of the predicted IMPDH sequence revealed IMP dehydrogenase/GMP reductase domain. The gene encoding for the IMPDH of S. suis was cloned and sequenced. The DNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 318 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 23% sequence identity with the IMPDH from Streptococcus pyogenes (YP281355) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ZP00404150). Using the pET(32) expression plasmid, the impdh gene was inducibly overexpressed in Escherichia coli to produce IMPDH with a hexahistidyl N-terminus to permit its purification. The (His)6 IMPDH protein was found to possess functional IMPDH enzymatic activity after the purification. The impdh-knockout SS2 mutant ( Delta IMPDH) constructed in this study was slower in growth and one pH unit higher than SS2-H after 6 h of culturing, and found to be attenuated in mouse models of infection for 2.5 times and not be capable of causing death in porcine models of infection in contrast with the parent SS2-H.
TI  - Investigation of antibacterial activities of Albizia gummifera and Ferula communis on Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptoccus pyogenes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory Tract infections continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality world wide. There is a failure to treat respiratory infections due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains among the most common respiratory pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activities of two traditionally used plants: Albizia gummifera (Ambabesa-Muka, Oromifa, Sessa-Amharic.) and Ferula communis (Doge-Oromifa, Dog-Amharic) against clinical isolates of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae. METHODS: The study involving the antibacterial susceptibility test of traditionally used plant species against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens was conducted over a period of 5 months (January - August, 2004) at the Ethiopian Health, and Nutrition Research Institute. The in vitro antibacterial activities of 80% methanol crude extracts prepared from the seeds of Ablizia gummifera and, roots of Ferula communis as well as their respective hydro alcoholic solvent fractionates of both plant species were tested for inhibitory activity against the clinical isolates of six S. pneumonae and twenty two S. pyogenes using agar dilution method. RESULTS: Eighty percent ethanol solubilized fractions of both plants were found to have antibacterial effects to all assayed bacteria while aqueous solubilized fractions did not exhibit any effect. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 80% ethanol solubilized fractions was determined and the MIC of the fractions ranged from 500 mg/ ml to 1000 mg/ml for both plants showing the extracts may contain bioactive compounds of therapeutic interest. CONCLUSION: All extracts showed antibacterial activities against clinical isolates of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae. The extracts may contain compounds with potential therapeutic activity. Further purification and identification are needed to be tested using animal models.
TI  - Swine flu and antibiotics.
AB  - Health services worldwide are likely to be hard-pressed by swine flu-related illness in the months ahead. Secondary infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes), Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus are likely to be important causes of morbidity and mortality. The UK Department of Health recently published clinical pathways for the management of swine flu. Suggested severity criteria have not been validated in respiratory infection and are different from those previously published. Antibiotics are recommended for all patients assessed at hospital, regardless of severity of illness; cephalosporins or quinolones are suggested for inpatients with pneumonia. These recommendations will jeopardize recent decreases in Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in UK hospitals. This article, written on behalf of the BSAC Council, considers these recommendations and provides alternative antibiotic regimens for a range of clinical scenarios.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - Microbiology of the middle ear fluid in Costa Rican children between 2002 and 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because the microbiology and susceptibility patterns of middle ear fluid pathogens in children with otitis media change over time, an active surveillance is recommended to establish appropriate therapeutic guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens obtained from Costa Rican children with acute otitis media (AOM), recurrent otitis media (ROM) and therapeutic failure otitis media (OMTF) between 2002 and 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1108 children aged 2-92 months who participated in various otitis media clinical trials between the years 2002 and 2007. RESULTS: Among the study population, 880 were children with AOM (61% <24 months of age), 138 were children with ROM (54% <24 months of age) and 90 were children with OMTF (67% <24 months of age). Bilateral otitis media was more frequent in children with OMTF (44%) than in children with AOM (37%) (P=0.19) and ROM (27%) (P=0.009). Presence of siblings <8 years of age was more frequently observed in children with OMTF (73%) than in children with ROM (65%) (P=0.0001) and AOM (47%) (P=0.000002). Overall Streptococcus pneumoniae (44%) was the most common pathogen isolated followed by Haemophilus influenzae (37%), Moraxella catarrhalis (11%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (4%). S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in AOM (44%) and ROM (47%), however, H. influenzae was the most common pathogen in OMTF (40%). Among all H. influenzae, an increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains was observed from 5.2% in 2001 to 14% (P=0.04) in 2007 and this was associated with an increase in the use of amoxicillin. An increase in the number of M. catarrhalis was also observed, from 3% (9/350) in 2001 to 11% (71/628) (P=0.000003) in 2007. During the study period the incidence of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 42/211 (20%) in children with AOM; 5/35 (17%) in children with ROM and 5/17 (42%) in children with OMTF. M. catarrhalis cases increased from 8% in 2004 to 17% in 2007 (P=0.0005) and S. pyogenes decreased from 7% in 2002-2004 to 1% in 2005-2007 (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In Costa Rica, S. pneumoniae remains the most common pathogen in children with AOM and ROM whereas non-typable H. influenzae remains the most common pathogen in children with OMTF. A significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase positive H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis has been observed in recent years.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 among Costa Rican children with otitis media: clinical, epidemiological characteristics and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
AB  - BACKGROUND: After the introduction of the seven valent-pneumococcal conjugated vaccine into our National Immunization Program, it is important to establish and track local serotype distribution in order to evaluate its impact specially because serotype replacement phenomena has been described.To describe the clinical, epidemiological and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Costa Rican children with otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3. METHODS: Middle ear fluid samples were obtained from Costa Rican children with otitis media who participated in various antimicrobial clinical trials between 1992 and 2007. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified according to laboratory standard procedures. Strains were serotyped and antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and levofloxacin was determined by E-test. RESULTS: Throughout 1992-2007 a total of 1919 tympanocentesis were performed in children with otitis media (median age: 19 months) and yielded a total of 1208 middle ear isolates. The most common pathogens were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 511 isolates (49%); Non-Typable Haemophilus influenzae, 386 isolates (37%); Moraxella catarrahalis, 100 isolates (9.5%); and Streptococcus pyogenes, 54 isolates (5%). Streptococcus pneumoniae serotyping was performed in 346/511 isolates (68%) recovered during years 1999-2006. The most common serotypes were 19F (101/30.0%), 14 (46/13.7%), 3 (34/10.1%), 6B (30/8.9%) and 23F (23/6.8%). Analysis performed per years showed a higher prevalence of serotype 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae during the study period 2004 and 2005. During the entire study period (1999-2006) serotype 3 was most commonly isolated in children older than 24 months (61.2% vs 40.6%;P = 0.05) and showed a lower rate of penicillin non-susceptibility (4.0% vs 18%; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 is an important pathogen in Costa Rican children with otitis media, especially in children older than 24 months of age (P = 0.05). Most serotype 3 isolates were susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins, macrolides and quinolones.
TI  - [Clinical efficacy, safety and PK-PD analysis of tebipenem pivoxil in a phase II  clinical trial in otolaryngological infections].
AB  - We conducted a double-blind intergroup comparative study investigating the efficacy, safety and PK-PD analysis of the new oral carbapenem antibacterial drug tebipenem pivoxil (TBPM-PI) for the treatment of otolaryngological infections in adults to establish the recommended clinical dosage. The primary endpoint was the clinical effect of a 7-day oral administration of TBPM-PI to subjects with confirmed cases of infection by any of the 5 major bacterial species causative for otolaryngological infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae) assigned to three groups set according to the TBPM-PI dosage, namely, a 450 mg group (150 mg t.i.d), a 500 mg group (250 mg b.i.d), and a 900 mg group (300 mg t.i.d). 1. Clinical efficacy: At the end of administration or at discontinuation, the efficacy rate for the 112 subjects in the efficacy analysis set was 72.1% (31/43 subjects) in the 450 mg group, 88.6% (31/35 subjects) in the 500 mg group, and 85.3% (29/34 subjects) in the 900 mg group. Both the 500 mg and 900 mg groups showed a high efficacy rate of over 80%. 2. Bacteriological efficacy: The disappearance rate of the pre-administration causative bacteria (5 major bacterial species) at the end of administration (at discontinuation), it was 92.2% (47/51 strains) in the 450 mg group, 94.7% (36/38 strains) in the 500 mg group, and 91.7% (33/36 strains) in the 900 mg group. All the groups showed a high disappearance rate, with no large differences among them. All strains of S. pneumoniae, including PRSP, as well as those of S. pyogenes and M. catarrhalis disappeared. The overall disappearance rate of H. influenzae was 78.6%, namely, 76.9% in the 450 mg group, 100% in the 500 mg group, and 66.7% in the 900 mg group, showing differences among the groups. 3. PK-PD: The PK-PD analysis was executed in 124 strains isolated from 111 subjects in which the plasma TBPM concentration and the MIC of causative organism were measured. The target value of the PK-PD parameter was examined from the relation between PK-PD parameter and bacteriological efficacy. The presumed target value of AUCf/MIC was 10-20, Cmaxf/MIC was 4. On the other hand, a clear relation was not found between T>MIC and the bacteriological efficacy. 4. SAFETY: The incidence of adverse reactions related to symptoms and signs was 28.8% (21/73 subjects) in the 450 mg group, 35.8% (24/67 subjects) in the 500mg group, and 30.6% (22/72 subjects) in the 900 mg group. The incidence of abnormal changes in laboratory test values was 8.2% (6/73 subjects) in the 450 mg group, 9.2% (6/65 subjects) in the 500 mg group, and 9.9% (7/71 subjects) in the 900 mg group. There were no differences in either of these categories among the groups, and the incidence was considered not to be correlated with dose. Based on the above, we considered that TBPM-PI at doses of 250 mg b.i.d (500 mg/day) promises high clinical usefulness for the treatment of otolaryngological infections in adults.
TI  - [Drug susceptibility of bacteria isolated from pediatric respiratory infections at general practitioners' clinics to pediatric antibiotics].
AB  - Four major causative bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,  Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes) of pediatric respiratory infections, 295 clinical isolates in total, were isolated at general practitioners' clinics in Sendai city, and evaluated the drug susceptibility to seven antibiotics for pediatric. Penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PRSP-PISP) were 55.8% of all S. pneumoniae isolates. The MIC90 of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in S. pneumoniae were good, 0.5-1 microg/mL, however, macrolide-resistant strains remarkably increased. As for H. influenzae, 50.0% of all isolates were ampicillin-intermediate and -resistant (MIC: > or = 2 microg/mL), the MIC90s of cephalosporin antibiotics had large differences between 0.5 to 8 microg/mL, and generally less susceptibility was shown to other antibiotics. M. catarrhalis showed less susceptibility to amoxicillin which behaved unstably to penicillinase, on the other hand, the MIC90s of other antibiotics were relatively good, 0.25-1 microg/mL. S. pyogenes remarkably tend to be resistant to macrolide antibiotics, however, the MIC90s of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics were very good, 0.03-0.06 microg/mL. Pediatric respiratory infections are required a treatment which results in inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria. Based on the results of drug susceptibility testing, we should make a proper selection of antibiotics by reference to disposition such as drug concentration in serum and transfer into cells.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of recent isolates from otorhinolaryngological infections to garenoxacin and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 339 isolates from the otorhinolaryngological  infections at the otorhinolaryngological departments at 27 universities in Japan, as well as their 108 affiliated hospitals and practitioners during January 2007 to June 2007 was determined to garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, cefditoren, and cefcapene applicable for otorhinolaryngological infections. The in vitro activities of these drugs against the isolates were compared. The quinolones including GRNX were potently active against Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains (PISP and PRSP), Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, except for MRSA, a major causative pathogens for otorhinolaryngological infection. When MIC ranges, MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 of three quinolones were compared, it was considered that GRNX was the most active of them. GRNX was potently active against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis same as that of other quinolones tested. In conclusion, GRNX exhibits a potently active against fresh isolates from otorhinolaryngological infections, and has an effective potential in the treatment of otorhinolaryngological infections.
TI  - Cefditoren versus community-acquired respiratory pathogens: time-kill studies.
AB  - The time-kill method was used to determine the bactericidal activity of cefditoren compared with oral cephalosporins, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and levofloxacin against a randomly selected group of strains isolated from community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs). Cefditoren was the only agent showing significant bactericidal activity (>or=3 log(10 )reduction of viable cells) within 4 h against all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, both penicillin-susceptible (PEN S) or -resistant (PEN R), as well as against Streptococcus pyogenes, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Against beta-lactamase positive strains of Haemophilus influenzae, cefditoren was comparable to the quinolone and more active than other cephalosporins at 24 h. Cefditoren showed the best killing kinetic profiles and this observation may be important when choosing an oral third-generation cephalosporin as initial or sequential therapy.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - In vitro ciprofloxacin resistance patterns of gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens in a teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last few decades the ever-increasing level of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has been a cause of worldwide concern. Fluoroquinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin has been used indiscriminately for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The increased use of ciprofloxacin has led to a progressive loss of bacterial susceptibility to this antibiotic. Therefore it is necessary to have update knowledge of resistance pattern of bacteria to this antibiotic so that alternate appropriate antibiotics can be used for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial infections. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trends of ciprofloxacin resistance pattern in commonly isolated gram-positive bacteria over time in a Saudi Arabian teaching hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out for ciprofloxacin susceptibility patterns of 5534 isolates of gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to microbiology laboratories at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia during the period from January 2002 to August 2005. RESULTS: Increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates with some fluctuations, among these isolates, were observed. For Staphylococcus aureus, it varied from 4.62, 1.83, 7.01 and 3.98%, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 97.92, 97.75, 87.01 and 88.26%, Streptococcus pyogenes 5.35, 4.47, 14.44 and 3.53% during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. Cirprofloxacin resistance during the years 2002, 2004 and 2005 for other isolates was as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 30.23, 23.02 and 26.47%; enterococcus group D, 43.05, 20.68 and 57.03% and non-enterococcus group D, 62.96, 76.92 and 87.50% respectively. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-positive bacterial clinical isolates particularly Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) enterococcus group D, and non-enterococcus group D, has greatly increased and ciprofloxacin no more remains the drug of choice for these infections.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of a nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility  of bacterial respiratory pathogens in patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted their second year survey, during the period from January to August, 2007. A total of 1178 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable for 1108 strains (226 Staphylococcus aureus, 257 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 206 Haemophilus influenzae, 120 Moraxella catarrhalis, 122 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 171 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was high, at 59.7%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediateresistant and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 30.4% and 5.1%, respectively. Among Haemophilus influenzae strains, 19.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately-resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamasenon-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 6.7% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was not isolated. Two isolates (1.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including one (0.6%) suspected multidrug-resistant strain showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies and for investigations to control resistant infections as well. Continued surveillance is required to prevent the further spread of these antimicrobial resistances.
TI  - New semiphysiological absorption model to assess the pharmacodynamic profile of cefuroxime axetil using nonparametric and parametric population pharmacokinetics.
AB  - Cefuroxime axetil is widely used to treat respiratory tract infections. We are not aware of a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for cefuroxime axetil. Our objectives were to develop a semiphysiological population PK model and evaluate the pharmacodynamic profile for cefuroxime axetil. Twenty-four healthy volunteers received 250 mg oral cefuroxime as a suspension after a standardized breakfast. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for drug analysis, NONMEM and S-ADAPT (results reported) were used for parametric population PK modeling, and NPAG was used for nonparametric population PK modeling. Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict the duration for which the non-protein-bound-plasma concentration was above the MIC (fT(>MIC)). A model with one disposition compartment, a saturable and time-dependent drug release from the stomach, and fast drug absorption from the intestine yielded precise (r > 0.992) and unbiased curve fits and an excellent predictive performance. The apparent clearance was 21.7 liters/h (19.8% coefficient of variation [CV]) and the volume of distribution 38.7 liters (18.3% CV). Robust (>or=90%) probabilities of target attainment (PTAs) were achieved by 250 mg cefuroxime given every 12 h (q12h) or q8h for MICs of <or=0.375 mg/liter or <or=0.5 mg/liter, respectively, for the bacteriostasis target fT(>MIC) of >or=40% and for MICs of <or=0.094 mg/liter or <or=0.375 mg/liter, respectively, for the near-maximal-killing target fT(>MIC) of >or=65%. For the >or=40% fT(>MIC) target, the PTAs for 250 mg cefuroxime q12h were >or=97.8% for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefuroxime at 250 mg q12h or q8h achieved PTAs below 73% or 92%, respectively, for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae for susceptibility data from various countries. Depending on the MIC distribution, 250 mg oral cefuroxime q8h instead of q12h should be considered, especially for more-severe infections that require near-maximal killing by cefuroxime.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against MRSA and MRSE.
AB  - Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. Resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. This report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous Ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus. The bioreduction of the Ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Potential contribution by nontypable Haemophilus influenzae in protracted and recurrent acute otitis media.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Characterization of acute otitis media (AOM) caused by nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is important, particularly in view of the efforts to develop vaccines against NTHi. To characterize NTHi AOM a large database of culture-positive AOM cases was analyzed. METHODS: All culture-positive AOM episodes (NTHi, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) in children <5 years old from 1999 through 2006, processed in our center were included. One isolate was counted per episode (< or = 30 days). Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from charts or by telephone interviews. Multivariable regression analysis models were used. RESULTS: Twelve thousand eight hundred twenty-three (8145 culture-positive) episodes were included. NTHi was recovered in 4928 episodes; S. pneumoniae in 4399 episodes, M. catarrhalis in 499, and S. pyogenes in 447 episodes. Independent risk factors for NTHi AOM (in culture-positive episodes) were: winter (odds ratio [OR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.33, P = 0.006); bilateral AOM (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.12-1.42, P < 0.001); >3 previous AOM episodes (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.11-1.47, P = 0.001); and antibiotic consumption in previous month (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.15-1.46, P < 0.001). ORs for these variables remained significant when the analysis was conducted on single-pathogen AOM only. For both NTHi and S. pneumoniae, risk factors for mixed episodes were older age and bilateral AOM. CONCLUSION: NTHi AOM is characterized by higher occurrence in winter, bilaterality, recurrence, and previous antibiotic treatment compared with that caused by S. pneumoniae. These findings are in agreement with data associating NTHi with protracted or recurrent morbidity. The finding that S. pneumoniae and NTHi mixed episodes are more likely to occur in older children and in bilateral AOM suggests that interaction between these 2 pathogens contributes to chronicity or complexity of AOM.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in E. coli.
AB  - The increased synthesis of building blocks of IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) and DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. Using E. coli as a host, IPP and DMAPP supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign MVA (mevalonate) pathway into it. The MVA pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-CoA, and IPP and DMAPP from mevalonate, respectively. The bottom portions of MVA pathway from Streptococcus pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant Escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. The E. coli harboring the bottom MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. The top portions of MVA pathway were also compared and the top MVA pathway of E. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in E. coli. The whole MVA pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis, respectively. The recombinant E. coli harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without exogenous mevalonate supplementation. When comparing various E. coli strains - MG1655, DH5alpha, S17-1, XL1-Blue and BL21 - the DH5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. Using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. The recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/L at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).
TI  - [Low prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with acute pharyngitis].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to determine the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pediatric patients with acute pharyngitis and in a healthy control group. METHODS: Prospective study conducted April and June 2006 of children with acute pharyngitis. M. pneumoniae infection was determined by PCR in pharyngeal exudate specimens from these patients and a healthy control group. RESULTS: A total of 182 cases and 60 controls were enrolled. PCR for M. pneumoniae was positive in 7 cases (3.8%, 95% CI 1.5-7.7) and negative in all controls. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of acute pharyngitis due to M. pneumoniae is low in our setting. In healthy patients (control group) all M. pneumoniae testing by PCR was negative; therefore, the possible pathological significance of all cases of acute pharyngitis PCR-positive for M. pneumoniae should be evaluated.
TI  - Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  - Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. Here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal UGLs and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. The putative genes for UGL and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. The UGLs of these three streptococci were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. Streptococcal UGLs degraded unsaturated hyaluronate and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. Distinct from Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL, streptococcal UGLs preferred sulfated substrates. DNA microarray and Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in S. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) was determined at 1.75 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. SagUGL adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to Bacillus UGL, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. SagUGL Arg-236 was found to be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal UGLs.
TI  - Bacterial tracheitis: a multi-centre perspective.
AB  - The published literature on bacterial tracheitis is limited. We report the first  multi-centre study of bacterial tracheitis together with a concise review of the literature. We conducted a retrospective study of cases admitted during the period 1993-2007 to 3 tertiary paediatric centres in the United Kingdom and 1 in Australia. A total of 34 cases were identified. 31 patients (91%) required intubation. Complications included cardiorespiratory arrest in 1, ARDS in 1, hypotension in 10, toxic shock syndrome in 1 and renal failure in 1 patient(s). Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly implicated bacterial organism, isolated from the respiratory tract in 55.8% of the cases overall. Other pathogens commonly isolated from the respiratory tract included Streptococcus pyogenes (5.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (11.8%). Viral coinfection was identified in 9 (31%) of the 29 cases in whom immunofluorescence testing was performed (influenza A in 4 cases; parainfluenza 1 in 2 cases; parainfluenza 3 in 2 cases; adenovirus in 1 case). The combined experience from 4 major paediatric intensive care units suggests that bacterial tracheitis remains a rare condition with an estimated incidence of approximately 0.1/100,000 children per year. Short-term complications were common but long-term sequelae were rare. There were no fatal outcomes, which contrasts with the high historical mortality rates and likely reflects improvements in intensive care management.
TI  - Genome dynamics in major bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria continuously encounter multiple forms of stress in their hostile environments, which leads to DNA damage. With the new insight into biology offered by genome sequences, the elucidation of the gene content encoding proteins provides clues toward understanding the microbial lifestyle related to habitat and niche. Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogenic Neisseria, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are major human pathogens causing detrimental morbidity and mortality at a global scale. An algorithm for the clustering of orthologs was established in order to identify whether orthologs of selected genes were present or absent in the genomes of the pathogenic bacteria under study. Based on the known genes for the various functions and their orthologs in selected pathogenic bacteria, an overview of the presence of the different types of genes was created. In this context, we focus on selected processes enabling genome dynamics in these particular pathogens, namely DNA repair, recombination and horizontal gene transfer. An understanding of the precise molecular functions of the enzymes participating in DNA metabolism and their importance in the maintenance of bacterial genome integrity has also, in recent years, indicated a future role for these enzymes as targets for therapeutic intervention.
TI  - Mechanism and implication of cephalosporin penetration into oropharyngeal mucosa.
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism(s) by which oral cephalosporins penetrate into human oropharyngeal mucosa, and thus, the availability of sufficient concentrations at the site of infection. Two oral cephalosporin prototypes, cephalexin (first generation) and cefixime (third generation), were administered to five healthy subjects at two different visits with a 1-week washout period. Plasma and saliva samples were collected and drug concentrations were measured using an appropriate HPLC method. The maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of cefixime and cephalexin were 2.97+/-0.24 microg ml(-1) and 77.65+/-18.91 microg ml(-1), respectively. These concentrations were associated with a maximum salivary concentration (CSmax) of 0.56 microg ml(-1) for cefixime and 3.34 microg ml(-1) for cephalexin. Such levels exceed the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The average concentration of cefixime in saliva corresponded to its plasma free fraction (saliva/plasma [S/P] ratio; 0.34). However, this observation was not true for cephalexin, for which antibiotic concentrations in the saliva did not appear to correspond to its plasma free fraction (0.8-0.85), with an S/P ratio of only 0.092. Our findings indicate that an active transport mechanism exists for cefixime excretion into human oropharyngeal mucosa, whereas cephalexin is passively diffused, although to a limited extent, as measured by its salivary concentrations.
TI  - Defining the structural basis of human plasminogen binding by streptococcal surface enolase.
AB  - The flesh-eating bacterium group A Streptococcus (GAS) binds and activates human  plasminogen, promoting invasive disease. Streptococcal surface enolase (SEN), a glycolytic pathway enzyme, is an identified plasminogen receptor of GAS. Here we used mass spectrometry (MS) to confirm that GAS SEN is octameric, thereby validating in silico modeling based on the crystal structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae alpha-enolase. Site-directed mutagenesis of surface-located lysine residues (SEN(K252 + 255A), SEN(K304A), SEN(K334A), SEN(K344E), SEN(K435L), and SEN(Delta434-435)) was used to examine their roles in maintaining structural integrity, enzymatic function, and plasminogen binding. Structural integrity of the GAS SEN octamer was retained for all mutants except SEN(K344E), as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and MS. However, ion mobility MS revealed distinct differences in the stability of several mutant octamers in comparison with wild type. Enzymatic analysis indicated that SEN(K344E) had lost alpha-enolase activity, which was also reduced in SEN(K334A) and SEN(Delta434-435). Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that the capacity to bind human plasminogen was abolished in SEN(K252 + 255A), SEN(K435L), and SEN(Delta434-435). The lysine residues at positions 252, 255, 434, and 435 therefore play a concerted role in plasminogen acquisition. This study demonstrates the ability of combining in silico structural modeling with ion mobility-MS validation for undertaking functional studies on complex protein structures.
TI  - Epidemiologic and microbiologic characteristics of culture-positive spontaneous otorrhea in children with acute otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the epidemiologic and microbiologic characteristics of acute otitis media (AOM) with spontaneous otorrhea in children and compare it with AOM with intact tympanic membrane in children who underwent tympanocentesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All infants and young children aged <3 years with culture-positive AOM of < or =7 days duration diagnosed during 1999 to 2006 and in whom epidemiologic and microbiologic data were available, were analyzed. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes were considered true AOM pathogens. Multivariable regression analysis models adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, seasonality, previous antibiotics, AOM history, tympanocentesis history, and pathogens isolated, were used. RESULTS: Of 12,617 AOM patients from whom a middle ear fluid was obtained, 5247 (42%) culture-positive patients were enrolled; spontaneous otorrhea was observed in 822 (15%) patients. Patients with spontaneous otorrhea were older than patients with AOM who underwent tympanocentesis (15.8 +/- 8.2 vs. 9.7 +/- 6.7 months, respectively, P < 0.01; 36.9% vs. 69.1%, respectively, were <12 months, P < 0.01). S. pyogenes was found in a higher proportion (47/822, 5.7% vs. 44/4425, 1%, P < 0.01) and H. influenzae in a lower proportion (264/822, 32.1% vs. 1805/4425, 40.8%, P < 0.01) among patients with spontaneous otorrhea than in patients with AOM and tympanocentesis. In the multivariate model, Bedouin ethnicity (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.7, P < 0.001), age (OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.11, P < 0.001) for each consecutive month, lack of antibiotic treatment for the 48 hours preceding diagnosis (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.7-2.6, P < 0.001), > or =1 previous AOM episode (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 2.6-4.0, P < 0.001), >1 previous tympanocentesis (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.4-1.7, P = 0.001), and infection with S. pyogenes (OR: 8.2, 95% CI: 5.4-12.3, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AOM presenting as spontaneous otorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: AOM presenting as spontaneous otorrhea in patients less than 3 years of age is characterized by older age, previous repeated tympanocenteses, > or =1 previous AOM episodes, lack of recent antibiotic treatment, and infection with S. pyogene.
TI  - [Correlation between antibiotic prescription and decreased antimicrobial resistance in the health area of Zamora].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the trends in prescribing antibiotics and analyze a possible relationship with the evolution of antimicrobial sensitivity in respiratory pathogens isolated in the health area of Zamora (Spain). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive study investigating the prescription of antimicrobials and the evolution of resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, from 1996 to 2005. Antibiotic use is expressed in doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DHD). The chi(2) test, exact tests, Spearman correlation coefficients, and a time series analysis were used to analyze the trends. RESULTS: A total of 1301 S. pyogenes strains were isolated. All were sensitive to penicillin, with decreasing percentages of resistance to erythromycin and increasing percentages of resistance to clindamycin. Among 579 pneumococcal strains isolated, a significant decreasing resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic, cefotaxime and cefuroxime was observed; resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin increased during the first few years, but decreased later. Among a total of 769 strains of H. influenzae, all were sensitive to cefotaxime and highly sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime; resistance to ampicillin was maintained and there was a significant decreasing resistance to azithromycin. Simultaneously, there was a progressive decrease in overall antibiotic use (20.45 DHD in 1996; 18.90 DHD in 2005). Prescription of penicillins remained stable, with increased use of amoxicillin-clavulanic, decreased use of cephalosporins and macrolides (except azithromycin), and increased use of fluorquinolones. We observed a significant correlation between prescription and resistance. CONCLUSIONS: A recovery of sensitivity to antibiotics was seen in respiratory pathogens parallel to a progressive decrease in prescription of antibiotics.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Novel ureas and thioureas of 15-membered azalides with antibacterial activity against key respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The new ureas and thioureas of 15-membered azalides, N''-substituted 9a-(N'-carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl) (4), 9a-(N'-thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl) (6), 9a-[N'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-N'-(carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)] (8) and 9a-[N'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-N'-(thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)] (10) of 9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A (2), were synthesized and structurally characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. The new compounds were evaluated in vitro against a panel of erythromycin susceptible and erythromycin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. These compounds displayed an excellent overall antibacterial in vitro activity against erythromycin sensitive gram-positive strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and good against negative strains, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. In addition, several ureas with naphthyl substituents (4f, 4g, 4h) showed better activity in comparison to azithromycin against inducible resistant S. pyogenes. Ureas with naphthyl substituents 4g, 4h and thiourea 8h displayed moderate activity against constitutively resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Efficacy and safety of faropenem in pediatric patients with bacterial infectious diseases].
AB  - The only oral penem antibiotic, faropenem (FRPM: Farom Dry Syrup for pediatrics), is one of the few antibiotics that exerts potent antibacterial activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and the dosage and administration schedule has been established for children. We studied the efficacy and safety of the drug in 113 pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate bacterial infectious diseases: upper respiratory tract infection (pharyngitis or tonsillitis), acute bronchitis, otitis media and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patients were administered oral FRPM at the dose of 15-30 mg/kg/day three times a day for 3 to 8 days (or 5 to 14 days for group A streptococcal infection). The study drug was found to be clinically effective in 63/70 cases (90.0%) of upper respiratory tract infection, 6/7 cases of acute bronchitis, 16/17 cases (94.1%) of otitis media and 6/6 cases of UTI. FRPM was demonstrated to have very potent antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae, with a high bacteriological eradication rate. No serious adverse drug reactions were observed. The only side effect was diarrhea in 12.5% of the patients (14/112 cases). There was little difference in the incidence of diarrhea between FRPM and other oral beta-lactam antibiotics. Compliance with FRPM was found to be very good in this study. These findings suggest that FRPM is as useful for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in children as oral penicillin and cephem antibiotics.
TI  - Microbiology of otitis media: a moving target.
AB  - The microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) is linked to the nasopharyngeal commensal flora. This respiratory ecosystem undergoes various selective pressures, such as antibiotic consumption and vaccine use. Socio-economic conditions also influence the bacterial composition of the nasopharynx. Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and group A Streptococcus are the leading causes of bacterial AOM worldwide. This paper will discuss the causes and consequences of recent shifts in the underlying microbiology of AOM.
TI  - Pediatric parapneumonic pleural effusions: experience in a university central hospital.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pleural effusions can complicate pneumonias in children and adolescents and are usually associated with a long hospital stay and increased morbidity. AIMS: To characterise a population of patients with parapneumonic pleural effusion and to establish possible prognostic factors on admission based on clinical, imaging and analytical data. To correlate treatment options with the outcome. METHODS: Case review of patients under 18 years old with parapneumonic pleural effusion, admitted between July 1997 - June 2004 (7 years). RESULTS: 118 patients were included, 60% male, with mean age 7 years. The incidence of pleural effusion increased throughout the period of the study. The admissions occurred predominantly in autumn and winter. On admission 60% of patients had respiratory distress and 39% chest pain. In 40% loculations were found on admission and were associated with longer hospital stay, longer course of antibiotic therapy and more frequent need for surgery. Thoracentesis was performed in 72% of patients (mean pH pleural fluid 7.24). The aetiologic agent was identified in 17% of cases: Streptococcus pneumoniae (five), Staphylococcus aureus (four) and Streptococcus pyogenes (four). In our study, 52% of patients underwent pleural drainage and 18% surgery. Median length of hospital stay was 15 days with mean 16.4 days (2 - 51). DISCUSSION: Factors associated with worse prognosis were respiratory distress, loculations, empyema, low pH in pleural fluid, glucose or proteins in pleural fluid, high lactic dehydrogenase level in pleural fluid and high serum C-reactive protein. Pleural drainage and/or surgery can shorten hospital stay and improve outcome. CONCLUSION: Complicated parapneumonic pleural effusions are managed successfully in centres with experience in the different types of procedure that might be necessary.
TI  - In vitro compared activity of telithromycin and azithromycin against northwest Italian isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with different erythromycin susceptibility.
AB  - AIMS: This study compared the in vitro activity of telithromycin with that of azithromycin against 438 Streptococcus pyogenes and 198 Streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated over the period 2005-2007 from specimens of different human origin obtained in three Piemonte Region's hospitals. METHODS AND RESULTS: The determination of antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the microdilution broth method and the erythromycin-resistant (Ery-R) phenotypes by the triple-disc test. Exactly 78.8% of S. pyogenes and 69.2% of S. pneumoniae were erythromycin-susceptible (Ery-S). Concerning S. pyogenes, telithromycin was active against M and inducible MLS(B), subtype-C, phenotypes but not against constitutive MLS(B) strains. Telithromycin acted well against all S. pneumoniae, irrespective of their mechanism of macrolide-resistance. On the contrary, the Ery-R isolates, both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, were resistant to azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that macrolide resistance in streptococci still persist in northwest Italy (21.2% of S. pyogenes and 308% of S. pneumoniae) and that telithromycin is confirmed as being extremely active even against recent clinical Ery-R streptococcal isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study emphasizes that an active surveillance of the phenotype distribution and antibacterial resistance in streptococci is essential in guiding the effective use of empirical treatment option for streptococcal infections, also at regional level.
TI  - Activity of the new cephalosporin ceftaroline against bacteraemia isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The activity of ceftaroline, a novel cephalosporin, was evaluated against 1337 isolates from patients with bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalisation (including 119 Haemophilus influenzae, 9 Moraxella catarrhalis, 164 Staphylococcus aureus, 1007 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 38 Streptococcus pyogenes). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, and susceptibility category assessments were made using CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakpoints. Ceftaroline MICs were < or = 0.008-0.06 mg/L against H. influenzae, 0.25-2mg/L against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 0.06-1mg/L against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, 0.015-0.5mg/L against M. catarrhalis and < or = 0.008-0.5mg/L against S. pneumoniae, and all S. pyogenes isolates had ceftaroline MICs < or = 0.008mg/L. Ceftaroline was more active than ceftriaxone or cefepime both against MRSA and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. More than 90% of MRSA isolates were resistant to clarithromycin and levofloxacin but were susceptible to linezolid or tigecycline. A high rate of clarithromycin resistance was also observed in the pneumococci. Ceftaroline was very active in vitro against all CAP isolates, including MRSA and penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci, in contrast to the other beta-lactams tested. These data confirm ceftaroline as a new cephalosporin with enhanced anti-Gram-positive activity and suggest that ceftaroline has the potential to be a useful new agent in the treatment of CAP-associated bacteraemic infections.
TI  - Novel biaryl oxazolidinones: in vitro and in vivo activities with pharmacokinetics in an animal model.
AB  - RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276, the new investigational oxazolidinones, have an extended spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive pathogens and showed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) lower than comparator drugs. MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) values of RBx 1000075, RBx 1000276 and linezolid against the isolates tested were, respectively: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25, 1 and 4 microg/mL; methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 0.5, 2 and 4 microg/mL; methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.25, 1 and 2 microg/mL; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 0.5, 1 and 2 microg/mL; and enterococci, 0.25, 1 and 4 microg/mL. Against respiratory pathogens, MIC(90) values were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.125, 0.5 and 2 microg/mL; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1, 0.5 and 2 microg/mL; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.5, 2 and 4 microg/mL. In vivo efficacies of RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 were evaluated in murine systemic infection against S. aureus (MRSA 562) and in a pulmonary infection model against S. pneumoniae ATCC 6303. In murine systemic infection, RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 showed efficacy against MRSA 562, exhibiting a 50% effective dose (ED(50)) of 6.25 and 9.92 mg/kg body weight for once-daily administration and 4.96 and 5.56 mg/kg body weight for twice-daily administration, respectively, whereas for linezolid the corresponding ED(50) values were 9.9 and 5.56 mg/kg body weight. In pulmonary infection with S. pneumoniae ATCC 6303, 50% survival was observed with RBx 1000075 at 50mg/kg once daily, whereas 60% survival was observed with RBx 1000276 at 50mg/kg thrice daily. The absolute oral bioavailabilities of RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 were 48% and 73%, with half-lives of 13.5 and 3.2h, respectively. RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 are promising investigational oxazolidinones against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Beta-lactam effects on mixed cultures of common respiratory isolates as an approach to treatment effects on nasopharyngeal bacterial population dynamics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae are bacteria present in the nasopharynx as part of normal flora. The ecological equilibrium in the nasopharynx can be disrupted by the presence of antibiotics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A computerized two-compartment pharmacodynamic model was used to explore beta-lactam effects on the evolution over time of a bacterial load containing common pharyngeal isolates by simulating free serum concentrations obtained with amoxicillin (AMX) 875 mg tid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) 875/125 mg tid and cefditoren (CDN) 400 mg bid regimens over 24 h. Strains and MICs (microg/ml) of AMX, AMC and CDN were: S. pyogenes (0.03, 0.03 and 0.015), S. pneumoniae (2, 2 and 0.25), a beta-lactamase positive H. influenzae (BL(+); >16, 2 and 0.06) and a beta-lactamase positive AMC-resistant H. influenzae (BLPACR, >16, 8 and 0.06). Mixture of identical 1:1:1:1 volumes of each bacterial suspension were prepared yielding an inocula of approximately 4 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Antibiotic concentrations were measured both in bacterial and in bacteria-free antibiotic simulations. beta-lactamase production decreased AMX concentrations and fT(>MIC) against S. pneumoniae (from 43.2% to 17.7%) or S. pyogenes (from 99.9% to 24.9%), and eradication was precluded. The presence of clavulanic acid countered this effect of co-pathogenicity, and S. pyogenes (but not BL(+) and S. pneumoniae) was eradicated. Resistance of CDN to TEM beta-lactamase avoided this co-pathogenicity effect, and CDN eradicated S. pyogenes and H. influenzae strains (fT(>MIC) >58%), and reduced in 94% S. pneumoniae counts (fT(>MIC) approximately 25%). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Co-pathogenicity seems to be gradual since clavulanic acid countered this effect for strains very susceptible to AMX as S. pyogenes but not for strains with AMX MIC values in the limit of susceptibility as S. pneumoniae. There is a potential therapeutic advantage for beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporins with high activity against streptococci.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefditoren against major community-acquired respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy.
AB  - In this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren--a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin--and other comparator agents against 2,396 fresh isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, collected from 6 clinical Italian microbiology laboratories. On penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and Streptococcus pyogenes, cefditoren demonstrated to be the most active antibiotic (MIC(90)values of 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L respectively), showing only a slight decrease in potency on penicillin-intermediate and resistant pneumococci (MIC(90)value 0.5 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L respectively). All the other comparators displayed MIC(90 )values of 4 - 8 mg/L for penicillins and of 4 to >64 mg/L for the oral cephalosporins. Cefditoren and levofloxacin were the most active against MSSA (MIC(90)0.5 mg/mL). Cefditoren displayed a uniformly potent inhibitory activity (MIC(90)of 0.03 mg/L) against all strains of Haemophilus influenzae, regardless of their ampicillin resistance (mediated or not by beta-lactamase production), while against Moraxella catarrhalis MIC(90)values were higher against beta-lactamase-positive (0.25 mg/L). Cefditoren was active also against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli : in this case its activity was comparable with that of levofloxacin. In conclusion, cefditoren, due to its potent activity, is a new effective therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - The prevalence of erythromycin resistance in group B streptococcal isolates at a  University Hospital in Taiwan.
AB  - Due to reduced antibiotic consumption in Taiwan, erythromycin resistance rate had decreased in Streptococcus pyogenes, but it increased in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The objectives of the present study were (1) to determine the erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rate and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the group B streptococcus (GBS) clinical isolates, and (2) to investigate the mechanism responsible for the macrolide, lincosamide, and group B streptogramin (MLS(B)) resistance. A total of 1,395 GBS isolates were collected from June 2001 to April 2007. Forty-four percent of the GBS isolates were resistant to erythromycin, and 39% were resistant to clindamycin. The annual erythromycin resistance rate increased from 32% in 2001 to 51% in 2004; a significant decrease was observed in 2005 (47%), 2006 (42%), and 2007 (38%). Percentage of erythromycin-resistant isolates with erm(B) gene significantly increased from 72% in 2001 to 90% in 2007. We found that the plasmid encoded zeta gene was present in 13% of the resistant isolates, along with erm(B). When compared to our previous study (1991 to May 2001), the overall erythromycin resistance rate increased from 30% to 44%. erm(B) was the major resistant determinant, and zeta toxin encoding plasmid has a limited role in mediating erythromycin resistance unlike in GAS isolates as reported earlier.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Pakistan--the active study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are amongst the most wide spread  and serious infections, accounting for over 50 million deaths globally each year. In developing countries, infants under 4 years of age are at greatest risk of lower RTIs, whereas in developed countries the severity of infection and rate of mortality are greater in elderly. The objective of the survey was to determine the in vitro susceptibility of antibiotics commonly prescribed RTIs against Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Streptococcus pyogenes, isolated from patients with community-acquired RTIs globally. This survey involved 9 countries. In this study we present the results from Pakistan where SP and HI only were tested. METHODS: A total of 200 isolates were included in the study. Both SP and HI were in equal number. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and E test for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. For non-US products the Committee of the Antibiogram of the French Society of Microbiology Breakpoints was used. RESULTS: All SP were found susceptible to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclave and cefixime, 72% isolates were found sensitive to macrolide and 97% to levofloxacin. All HI were found sensitive to co-amoxiclave and to cefixime, 97% to ampicillin, 98% to clarithromycin and 99% to levofloxacin. CONCLUSION: In isolates collected from Pakistan, SP resistance rate was elevated for macrolide. SP and HI remain susceptible to beta-lactams as well as to levofloxacin.
TI  - Experiences in prevention and control of antibiotic resistance in Slovenia.
AB  - During 1991-1999 a significant increase of consumption of macrolides and fluoroquinolones was observed in Slovenia,and this was associated with significant increase of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes to macrolides and Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones, respectively.Between 1999 and 2007 the prevalence of S. pneumoniae resistant to erythromycin increased from 3.7% to 16.8% even though the use of macrolides in the same period decreased from 3.81 to 2.43 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants and per day. The co-resistance and the spread of resistant clones were the reason for constant increase in macrolide resistance. Slovenia is one of the few European countries with decreasing prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospital care during the last years. As a result of control measures introduced in 1999,the MRSA prevalence rates decreased from 21.4% in 2000 to 8.3% in 2007.
TI  - Improvements in antibiotic prescribing by community paediatricians in the Czech Republic.
AB  - Repeated surveys among primary care paediatricians were performed annually from 1998 to 2002 in the Czech Republic. The task was to assess the prescription of antibiotics in treatment of respiratory infections in children. The results were evaluated in the light of existing guidelines and conclusions were used in a number of interventions aimed at reducing the inadequate use of antibiotics and hence preventing the potential increase of the antibiotic resistant bacteria. In addition, data on overall consumption of antibiotics in outpatient care and trends in the prevalence of resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are discussed.
TI  - A study on nosocomial pathogens in ICU with special reference to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (ICU). Present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from ICU causing nosocomial infections. Special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter. METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. Acinetobacter isolates were identified by API2ONE system. Antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by double dilution agar plate method. The plasmid profile of 26 antibiotic resistant isolates of Acinetobacter was studied. Curing of R-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing A. baumannii isolates. Plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. RESULTS: Major infections found in ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). Acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. More than 90 per cent isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. Plasmid profile of Acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. Ethidium bromide cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281, pUPI282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. Transformation frequency of E. coli HB101 with pUPI281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid DNA. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. A. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from ICU. Antibiotic sensitivity of A. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. Transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from Acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. Therefore, it is very important to target Acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Empyema: bacterial epidemiology and antibiotic resistance].
AB  - It is essential to know the epidemiology and resistance to antibiotics of the main pathogens responsible for children empyema because the bacteriological diagnosis is reached in less than half the cases. This diagnosis can be improved when using sophisticated methods of investigation, such as antigens detection, PCR... The main species involved is Streptococcus pneumoniae, then followed by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus. The pneumococcal serotypes most often involved in France are 1, 19A, 14 and 3. If some of them remain susceptible to penicillin (1,3), others may be resistant (19A, 14) and the majority are not included in the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus gordonii prophage PH15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii OMZ1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, PH15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. Phage PH15 belongs to the Siphoviridae. The complete genome sequence of PH15 was determined. The genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 ORFs. The genome of PH15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages MM1 and phiNIH1.1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. In strain OMZ1039, PH15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-tRNA gene. A plasmid, harbouring the attP site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. The phage endolysin was purified after expression in Escherichia coli and found to inhibit growth of all S. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - [PK/PD breakpoints and clinical/bacteriological effects of cefcapene pivoxil fine granules for children at free drug concentrations in pediatric patients with respiratory infection].
AB  - A post-marketing clinical study was previously conducted in pediatric patients with respiratory infection to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of cefcapene pivoxil (CFPN-PI) fine granules for children. Based on the results from this study, we evaluated PK/PD breakpoints and clinical/bacteriological effects of CFPN-PI at free drug concentrations in pediatric patients with respiratory infection to determine an effective and safe dosage regimen of CFPN-PI. The following results were obtained from 61 pediatric patients evaluated in our research. 1) The response rate of pediatric respiratory infection to CFPN-PI was 100% for laryngopharyngitis, 84.6% for acute bronchitis, 100% for tonsillitis, 100% for pneumonia and 95.8% for all. 2) The bacteriological response (eradication rate of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, etc.) of pediatric respiratory infection to CFPN-PI was 87.5% for laryngopharyngitis, 66.7% for acute bronchitis, 75.0% for tonsillitis, 63.6% for pneumonia and 73.8% for all. 3) The blood concentration simulation demonstrated that the PK/PD breakpoint exceeding the time above MIC (TAM) of 40% after administration of CFPN-PI 3 mg/kg three times daily was 0.27 microg/mL. 4) The pediatric patients with respiratory infection were stratified by the TAM (%) of CFPN-PI into 40% to 100% (TAM > or = 40% group) and 0% to 40% (TAM < 40% group) to compare the clinical and bacteriological effects of CFPN-PI. The clinical and bacteriological response rates, respectively, were 97.4% and 77.8% in the TAM > or = 40% group, and 88.9% and 62.5% in the TAM < 40% group. There was no difference in the clinical effect between the two TAM-stratified groups. On the other hand, the bacteriological effect, i.e., eradication rate, tended to be higher in the TAM > or = 40% group than in the TAM < 40% group, although the between-group difference was not statistically significant.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and antibacterial activities of novel 3,6-bicyclolide oximes:  length optimization and zero carbon linker oximes.
AB  - We designed and synthesized a series of novel 3,6-bicyclolide oximes, possessing  linkers of varying lengths to the secondary binding site. The E isomers exhibited excellent antibacterial profiles against a broad spectrum of resistant pathogens.
TI  - Sudden death caused by fulminant bacterial infection: background and pathogenesis of Japanese adult cases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze a risk factor for the onset of fulminant bacterial infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine unexpected acute death cases were clinicopathologically analysed. All cases represented the sudden onset of shock symptom, led to acute death within a few days, and later bacteremia was identified. Pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (5 cases), group A beta Hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) (3 cases), and Vibrio vulnificus (V. vulnificus) (1 case). RESULTS: Seven of the nine patients had underlying chronic illness. S. pneumoniae infection was associated with splenic dysfunction, and group A beta Hemolytic S. pyogenes and V. vulnificus infections were associated with alcoholic liver injury. Group A beta hemolytic S. pyogenes and V. vulnificus infections involved necrotizing fasciitis, and alcoholic liver cirrhosis was confirmed in two of the four patients. CONCLUSION: Despite the different type of bacteria, the onset of fulminant bacterial infection depended upon depressed bacterial phagocytosis in the liver or spleen. Underlying chronic illnesses should be identified as a predisposing common risk factor. It is important to understand the relations between underlying chronic illness and the onset of fulminant infection.
TI  - The first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. Part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from January to August 2006. With the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout Japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 Staphylococcus aureus, 200 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 Streptococcus pyogenes, 165 Haemophilus influenzae, 91 Moraxella catarrhalis, 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the Central Laboratory of the Research Center for Anti-infective Drugs of the Kitasato Institute, according to recommendations issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). Three (2.1%) of the 143 P. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. Through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult RTI to various antibacterial agents. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.
TI  - Determination of antibacterial activity of polyenzyme preparations Gumseb using in vitro methods.
AB  - A novel polyenzyme formulation Gumseb developed by Advanced Enzyme Technologies Ltd, Thane and Speciality Biochemicals Co., USA, was tested for antibacterial properties using ATCC strains and clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A modified antibiotic susceptibility test was used for the purpose. S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were found to be sensitive to the formulation at the chosen concentration. Next, to study the interaction between Gumseb and currently used antibiotic, a checkerboard Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) was carried out for each organism. The assay was carried out with the aim of establishing whether the polyenzyme formulation had any potentiating effect on the antibiotic of choice. Synergistic effect was established when Gumseb was used in conjunction with penicillin against S. pyogenes. Partial synergy was established when it was used in conduction with Ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa and with Ciprofloxacin against methicillin sensitive, coagulase positive S. aureus. Antagonism was established when it was used in conjunction with Ampicillin against E. coli, with Ciprofloxacin against S. typhi and coagulase negative staphylococcal strain. The results indicate that Gumseb can be used in conjunction with those antibiotics with which a synergistic or a partially synergistic effect could be shown, as in the case of P. aerugionosa and S. aureus. These findings have particular importance since these organisms are responsible for hospital based infections and are notorious for antibiotic resistance. In cases where antagonism was established, it should not be used in combination with that particular antibiotic. However, it can be used individually since it has proved to have antibacterial activity and MIC could be determined for all five commonly encountered pathogens. Therefore, it has the potential of being a novel broad range antibacterial drug. These findings are significant given the alarming rise in incidence of antibiotic resistance in most clinically important pathogens.
TI  - TrxR, a new CovR-repressed response regulator that activates the Mga virulence regulon in group A Streptococcus.
AB  - Coordinate regulation of virulence factors by the group A streptococcus (GAS) Streptococcus pyogenes is important in this pathogen's ability to cause disease. To further elucidate the regulatory network in this human pathogen, the CovR-repressed two-component system (TCS) trxSR was chosen for further analysis based on its homology to a virulence-related TCS in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In a murine skin infection model, an insertion mutation in the response regulator gene, trxR, led to a significant reduction in lesion size, lesion severity, and lethality. Curing the trxR mutation restored virulence comparable to the wild-type strain. The trxSR operon was defined in vivo, and CovR was found to directly repress its promoter in vitro. DNA microarray analysis established that TrxR activates transcription of Mga-regulated virulence genes, which may explain the virulence attenuation of the trxR mutant. This regulation appears to occur by activation of the mga promoter, Pmga, as demonstrated by analysis of a luciferase reporter fusion. Complementation of the trxR mutant with trxR on a plasmid restored expression of Mga regulon genes and restored virulence in the mouse model to wild-type levels. TrxR is the first TCS shown to regulate Mga expression. Because it is CovR repressed, TrxR defines a new pathway by which CovR can influence Mga to affect pathogenesis in the GAS.
TI  - Effects of a low concentration hypochlorous Acid nasal irrigation solution on bacteria, fungi, and virus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Saline irrigation would be more effective for chronic sinusitis patients if it had bactericidal effects. Low concentrations of hypochlorous acid may be used as a nasal irrigation solution. First, we developed a 0.85% NaCl solution by adding NaCl to tap water (pH 7.0 and 8.4) and measuring the concentration of free chlorine and hypochlorous acid after giving the solution a short electrical impulse of 20 seconds. Then we investigated whether the derived hypochlorous acid had a toxic effect on human primary nasal epithelial cells, if and what effect it had on the expression of mucin genes, and, finally, if it had bactericidal, fungicidal, or virucidal effects. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biochemical experiment. METHODS: We treated human primary nasal epithelial cells with 3.5 ppm of hypochlorous acid and then examined the cells for cytotoxicity. We also investigated the bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal effects by challenging the cells with the following microorganisms Aspergillus fumigatus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida albicans, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. To study the virucidal effects of HOCl, we used the human influenza A virus to challenge the cells. RESULTS: : In the cytotoxicity assay and in the morphological examination, the cells did not show anytoxicity at 30 minute or 2 hours after treatment with HOCl. More than 99% of bactericidal or fungicidal activity was noted for all species, except for Candida albicans, in tap water at either pH 7.0 or 8.4. In addition, a 3.2-log10 reduction was achieved in cells challenged with the human influenza A virus. CONCLUSIONS: A low concentration HOCl solution can be used as an effective nasal irrigation solution.
TI  - ["Antibiotics only when necessary" campaign in the Alpes-Maritimes district: no negative impact on invasive infections in children in the community 1998-2003].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A multidisciplinary group (for the study and prevention of infections in children, GEPIE) conducted a local public health campaign to improve antibiotic prescribing in pediatric outpatient care in the Alpes-Maritimes district. This campaign included peer-conducted academic-detailing (educational outreach) visits in 2000 and 2003. Practitioners often report during both focus groups and the GEPIE visits that they prescribe antibiotics because of a fear of subsequent complications. This study therefore sought to explore the trends in invasive diseases related to bacterial respiratory pathogens. METHODS: A retrospective survey examined the incidence in the district of invasive infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Neisseria meningitidis from 1998 through 2003 among children aged 1 month to 15 years. All local laboratories were asked for all reports of blood cultures (as well as spinal, synovial, pericardiac, peritoneal, and pleural fluid cultures) positive for these bacteria in the study population over the study period. Resistance and serotype data were recorded. RESULTS: Over the 6-year study period, there were 113 cases of invasive infections: 64% due to S. pneumoniae, 26% to N. meningitidis, 6% to H. influenzae, and 4% to S. pyogenes. There was no statistically significant difference in the annual average incidence rate before and during the campaign. The overall incidence rate was 11.2 cases per 100,000; meningitis accounted for 4.2, and invasive pneumococcal diseases 7.2 (42.7 per 100,000 children younger than 2 years). Pneumococcal resistance rates to penicillin and erythromycin did not change significantly. DISCUSSION: Two local cross-sectional studies at daycare centers in 1999 and 2002 showed a 9% reduction in the proportion of children who received antibiotics. The stability of invasive infection in children and of bacterial resistance during the campaign is reassuring. The campaign's risk/benefit ratio appears positive. CONCLUSION: These results encourage continuing promotion of rational antibiotic prescribing and ought to allay practitioners' fears about the consequences of prescribing antibiotics less often.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - [Colonization (infection) of the respiratory tract in outpatients in 2000-2005 years].
AB  - Infections of the respiratory tract are one of the main causes of family doctor visiting. A variety of etiological factors (mostly viruses, typical and non typical bacteria) causes that the diagnosis of these infections is rarely made in outpatient practice (usually these are nose and throat smears); additionally the carrier state of typical bacteria in the respiratory tract impedes the interpretation of microbiological results. THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to assess the incidence of potential bacterial etiological factors of respiratory tract infections in outpatients in the years 2000-2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 3270 microbiological results obtained from patients at the age of between 1 month and 88 years old with chronic and acute symptoms of respiratory tract infections were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive results of bacteria culture indicating the possible bacterial etiological agent of infection were found from 1051 patients (34.4%), mostly in autumn - spring time. Most often were isolated: H. influenzae - 28.8%, S. pneumoniae - 22.1% and S. aureus - 22.1%, in less percentage M. catarrhalis - 14.1% and S. pyogenes - 13.1. Positive bacteria cultures were received most often from ear secretion- 66.8% (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus), from nose-41.2% (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae), sputum - 34.9% (S. aureus), throat - 24.3% (H. influenzae, S. pyogenes). CONCLUSIONS: It has been confirmed that predominant participation of viruses in respiratory system infections is observed and also seasonal character of their bacterial nature occurrence (35%). Most often were isolated: H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, also M. catarrhalis. On the ground of carrier state of these bacteria in nasopharynx it is a clinician's decision to recognize the bacteria as the etiological agent of infection and possible use of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Application of genomics in bacterial vaccine discovery: a decade in review.
AB  - The combined power of genomics and proteomics has led to many advances in the discovery of bacterial vaccine targets. The 'Holy Grail' for a vaccine is to be pathogen specific yet conserved among all strains, so that universal coverage is possible with the minimal number of antigens. Genomics allows us to target conserved proteins, while proteomics tells us what is actually expressed and what is accessible to antibodies. Achievements using these latest approaches are exemplified by the vaccine clinical trials that are ongoing for protein targets against Neiserria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus along with promising discoveries that have been made for other pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. These developments are discussed in this review.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and Etest.
AB  - The current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical U.S. isolates of target pathogens. Findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized Etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (BMD) surveillance (D. C. Draghi et al., Poster D-0701, 46th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., San Francisco, CA). Differences were noted among Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus pyogenes. To address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by BMD and Etest. In all, 1,800 Staphylococcus aureus, 259 S. pyogenes, 226 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 Enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 Enterobacteriaceae, and 227 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. Tigecycline had potent activity by BMD, with >99.6% susceptibility (%S) observed for all pathogens with interpretive criteria, excluding Enterobacter cloacae (98.3% S) and E. faecalis (86.0% S), and MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (S. pyogenes/S. pneumoniae) to 1 mug/ml (Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii). Similar profiles were observed by Etest, with the exception of A. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens Etest MICs trended one doubling-dilution higher than BMD MICs. Major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding A. baumannii, S. marcescens, and S. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in MICs were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. Further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline Etest for testing S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., and S. pneumoniae is warranted.
TI  - The role of complex carbohydrate catabolism in the pathogenesis of invasive streptococci.
AB  - Historically, the study of bacterial catabolism of complex carbohydrates has contributed to understanding basic bacterial physiology. Recently, however, genome-wide screens of streptococcal pathogenesis have identified genes encoding proteins involved in complex carbohydrate catabolism as participating in pathogen infectivity. Subsequent studies have focused on specific mechanisms by which carbohydrate utilization proteins might contribute to the ability of streptococci to colonize and infect the host. Moreover, transcriptome and biochemical analyses have uncovered novel regulatory pathways by which streptococci link environmental carbohydrate availability to virulence factor production. Herein we review new insights into the role of complex carbohydrates in streptococcal host-pathogen interaction.
TI  - NrdI essentiality for class Ib ribonucleotide reduction in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The Streptococcus pyogenes genome harbors two clusters of class Ib ribonucleotide reductase genes, nrdHEF and nrdF*I*E*, and a second stand-alone nrdI gene, designated nrdI2. We show that both clusters are expressed simultaneously as two independent operons. The NrdEF enzyme is functionally active in vitro, while the NrdE*F* enzyme is not. The NrdF* protein lacks three of the six highly conserved iron-liganding side chains and cannot form a dinuclear iron site or a tyrosyl radical. In vivo, on the other hand, both operons are functional in heterologous complementation in Escherichia coli. The nrdF*I*E* operon requires the presence of the nrdI* gene, and the nrdHEF operon gained activity upon cotranscription of the heterologous nrdI gene from Streptococcus pneumoniae, while neither nrdI* nor nrdI2 from S. pyogenes rendered it active. Our results highlight the essential role of the flavodoxin NrdI protein in vivo, and we suggest that it is needed to reduce met-NrdF, thereby enabling the spontaneous reformation of the tyrosyl radical. The NrdI* flavodoxin may play a more direct role in ribonucleotide reduction by the NrdF*I*E* system. We discuss the possibility that the nrdF*I*E* operon has been horizontally transferred to S. pyogenes from Mycoplasma spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens in Japan during PROTEKT years 1-5 (1999-2004).
AB  - Susceptibility to a range of antimicrobial agents was determined among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae collected in 12 centers throughout Japan during years 1-5 (the respiratory seasons of 1999-2004) of the longitudinal Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin study. The most frequent source of isolates of S. pneumoniae was from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (25.3%). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin or erythromycin resistance was common among S. pneumoniae isolates (30.9-44.5% and 77.2-81.9%, respectively). The macrolide MIC(50) for S. pneumoniae was >or=128 microg/ml (azithromycin and erythromycin) and >or=64 microg/ml (clarithromycin). The erm(B) genotype accounted for the most erythromycin-resistant isolates in each study year. H. influenzae isolates were most commonly derived from patients with CAP (26.2%). The proportion of H. influenzae isolates that were beta-lactamase positive ranged between 4.3% and 9.7%. The prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates increased from 0.4% to 2.6% between years 1 and 4 then to 19.7% in year 5. S. pyogenes isolates were highly susceptible to most antimicrobial agents except macrolides and tetracycline. Telithromycin was highly active against all three pathogens examined throughout the study.
TI  - Molecular and biological characterization of histidine triad protein in group A streptococci.
AB  - Four Streptococcus pneumoniae genes, phtA, phtB, phtD, and phtE, as well as the slr gene of group A streptococci (GAS), encode proteins with a histidine triad motif (HxxHxH). Pht proteins function as protective antigens against S. pneumoniae infection. A search of the GAS genome database identified a novel protein, HtpA, possessing five histidine triad motifs. The htpA gene was shown to encode a 92.5-kDa protein located downstream of the fbaA and lbp genes, while Western blot analyses revealed that HtpA protein was expressed on the cell surfaces of all group A, B, C, and G streptococcal isolates tested. Immunization of mice with rHtpA induced antigen-specific antibody production and was effective after a single immunization, with antibody titers remaining constant for at least 84days. In addition, HtpA-immunized mice survived after challenge with GAS strains isolated from patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome for significantly longer periods than sham-immunized mice. In that experiment, the HtpA-specific antibody was effectively induced by a single immunization and the specific antibody titer remained constant for at least 84days. These results indicate that the novel histidine triad protein HtpA is a candidate vaccine for GAS infection.
TI  - [Availability of laboratory tools for microbiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in Italian hospitals].
AB  - To assess the availability of laboratory tools for microbiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection, a survey was conducted on a sample of Italian hospital laboratories during the period April-July 2005. Overall, 261 hospitals, one third of the total Italian hospitals, were randomly selected. All these laboratories were sent a standardized questionnaire collecting information on diagnostic tools available for testing a list of bacterial, viral and fungal organisms responsible for lower respiratory tract infections. Forty eight percent of the sample completed and returned the questionnaire. A part from few pathogens such as Enterobacteria, Enterococcus Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Herpes simplex e Candida spp, for which no differences in diagnostic capacity among hospitals was found, for all the other pathogens considered, significant differences among geographical areas were found.
TI  - Antistreptococcal activity of AR-709 compared to that of other agents.
AB  - Against 300 strains of pneumococci and 100 group A streptococci of differing beta-lactam, macrolide, and quinolone resistance phenotypes, AR-709 was very active, with all MICs being < or =2 microg/ml. Furthermore, AR-709 was active against strains that were both susceptible and resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - [Increase in the incidence of bacterial pneumonia between 2001 and 2004].
AB  - AIM: To study patients with typical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to our hospital between 2001 and 2004 in order to analyze the incidence of this disease in our health area during this period. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of patients with CAP admitted to our hospital from 2001 to 2004. Only those patients who fulfilled the criteria for typical pneumonia of possible bacterial origin based on clinical and radiological features and laboratory data were included. The annual incidence rates of CAP were analyzed using demographic data from our health area and from all children admitted to the infectious diseases unit of our hospital during this period. RESULTS: During the study period, 569 children were diagnosed with typical CAP: 116 in 2001, 133 in 2002, 154 in 2003 and 166 in 2004. The incidence rate was 1.3 cases/1,000 children under 14 years old/year in 2001, 1.51 in 2002, 1.69 in 2003 and 1.72 in 2004. These findings represent an increment of 25% in the incidence per 1,000/children/year and an increment of 53% in the incidence per 100 children admitted to our unit. Blood cultures were performed before antibiotic therapy was administered in 487 patients and were positive in 22 (4.5%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 patients and Streptococcus pyogenes in one. Chest radiographs revealed lobar consolidation in 95% of the patients and 15 % developed pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of CAP of probable pneumococcal etiology increased in our health area during the study period. The number of complicated cases also increased.
TI  - Baseline in vitro activity of tigecycline among key bacterial pathogens exhibiting multidrug resistance.
AB  - Tigecycline is the first clinically available semisynthetic glycylcycline approved for clinical use. This study was done to establish a baseline for ongoing surveillance of tigecycline's activity as this agent's clinical use increases. Against 1,796 Staphylococcus aureus (559 multidrug resistant), tigecycline had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC(90); 0.12 microg/ml) among all agents tested and 99.8% of the isolates were susceptible. For Acinetobacter spp., tigecycline again demonstrated the lowest MIC(90) (2 microg/ml) and the highest percent susceptibility (96.9%). Among Enterobacteriaceae, the 2 most active agents were tigecycline (MIC(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99% susceptible) and imipenem (MIC(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99.5% susceptible). Tigecycline also demonstrated high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes,Haemophilus influenzae and Enterococcus spp. In summary, tigecycline currently exhibits potent activity against a broad array of bacteria species. Given the dynamics of resistance development, careful monitoring of tigecycline activity against these organisms should remain a significant aspect of ongoing surveillance.
TI  - [Lipoteichoic and teichoic acids of pathogenic streptococci: structure, functions, and role in interaction of the infectious agent with organism].
AB  - Features of structure, localization, and function of teichoic (TA) and lipoteichoic acids (LPA) of gram-positive bacteria are shortly characterized. Structures of polymers obtained from Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae are described. The role of TA and LPA of pathogenic streptococci in different phases of infectious process and requirements for biological activity of these molecules are discussed.
TI  - Associated antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Associated resistance to four to six related and unrelated antimicrobial agents was investigated in consecutive non-duplicate isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 39 425), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1070), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 7489), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1604) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2531). In all species, high proportions (76.5-88.9%) of isolates were susceptible to all the drugs investigated. Irrespective of species, isolates resistant to one drug were more likely to be resistant to any of the other drugs than were susceptible isolates. Thus, trimethoprim resistance in E. coli was 38.4% among ampicillin-resistant vs. 3.9% among ampicillin-susceptible isolates, and erythromycin resistance in Strep. pneumoniae was 41% among doxycycline-resistant vs. 1% among doxycycline-susceptible isolates. In all five species investigated, there was also significant associated resistance among unrelated drugs, highlighting the fact that resistance development occurs primarily among bacteria already resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. For the clinician, pronounced resistance associations mean that when empirical therapy fails because of resistance, there is a reduced chance of choosing an alternative successful empirical agent. For the epidemiologist, who uses routine clinical susceptibility data to describe resistance development, resistance associations mean that if the dataset contains results for isolates selected on the basis of their susceptibility to another drug, structurally related or not, a bias of false resistance is introduced.
TI  - Seasonal distribution of otitis media pathogens among Costa Rican children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Otitis media is an important cause of pediatric consultation, and knowledge of yearly pathogen distribution might improve antimicrobial selection. OBJECTIVES: To determine the seasonal pathogen and antimicrobial resistance distribution among Costa Rican children with otitis media. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2004, 952 children with otitis media, aged 3-144 months who participated in various clinical trials, were analyzed. Data obtained from this period were compared against historical data collected between 1992 and 1997. RESULTS: Five hundred sixteen (52%) children had a baseline middle ear fluid pathogen isolated. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae 252 (49%), Haemophilus influenzae 190 (37%), S. pyogenes 38 (7%), and Moraxella catarrhalis 36 (7%). The overall proportion of H. influenzae (24-37%; P = 0.01) and the production of beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae (2.6-7%; P = 0.02) increased from 1992-1997 to 1999-2004. There was a nonstatistically significant trend for a higher frequency of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae isolates detected during the rainy season than during the dry season: S. pneumoniae 58% versus 42% but not significant (P = 0.1) and H. influenzae 68% versus 32% (P = 0.06), respectively. During the rainy season, penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae was identified more frequently (38.5%) than during the dry season (18%) (P = 0.003; odds ratio: 2.94; 95% confidence interval: 1.4-6.45). Penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae decreased from 46.5% (1999-2001) to 16% (2002-2003) and this was associated with a significant decline of a circulating 19F penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae serotype (from 89% to 26%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are the 2 most common pathogens producing otitis media in Costa Rican children. An increase in the number of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was observed in recent years. Penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae isolates were more commonly observed during the rainy season, in which increased morbidity with respiratory pathogens is observed.
TI  - A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB) assay for detection of bacterial respiratory pathogens in children with pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a novel method for simultaneous identification of 12 potential bacterial pathogens in children with community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed, to identify 12 respiratory bacterial pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Bordetella pertussis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and single (uniplex) PCRs were used for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae only. In a preliminary evaluation, we compared the results of mPCR/RLB with those of single (uniplex) PCRs and culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 100 children under 5 years, admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital between October 2004 and May 2005, with pneumonia. RESULTS: Reference strains and clinical isolates of all 12 target species were correctly identified by mPCR/RLB. Potential pathogens were isolated from one blood culture and 26% of respiratory cultures. One or more pathogens were identified in 70% of respiratory specimens--by mPCR/RLB in 63%, uPCR only in another 3%, culture only in 2%, and culture plus uPCR in 2%. The species most commonly identified were S. pneumoniae (54%) and H. influenzae (38%, including type b, 4%). Cultures were not performed for B. pertussis, M. tuberculosis, C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae but each was identified by mPCR/RLB in between one and four specimens. Two or more potential pathogens were identified in 35% of specimens. Ten of 14 S. pneumoniae isolates belonged to serotypes represented in the 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The mPCR/RLB assay is a sensitive tool for identification of respiratory pathogens, including mixed infections and bacteria requiring special culture methods.

TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - Susceptibilities of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae to macrolides and telithromycin: data from an Italian multicenter study.
AB  - 687 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and 600 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae , isolated over the period 2002-2003 from specimens of different human origin obtained in 16 different Italian centres, were assayed for their susceptibilities to different macrolides and to telithromycin, and were investigated by PCR to detect their different erythromycin resistance genes. 25.5% of the S. pyogenes isolates proved resistant to erythromycin, as well as to clarithromycin and azithromycin. 6.6% of the isolates proved non-susceptible to clindamycin. 4.9% of the isolates were non-susceptible to telithromycin. 22.3% of all erythromycin-resistant isolates exhibited cMLS B resistance, 50.3% iMLS B resistance, and 27.4% Mtype resistance. All cMLS B strains had the erm(B) gene, all M strains had the mef (A) gene, and no resistance genes were found in the erythromycin-susceptible strains. Roughly one quarter of the iMLS(B) strains had erm(A) and roughly three quarters erm(B). 35.2% of the S. pneumoniae isolates proved resistant to erythromycin, and virtually all of them also proved resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin, too. Only 6.0% of the pneumococcal isolates were resistant to penicillin and a further 11.0% were intermediate. Only 0.2% of the isolates were nonsusceptible to telithromycin. 65.9% of all erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates had cMLS B resistance, 18.0% had iMLS B resistance, and 16.1% had M-type resistance. All the MLS B-resistant isolates had an erm(B) gene, and all the M-type isolates had a mef gene. We conclude that macrolide resistance of streptococci still persists in Italy with incidences as high as 40%, more often than not being characterised by the MLS B phenotype. The ketolide telithromycin, structurally related to macrolides and most likely to substitute for them in a number of clinical uses, is confirmed as being extremely active even against recent clinical streptococcal isolates.
TI  - New genetic element carrying the erythromycin resistance determinant erm(TR) in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - erm(A) subclass erm(TR), a common macrolide resistance determinant in Streptococcus pyogenes but quite rare in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was found in a clinical S. pneumoniae isolate (AP200) from Italy. In this isolate, erm(TR) was found included in a genetic element approximately 56 kb in size that did not appear to be conjugative but could be transferred by transformation. An erm(TR)-containing DNA fragment of approximately 10 kb was sequenced and 12 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. Upstream of erm(TR), a regulatory protein of the TetR family and the two components of an efflux pump of the ABC type were found. Downstream of erm(TR), there were ORFs homologous to a spectinomycin phosphotransferase, transposases, and a relaxase. Since the genomic sequence of S. pyogenes MGAS10750 carrying erm(TR) became available, comparison between the erm(TR)-containing genetic elements in AP200 and in MGAS10750 was performed. The region flanking erm(TR) in MGAS10750 showed identity with AP200 for 10 ORFs out of 12. PCR mapping using primers designed on the sequence of MGAS10750 confirmed that AP200 carries a genetic element similar to that of MGAS10750. In AP200 the genetic element was inserted inside an ORF homologous to spr0790 of S. pneumoniae R6, coding for a type I restriction modification system. Homologies between the insertion sites in AP200 and MGAS10750 consisted of eight conserved nucleotides, of which three were duplicated, likely representing target site duplication. The structure of the erm(TR)-carrying genetic element shows characteristics of a transposon/prophage remnant chimera. In AP200 this genetic element was designated Tn1806.

TI  - Pediatric mastoiditis in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era: symptom duration guides empiric antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiology of acute otitis media has changed in the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) era. We hypothesize similar changes with pediatric mastoiditis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the etiology of mastoiditis in the pre-PCV (January 1995-December 2000) and post-PCV (January 2001- April 2005) eras to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy in the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of mastoiditis from January 1995 to April 2005. RESULTS: : One hundred twenty-two charts were reviewed, 68 pre-PCV and 54 post-PCV. Etiological agents were determined by culture results in 60 patients. The most common bacterial isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (8), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). There was no reduction in mastoiditis due to S. pneumoniae from the pre-PCV to the post-PCV eras (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-2.1; P = 0.77). Ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility was seen in 30% of post-PCV S. pneumoniae isolates compared with 7% of pre-PCV isolates. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed in 93 patients, and chronic mastoiditis (defined as >or=3 wk of symptoms) was diagnosed in 29 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely to be implicated in acute versus chronic mastoiditis (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.2-52.2; P = 0.01). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently implicated in chronic versus acute mastoiditis (OR, 16.4; 95% CI, 2.1-75.8; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the proportion of pediatric mastoiditis cases caused by S. pneumoniae in the pre-PCV versus post-PCV eras. Empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone alone is not sufficient in the post-PCV era.
TI  - A functional epitope of the pneumococcal surface adhesin A activates nasopharyngeal cells and increases bacterial internalization.
AB  - Pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) is a putative pneumococcal (Pnc) adhesin known to bind to nasopharyngeal (NP) epithelial cells. This study evaluated the effect of peptides within a functional domain of PsaA on NP cells. Detroit 562 NP cells were treated with synthetic peptides derived from PsaA (P4, P6, and P7; 28, 12, and 16 amino acids, respectively). The P4 peptide also binds to NP cells. Analysis of P4-treated NP cells by transmission electron microscopy revealed major cytological changes. Of 9 cytokines analyzed, a 6-fold increase in FGFb secretion at 3 and 6h (11-fold at 12h) was found post-P4 treatment of NP cells. There was a simultaneous reduction in the secreted levels of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF. We observed enhancement in the adherence of Pnc strains to P4-treated NP cells (2-38-fold increase). Enhancement in adherence (2-fold increase) to P4-treated NP cells was also recorded with other streptococcal species (Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus pyogenes). Internalization experiments demonstrated that 45% of the adherent bacteria were actually internalized after pretreatment with P4 peptide as compared to controls. Peptide fragments of P4, P6 and P7 did not activate NP cells to the extent of P4 peptide. The P4-mediated enhancement of Pnc adherence was blocked (100%) by anti-P4 antibodies, confirming the specificity of the P4 sequence for NP cell activation. Our data suggests that this functional domain of PsaA contained within the P4 sequence binds and activates NP cells to facilitate Pnc invasion.
TI  - Inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  - Among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. We have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, MAX1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. In experiments where MAX1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFUs)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) CFUs/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Results show that the hydrogel surface is active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. Live-dead assays employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. In addition, the surface of MAX1 hydrogels was shown to cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35. These data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. Although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. Additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. These material attributes make MAX1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.
TI  - [Epidemiology and bacteriological diagnosis of paediatric acute osteoarticular infections].
AB  - Acute paediatric osteo-articular infections require a fast and sensitive diagnosis allowing a treatment directed to the causative pathogen. Many micro-organisms can be incriminated, but Staphylococcus aureus and Kingella kingae markedly prevail. K. kingae became the first bacterial species responsible for septic arthritis in children < 3 years. More rarely, (2)haemolytic Streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae are found. The incidence of community acquired S. aureus resistant to oxacillin in osteo-articular infections is still low in France. The microbiological diagnosis of septic arthritis relies upon analysis of articular fluid, which requires systematic inoculation of a blood culture vial to increase the recovery rate of K. kingae. If the culture is negative, it is recommended to carry out a universal PCR or a PCR targeted to the main germs responsible for septic arthritis. Indeed, PCR represents an undeniable benefice for the diagnosis of paediatric septic arthritis, particularly for the DNA detection of K. kingae. The diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis relies primarily upon blood cultures, since the bone puncture is not a systematic procedure in this setting. Their efficiency is low, and there is still a need to look for other arguments of diagnosis such as search of possible portals of entry or specific serologies.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Bacteriologic comparison of tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although many bacteriology studies on tonsillar diseases have been completed, all have been confined to children and were characterized by a paucity of cases. The purpose of this study was to analyze the underlying bacterial pathogens in tonsillar disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 824 patients who underwent elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. We analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy with regard to age, season, and antibiotic sensitivity. RESULTS: Among 824 cases, 966 bacterial strains from the tonsil core were isolated. In recurrent tonsillitis, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (30.3%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (15.5%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes, 14.4%). In patients over 14 years of age, quite differently from other age groups, Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated at a significantly higher percentage. In tonsillar hypertrophy, H. influenzae was isolated most commonly (31.4%) regardless of age, followed by S. pyogenes (24.2%), S. aureus (22.9%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). Furthermore, mixed infection was common because of its high resistance to penicillin. In both groups, S. pneumoniae was more common in younger patients, whereas K. pneumoniae was relatively common in adults. We found no differences in the detection rate by season; however, H. influenzae was frequently isolated in the tonsillar hypertrophy group regardless of seasonal variations. We also found no difference in the antibiotic sensitivity between the two groups; however, strains resistant to penicillin were relatively prevalent and showed a high sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporin. CONCLUSIONS: We observed some differences in the types of bacteria in the tonsillar core between the recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy groups. Our study indicates that essential bacteria have been changing and, thus, we need to change our choice of antibiotics.
TI  - Identification of upper respiratory tract pathogens using electrochemical detection on an oligonucleotide microarray.
AB  - Bacterial and viral upper respiratory infections (URI) produce highly variable clinical symptoms that cannot be used to identify the etiologic agent. Proper treatment, however, depends on correct identification of the pathogen involved as antibiotics provide little or no benefit with viral infections. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and microarray for URI identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques, with electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. The assay was developed to detect four bacterial pathogens (Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and 9 viral pathogens (adenovirus 4, coronavirus OC43, 229E and HK, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus. This new platform forms the basis for a fully automated diagnostics system that is very flexible and can be customized to suit different or additional pathogens. Multiple probes on a flexible platform allow one to test probes empirically and then select highly reactive probes for further iterative evaluation. Because ECD uses an enzymatic reaction to create electrical signals that can be read directly from the array, there is no need for image analysis or for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment. We show assay sensitivity and specificity that are excellent for a multiplexed format.
TI  - Enolases from Gram-positive bacterial pathogens and commensal lactobacilli share  functional similarity in virulence-associated traits.
AB  - Enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. Enolases of the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as His(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant Escherichia coli. The fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. The individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. In particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.
TI  - Antimicrobial compounds from the Australian desert plant Eremophila neglecta.
AB  - A crude extract from the Australian desert plant Eremophila neglecta has recently been shown to possess antibacterial activity in a survey of candidate plants that may bear novel antimicrobial compounds. Bioassay-directed fractionation of the Et(2)O extract of E. neglecta using a broth microdilution assay led to the isolation of three new serrulatane-type diterpenoids, 2,19-diacetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-ene (2), 8,19-dihydroxyserrulat-14-ene (3), and 8-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (4), and a known o-naphthoquinone commonly referred to as biflorin (5). The structures of 2-5 were determined using 1D and 2D NMR, FTIR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Compounds 3-5 showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) ranged from 6.5 to 101.6 microM and 12.7 to 202.9 microM, respectively. No activity was observed for these compounds against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Acute otitis media: Diagnosis and treatment].
AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common causes of medical visit and antimicrobial use in children. A rationale management approach requires a thorough clinical exam and updated knowledge on local patterns of microorganisms involved and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Clinical diagnosis should be performed with pneumatic otoscopy. The most common microorganism causing AOM in Santiago, Chile according to local studies are Streptococcus pneumoniae (40%o), non-capsulated Haemophilus influenzae (29%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4%). S. pneumoniae has acquired resistance to penicillin in the last decade, resistance that has been extrapolated to other (b lactams such as amoxicillin, reason why broader spectrum antimicrobials are routinely prescribed. Clinical practice has consistently shown although that the great majority of children receiving amoxicillin at a dose of 80-100 mg/kg/day resolve their AOM. Recent studies from our group have demonstrated that resistance to penicillin can not be extrapolated to amoxicillin. In vitro high level resistance to penicillin vs amoxicillin is 18%> vs 0.5%. Based on this data, our current recommendation for AOM is amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/day, q 12 hours for 10 days in infants and for 5-7 days in children > 2 years of age who have not had an episode within the previous month. For amoxicillin failures, amoxicillin + (b lactam inhibitor or a second generation cephalosporin are recommended, especially in areas with a high prevalence of (b lactam producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Treatment of children with AOM universally require appropriate follow-up in order to comply with the proposed algorithm.
TI  - Crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2X: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. To envision the binding of cefditoren to PBPs, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of PBP 2X from S. pneumoniae strain R6 complexed with cefditoren. There are two PBP 2X molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the orientation of Trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. The methylthiazole group of the C-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues His394, Trp374, and Thr526 in molecule 1 and residues His394, Asp375, and Thr526 in molecule 2. The formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the pocket to which the C-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. These features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Prediction of upper respiratory tract bacteria in acute otitis media.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Thorough otomicroscopical examination of the tympanic membrane in acute otitis media (AOM) might distinguish AOM episodes caused by different bacteria. It thus might be a way to select appropriate treatment for each patient without raising the number of dangerous complications. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to see if it might be possible to predict the causative bacterium by judging the otomicroscopical appearance of the tympanic membrane in episodes of AOM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was prospective. Patients suffering from non-perforated AOM were included. The tympanic membrane was photographed. A prediction of the causative bacterium was made and tympanocentesis was performed. Effusion from the middle ear and a nasopharyngeal swab were obtained for bacterial culturing. The causative bacteria were categorized into gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes) or gram-negative (non-typable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis). RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were included in the study. A correct prediction was made in 47/63, a false prediction in 16/63 (kappa 0.48, p<0.001).
TI  - QSAR studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III.
AB  - Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. Components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. FabH, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of FabH and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli, which demonstrate FabH inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. The QSAR studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus). On the other side presence of hetero-atoms like N, O, or S at R(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. The comparison of QSAR between the FabH inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, N. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.
TI  - Mastoiditis in children: a prospective, observational study comparing clinical presentation, microbiology, computed tomography, surgical findings and histology.
AB  - The aim of this study was to obtain comprehensive data on clinical presentation,  microbiology, computed tomography, surgical findings and histology in acute, sub-acute and chronic mastoiditis. We performed a prospective, observational study in children under 16 years of age presenting to our institution during the 2-year period beginning in April 2000. The children were examined and their condition treated in accordance with a standardized protocol elaborated by the paediatric, otolaryngology (ORL) and radiology departments. Thirty-eight patients were hospitalized (22 with acute mastoiditis, seven with sub-acute mastoiditis, nine with chronic mastoiditis). There were 30 complications present in 21 patients (55%). Streptococcus pyogenes was the most common pathogen (7/24 cases), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (4/24 cases). Mastoid surgery was performed in 29 patients. Histology of mastoid tissue revealed predominantly acute inflammation in two cases, mixed acute/chronic inflammation in 19 cases and predominantly chronic inflammation in seven cases. Radiologic data were evaluated retrospectively. Spiral, volume-based high-resolution (HR) computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 38%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% in detecting coalescence of mastoid trabeculae. Cranial CT with contrast had a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 94%, PPV of 80% and NPV of 94% in identifying intra-cranial extension. CONCLUSION: histological evidence suggests that sub-acute/chronic infection underlies not only sub-acute and chronic mastoiditis, but most cases of acute mastoiditis as well. HR-CT of the temporal bone is effective in ruling out coalescence. Cranial CT is valuable in identifying intra-cranial extension. Cranial and HR-CT are recommended in the examination of children with mastoiditis.
TI  - Culture of body fluids using the bact/alert system.
AB  - The BacT/Alert system was evaluated for its utility to recover clinically significant bacteria from several sterile body fluids, other than blood. Of the1500 specimens processed, 530 (35.33%) cultures were recorded positive by the BacT/Alert bottles while only 379 (25%) cultures were recovered on the plate cultures. The mean time to detection was < 12 hours for Gram-negative organisms and 12 - 16 hours for the Gram-positive organisms. The rapid detection of important pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Salmonella typhi, within 12 hours of inoculation, is of particular interest especially in serious infections like deep-seated abscesses. This enabled the treating physician to start the specific and appropriate antibiotics early and facilitated a better prognosis in the patient. The system is also very efficient in the early detection of anaerobes from the clinical specimens.
TI  - Antimicrobial compounds from Eremophila serrulata.
AB  - We report a search for antimicrobial compounds in the Australian plant Eremophila serrulata. Bioassay directed fractionation of a diethyl ether extract prepared from the leaves of E. serrulata led to the isolation of two compounds, an omicron-naphthoquinone, 9-methyl-3-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]pyran-7,8-dione (2), and a serrulatane diterpenoid, 20-acetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (3). Two other known serrulatane-type diterpenoids, 8,20-dihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (4) and 8,20-diacetoxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (5) were also isolated. None of these compounds had previously been tested for antimicrobial activity. Compounds 2-5 showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 15.6 to 250mug/mL. Compound 2 was the most active with an MIC of 15.6mug/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 125mug/mL. This compound also showed antimicrobial activity against other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. No activity was observed for this compound against all Gram-negative bacteria tested.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections].
AB  - We determined the susceptibility of bacteria which were isolated from the patients with respiratory infections between January and October 2005, to tosufloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. A total of 900 isolate including 300 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 Streptococcus pyogenes, 100 Moraxella catarrhalis, 200 Haemophilus influenzae, 100 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin were used as the test antimicrobials. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were potent antibiotics tested for the antibacterial activity against Streptococcus including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae; the MIC90 were 0.12-0.5/ micromL. Fluoroquinolones exerted the potent antibacterial activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae; the MIC90 of fluoroquinolones tested were < or =0.06 microg/mL. Tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin showed to be more active against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, but parts of some strains were resistant. These results indicate that tosufloxacin has the potent antibacterial activity against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections. Since it was approved in 1990, tosufloxacin was considered to be useful as a therapeutic antimicrobial for the treatment of respiratory infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates recently  obtained in Europe.
AB  - The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 620 gram-positive isolates. For staphylococci, MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were both 0.25 microg/ml, irrespective of methicillin resistance. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml for vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and 1 and 2 microg/ml for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci were inhibited by < or =0.12 microg/ml.
TI  - Serotypes, Clones, and Mechanisms of Resistance of Erythromycin-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Isolates Collected in Spain.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the distributions of antibiotic susceptibility patterns, serotypes, phenotypes, genotypes, and macrolide resistance genes among 125 nonduplicated erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates collected in a Spanish point prevalence study. The prevalence of resistance to macrolides in this study was 34.7%. Multiresistance (to three or more antimicrobials) was observed in 81.6% of these strains. Among 15 antimicrobials studied, cefotaxime, moxifloxacin, telithromycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were the most active drugs. The most frequent serotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were 19F (25%), 19A (17%), 6B (12%), 14 (10%), and 23F (10%). Of the 125 strains, 109 (87.2%) showed the MLS(B) phenotype [103 had the erm(B) gene and 6 had both erm(B) and mef(E) genes]. Sixteen (12.8%) strains showed the M phenotype [14 with mef(E) and 2 with mef(A)]. All isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of the int, xis, tnpR, and tnpA genes associated with conjugative transposons (Tn916 family and Tn917). Positive detection of erm(B), tet(M), int, and xis genes related to the Tn916 family was found in 77.1% of MLS(B) phenotype strains. In 16 strains, only the tndX, erm(B), and tet(M) genes were detected, suggesting the presence of Tn1116, a transposon recently described for Streptococcus pyogenes. Five clones, namely, Sweden(15A)-25, clone(19F) ST87, Spain(23F)-1, Spain(6B)-2, and clone(19A) ST276, accounted for half of the MLS(B) strains. In conclusion, the majority of erythromycin-resistant pneumococci isolated in Spain had the MLS(B) phenotype, belonged to multiresistant international clones, and carried the erm(B), tet(M), xis, and int genes, suggesting the spread of transposons of the Tn916 family.
TI  - Transcriptome analyses extend understanding of Streptococcus pyogenes regulatory  mechanisms and behavior toward immunomodulatory substances.
AB  - The recent genome sequencing of several Streptococcus pyogenes serotype strains allowed the design of corresponding DNA microarrays and their usage for specific transcriptome analyses. In the present study, we employed transcriptomics together with functional tests to investigate the impact of the CiaH sensor gene of the CiaRH two-component regulator on gene expression and virulence traits of serotype M49 S. pyogenes strains CS101 and 591. In parallel, we studied the effects of the immunostimulatory substance Luivac on the serotype M49 S. pyogenes transcriptome and several biological features of serotype M1, M2, M3, M6, M18, and M49 S. pyogenes strains. Overall, the transcriptome analyses allowed a swift identification of differences in transcript abundance apparently associated with the observed strain-specific changes in matrix protein binding, eukaryotic cell interactions, or biofilm formation of the ciaH mutants and of wild-type strains exposed to a commercially available substance used for preventing upper respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Toxic shock syndrome: experience in a pediatric intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review patients with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in a pediatric intensive care unit. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with TSS admitted to the intensive care unit in the previous 15 years. The patients included were those that met the clinical and microbiological criteria for TSS proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: There were nine patients (four boys). The mean age was 7 years. The most frequent findings were fever (100 %), hypotension (100 %), erythroderma (100 %), multisystem organ failure [coagulopathy (100 %), lethargy (89 %), hypertransaminasemia (89 %), increased creatine phosphokinase levels (78 %), renal failure (66 %)] and cutaneous desquamation (100 %). Laboratory studies showed changes in the leukocyte count and C-reactive protein value in all patients. The etiology was as follows: Staphylococcus was detected in six patients (S. epidermidis in three and S. aureus in three) and Streptococcus was detected in two patients (S. pyogenes in one and S. pneumoniae in one); no microorganisms were detected in only one patient. The origin of the infection was identified in seven patients (cutaneous in six patients and tonsillar in one). All patients received life support and antibiotic treatment. Six patients received corticosteroid treatment and one received intravenous immunoglobulins. Patients with TSS secondary to Streptococcus showed the greatest severity, exhibiting renal failure and requiring greater respiratory and circulatory support. All patients recovered well from the infection, without serious long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION. TSS should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever, exanthema and shock, since early diagnosis has been shown to improve outcomes. S. pneumoniae should be included among the microorganisms that cause TSS. Treatment is based on life support measures and antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Thrombospondin-1 promotes cellular adherence of gram-positive pathogens via recognition of peptidoglycan.
AB  - Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular glycoprotein that has key roles in interactions between human cells and components of the extracellular matrix. Here we report a novel role for the lectin TSP1 in pathogen-host interactions. Binding assays and flow cytometric analysis demonstrate that Streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens including S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes interact specifically with human TSP1. We also show for the first time that host cell-bound TSP1 promotes adherence of gram-positive pathogens to human epithelial and endothelial cell lines. Pretreatment of bacteria with sodium periodate but not Pronase E substantially reduced TSP1-mediated bacterial adherence to host cells, suggesting that a glycoconjugate on the bacterial cell surface functions as the receptor for TSP1. Lipoteichoic acids did not affect TSP1-mediated adherence of S. pneumoniae to host cells. In contrast, attachment of S. pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens to host cells via TSP1 was blocked by soluble peptidoglycan, indicating recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan by TSP1. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that recognition of gram-positive pathogens by TSP1 promotes bacterial colonization of host tissue cells. In this scenario, peptidoglycan functions as adhesin and TSP1 acts as a molecular bridge linking gram-positive bacteria with receptors on the host cell.
TI  - Molecular and structural characterization of the PezAT chromosomal toxin-antitoxin system of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The chromosomal pezT gene of the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae  encodes a protein that is homologous to the zeta toxin of the Streptococcus pyogenes plasmid pSM19035-encoded epsilon-zeta toxin-antitoxin system. Overexpression of pezT in Escherichia coli led to severe growth inhibition from which the bacteria recovered approximately 3 h after induction of expression. The toxicity of PezT was counteracted by PezA, which is encoded immediately upstream of pezT and shares weak sequence similarities in the C-terminal region with the epsilon antitoxin. The pezAT genes form a bicistronic operon that is co-transcribed from a sigma(70)-like promoter upstream of pezA and is negatively autoregulated with PezA functioning as a transcriptional repressor and PezT as a co-repressor. Both PezA and the non-toxic PezA(2)PezT(2) protein complex bind to a palindrome sequence that overlaps the promoter. This differs from the epsilon-zeta system in which epsilon functions solely as the antitoxin and transcriptional regulation is carried out by another protein designated omega. Results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the toxicity of PezT is dependent on a highly conserved phosphoryltransferase active site and an ATP/GTP nucleotide binding site. In the PezA(2)PezT(2) complex, PezA neutralizes the toxicity of PezT by blocking the nucleotide binding site through steric hindrance.
TI  - New Tn916-related elements causing erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the as yet unexplored genetic elements encoding erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci. METHODS: Sixteen Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates sharing erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance and susceptibility to tetracycline were used. Gene detection was performed by PCR using both established and specially designed primers. S. pneumoniae R6, Streptococcus pyogenes 12RF and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 were used as recipients in mating experiments. RESULTS: Of the 16 test strains, 14 bore an unexpressed tet(M) gene which in 13 strains had a genetic linkage with erm(B). Three isolates yielded a 3.2 kb and 10 an 11.9 kb erm(B)/tet(M) amplicon. The former three showed genetic organizations similar to that of the composite element Tn3872, where the erm(B)-carrying Tn917 transposon is inserted into a Tn916-like element. Of the latter 10 isolates, 9 showed genetic organizations substantially overlapping with that of Tn6002, a newly sequenced erm(B)-containing Tn916-related transposon. The tenth isolate carried a novel composite element (designated Tn6003) resulting from the insertion into a Tn6002-like transposon of a fragment [designated macrolide-aminoglycoside-streptothricin (MAS) element] containing a second erm(B) (lacking the stop codon) and a variant of the aadE-sat4-aphA-3 cluster. The two tet(M)-negative isolates had different Tn3872-related elements, one containing a complete and one a deleted MAS fragment. Conjugative transfer was obtained from donors carrying Tn6002-related elements, not from donors carrying Tn3872-related elements. CONCLUSIONS: In tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci with erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance, the erm(B) gene is carried on a variety of Tn916-related genetic elements either lacking tet(M) or, more often, carrying an unexpressed tet(M) gene.
TI  - Albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. Albomycin was found to be active against bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. We examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that Enterobacteriaceae except species of Proteus and Morganella were sensitive. Resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. The in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Yersinia enterocolitica. A single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of Y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. A single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear S. pneumoniae infections in mice. In direct competition experiments with wild-type S. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. We conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a mouse model. Albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. The ferrichrome transport system serves as a Trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of antimicrobial and bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects of macrolides antibiotics against clinical isolates, and examination of shape alteration by scanning electron microscope].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides (MLs), erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 4 bacterial species of clinical strains isolated in 2004. Bacterial isolates used were 51 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 20 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 68 of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 120 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrolide resistance genes, ermB and mefE, in macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, and all of pneumococci were analyzed by PCR. Antimicrobial activities against macrolide-susceptible MSSA of EM and CAM, were more potent than those of RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than EM, CAM and AZM. Against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, 4 antibiotics showed similar antimicrobial activities. Twelve, 1 and 2 strains of MSSA, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to EM, CAM and AZM, whereas RKM was active to almost, but not quite, of them. Among 120 strains of S. pneumoniae, 76 (63.3%) were resistant to EM (MIC; > or = 0.5 microg/mL), and 23, 15 and 28 strains were highly resistant (MIC; > 128 microg/mL) to EM, CAM and AZM, respectively. By contrast, for RKM, there were far fewer resistant strains, and there was no highly resistant strain. PCR analyses of macrolide-resistant genes revealed that 1 resistant strain of S. pyogenes and 2 of S. agalactiae carried mefE and ermB, respectively. In the case of S. pneumoniae, 59, 19 and 5 strains, respectively, carried ermB, mefE and both ermB and mefe. We also studied about bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAE) of MLs using macrolide-susceptible, and ermB- and mefE-carrying S. pneumoniae, and observed morphological alterations of the strains treated with the drugs by a scanning electron microscope. It was demonstrated that RKM had superior bactericidal activities and PAE than other 3 drugs, and potent destructive effects to all of 3 strains.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates from primary care clinics to oral antibacterial agents].
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates from specimens of patients  in primary care clinics in 2005 was investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations of oral antibacterial agents. The numbers of test strains were 550 for Gram-positive aerobes, 700 for Gram-negative aerobes, and 150 for anaerobes. Cefcapene (CFPN), cefditoren (CDTR), and cefteram (CFTM) showed the most potent activities against Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. among the cephems tested and moxifloxacin (MFLX) and tosufloxacin among the new quinolones. Although the new quinolones generally showed potent activities against these species, resistant strains were frequently detected in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, 70% or more of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were intermediate or resistant to macrolides. Cephems showed good activities against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria except for Proteus spp. Specifically, CFPN, CDTR, and CFTM showed the most potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae among the cephems tested. The new quinolones showed potent activities against Gram-negative bacteria, especially H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but not against Proteus mirabilis and Providencia spp. When compared with the susceptibilities of clinical isolates from tertiary care hospitals, found in other research, differences were noted, for example, there was a lower frequency of quinolone-resistant strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus but a higher frequency of macrolide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Therefore, to accurately grasp susceptibility trends, well-focused surveillance studies are necessary.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of respiratory isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Streptococcus pyogenes to telithromycin and 11 other antimicrobial agents: Turkish results of e-BASKETT-II surveillance study].
AB  - In respiratory tract infections, therapy is often empirical and there is a need for local data on the rate of resistance to available antimicrobials. In this multicentre study which is a part of the international e-BASKETT-II surveillance study, respiratory isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=260) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=312) collected between September 2002 and June 2003 from 18 hospitals in Turkey were tested against penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, clindamycin, telithromycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin and vancomycin. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined with disk diffusion method and confirmed with broth dilution method following the CLSI guidelines. Isolates which were resistant to erythromycin were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. In S. pneumoniae 11.5% of the isolates were highly and 22.7% were intermediately resistant to penicillin. Rate of resistance to erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin was 17.3%, and 21.5% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Resistance to levofloxacin and vancomycin was not observed and only one isolate was found intermediately resistant (MIC=2 microg/mL) to telithromycin. Genotypes in erythromycin-resistant isolates were ermB (77.8%), mefA (17.8%) and ermB+mefA (2.2%). S. pyogenes isolates were uniformly susceptible to beta-lactams and vancomycin, and only one isolate was intermediately resistant to levofloxacin. Macrolide resistance was observed in 1.3% of the isolates and three out of these harboured the mefA gene. One isolate with an MIC of 4 microg/mL for telithromycin had ermB gene. Telithromycin has demonstrated a good in vitro activity against macrolide-resistant respiratory tract isolates. As a result, e-BASKETT-II surveillance study has been one of the most extensive in vitro studies comparing telithromycin to available antimicrobial agents for respiratory tract infections in Turkey.
TI  - Activities of 16-membered ring macrolides and telithromycin against different genotypes of erythromycin-susceptible and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test four 16-membered macrolides (josamycin, spiramycin, midecamycin and rokitamycin) along with other compounds in the same class (erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin and azithromycin) plus clindamycin and telithromycin, against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with well-characterized resistance genotypes. METHODS: Four hundred and eighty-six isolates of S. pyogenes and 375 isolates of S. pneumoniae were assayed for their macrolide susceptibilities and investigated by PCR to detect their different erythromycin resistance genes. All strains had been isolated over the period 2002-2003 from specimens of different human origin obtained in 14 different Italian centres. RESULTS: All 16-membered macrolides showed very low MICs (MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s, < or =0.06-0.5 mg/L) for the erythromycin-susceptible isolates and for those with the M phenotype, but the telithromycin MICs for the M-type isolates were at least four times higher (MIC(90)s, 0.5 mg/L). In S. pyogenes, the MIC(50)s of 16-membered macrolides for the cMLS(B) isolates were > or = 256 mg/L, whereas that for telithromycin was 4 mg/L; the MIC(50)s of 16-membered macrolides and telithromycin ranged from < or = 0.06 to 0.5 mg/L for the iMLS(B) isolates with erm(A) and from 0.12 to > or = 256 mg/L for those with erm(B). In S. pneumoniae, the MIC(50)s of the 16-membered macrolides for the cMLS(B) isolates ranged from 0.5 to 128 mg/L, whereas for the iMLS(B) isolates their values ranged from < or = 0.06 to 4 mg/L; the MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s of telithromycin for both the cMLS(B) and the iMLS(B) isolates ranged from < or = 0.06 to 0.12 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: MICs ranged for all the drugs, except telithromycin, from < or = 0.06 to > or = 256 mg/L, with 15% to 30% resistant S. pyogenes for all drugs tested except clindamycin (8%) and telithromycin (5.4%) and 10% to 40% resistant S. pneumoniae for all drugs tested except telithromycin (0.3%). In both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, erythromycin resistance related to a mef gene meant that telithromycin MICs were definitely higher than in erythromycin-susceptible isolates, although telithromycin susceptibility was preserved in all cases. In S. pyogenes, the activity of both 16-membered macrolides and telithromycin against the iMLS(B) strains proved to be dependent on the erm gene involved, being greater against isolates with erm(A).
TI  - Reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  - Intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. However, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (DPR), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (ADPR) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the DPR l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines NNC 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and NNC 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity relationship. These compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. Moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. This may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. The results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. Combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.
TI  - Activity of faropenem against middle ear fluid pathogens from children with acute otitis media in Costa Rica and Israel.
AB  - Faropenem was tested against 1,188 middle ear fluid pathogens from children in Israel and Costa Rica. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, faropenem was the most active beta-lactam, with activity that was similar to or greater than of the other oral antimicrobial classes studied. Faropenem was also active against Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Usefulness of immunohistochemical diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens compared with culture and gram stain techniques.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent cause of pneumonia and meningitis.  Because S pneumoniae can colonize the upper respiratory tract and antibiotic treatment may inhibit growth, culture-based diagnosis can be problematic. An immunohistochemical assay using a polyclonal antibody against pneumococci was used to test formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 46 patients for whom bacterial culture results were available. Samples from 26 patients demonstrated pneumococcal antigens in areas of pneumonia, meningitis, or osteomyelitis or within circulating inflammatory cells. Various specimens from 18 patients grew S pneumoniae, whereas 8 had cultures that grew mixed bacteria or had no growth but were polymerase chain reaction-positive for the S pneumoniae Ity A gene. Pneumococcal antigens were not present in 20 cases (7 grew Streptococcus pyogenes; 9, Staphylococcus aureus; and 4, Haemophilus influenzae). Compared with culture, the immunohistochemical assay showed 100% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Immunohistochemical analysis has the diagnostic advantage of correlating host inflammatory reaction with presence of pneumococci.
TI  - Resistance patterns of selected respiratory tract pathogens in Poland.
AB  - This study presents the results of a survey of the in-vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of major pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Poland during 2002-2004. The collection of 1184 bacterial isolates comprised 398 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 344 Haemophilus influenzae, 302 Streptococcus pyogenes and 140 Moraxella catarrhalis. Among the pneumococcal isolates, 16.8% were penicillin-non-susceptible (PNSP), of which 80.6% were identified as multidrug-resistant. Overall, 9.0% of H. influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase-positive, although this percentage increased noticeably in the third year of the study. Based on PCR results, 12.8% of H. influenzae isolates were identified as low-level beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR), and one isolate as low-level beta-lactamase-positive, amoxycillin-clavulanic acid-resistant (BLPACR). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) classified 45 H. influenzae isolates with altered penicillin-binding proteins into 15 PFGE types, including two predominant types (with four and six sub-types) containing 15 and ten isolates, respectively. Resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin was found in 20.9%, 8.9% and 4.6% of S. pyogenes isolates, respectively. The production of beta-lactamase characterised 91.4% of M. catarrhalis isolates. In summary, the overall occurrence of PNSP in Poland remains stable, although there was a noticeable increase in the proportion of fully-resistant isolates. A rising trend in the prevalence of beta-lactamase producers and low-level BLNAR isolates was observed among Polish isolates of H. influenzae.
TI  - Pili mediate specific adhesion of Streptococcus pyogenes to human tonsil and skin.
AB  - Very little is known about the biological functions of pili that have recently been found to be expressed by important Gram-positive pathogens such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus agalacticae, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Using various ex vivo tissue and cellular models, here we show that pili mediate adhesion of serotype M1 S. pyogenes strain SF370 to both human tonsil epithelium and primary human keratinocytes, which represent the two main sites of infection by this human-specific pathogen. Mutants lacking minor pilus subunits retained the ability to express cell-surface pili, but these were functionally defective. In contrast to above, pili were not required for S. pyogenes adhesion to either immortalized HEp-2 or A549 cells, highlighting an important limitation of these extensively used adhesion/invasion models. Adhering bacteria were internalized very effectively by both HEp-2 and A549 cells, but not by tonsil epithelium or primary keratinocytes. While pili acted as the primary adhesin, the surface M1 protein clearly enhanced adhesion to tonsil, but surprisingly, had the opposite effect on adhesion to keratinocytes. These studies provide clear evidence that S. pyogenes pili display an adhesive specificity for clinically relevant human tissues and are likely to play a critical role in the initial stages of infection.
TI  - A rare case of postinfectious glomerulonephritis caused by pneumococcus in an adult patient.
AB  - Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is commonly seen as a complication of infection with nephritogenic strains of group A streptococci, mostly with Streptococcus pyogenes. Pneumococcal pneumonia leading to glomerulonephritis has been reported in the pediatric literature, but only one adult case has been previously reported. We are presenting a case of postinfectious glomerulonephritis caused by pneumococcal pneumonia in an adult. In the present case, other possible etiologies of nephritic syndrome were ruled out with negative antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (Anti-GBM), antistreptolysin O (ASO), antinuclear antibody (ANA), HIV and viral hepatitis profile. The low CH50 indicated a complement-mediated injury. Renal biopsy was done showing immune complex-mediated crescentic glomerulonephritis consistent with postinfectious etiology. The patient received pulse dose steroids for 5 days followed by oral steroids. His urinary output improved along with normalization of his renal function, therefore dialysis was discontinued. We are presenting this case to alert clinicians to the possibility of postinfectious glomerulonephritis following pneumococcal pneumonia and to report the successful use of steroid therapy in such a situation.
TI  - [In-vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 18,639 clinical isolates obtained from 77 centers in 2004].
AB  - A total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in Japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other selected antibiotics. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against FQs. The isolation rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to FQs. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli against FQs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. The FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was around 5%. The FQs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), however, it was lower than that of MRSA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from UTI and 15-19% of from RTI was resistant to FQs. Acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Although FQs-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in Japan. In this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to FQs.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils was evaluated on Vero cells. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens. The antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was examined. Some oils showed inhibition of bacterial growth against most of the organisms examined. Cinnamon and thyme showed the strongest action followed by clove. The results reported in this paper indicate that thyme can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of some respiratory tract infections in man.
TI  - Effect of smoking cessation on the microbial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of smoking cessation on the frequency of recovery of potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic interfering bacteria in the nasopharynges of smokers. DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal cultures were taken from 20 smokers before and 12 to 15 months after cessation of smoking. Potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. RESULTS: Eleven potential pathogens (0.92 pathogens per subject) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 9 individuals before smoking cessation, and 2 (0.17 per subject) were recovered from 2 individuals after smoking cessation (P < .05). Bacterial interference between 2 aerobic (alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci) and 2 anaerobic species (Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species) and 4 potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. Bacterial interference was noted in 35 instances against the 4 potential pathogens by 14 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the smokers before cessation and in 116 instances by 42 isolates after cessation (P < .01). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, these findings illustrate for the first time that the high number of pathogens and low number of interfering organisms found in the nasopharynx of smokers revert to normal levels after complete cessation of smoking.
TI  - In vitro activities of oral cephem and telithromycin against clinical isolates of major respiratory pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of oral cephem antibiotics and ketolide telithromycin against major respiratory pathogens possessing beta-lactam-resistant mutations (within the pbp gene) and/or macrolide-resistant genes (erm and mef) were examined in clinical isolates collected at 66 institutes in all over the Japan between 2002 and 2003. Telithromycin showed the strongest antibacterial activity against methicillinsusceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains with and without macrolide-resistant genes, such as ermA or ermC gene. All the cephem antibiotics showed potent antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.015 mg/L or lower. Cefdinir had a much higher MIC90 against genotypic penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (gPRSP) than cefditoren and cefcapene (8 mg/L cefdinir vs. 1 mg/L cefditoren and cefcapene). The majority of gPRSP harbored either ermB or mefA, and the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against these strains was decreased however some susceptibility was still sustained. Cefditoren exerted the strongest antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 0.5 mg/L. These results underline the importance of checking the susceptibility and selecting an appropriate antibiotic against target pathogens.
TI  - [Biological activity tests of chemical constituents from two Brazilian Labiatae plants].
AB  - We studied the bioactivities of constituents from two tropical medicinal plants,  Cunila spicata and Hyptis fasciculata. These plants found in Brazil belong to the Labiatae family. Four known compounds obtained from these herbs were identified as 3alpha, 24-dihydoxylurs-12-en-28-oic acid, betulinic acid, aurantiamide acetate, and aurantiamide benzoate by spectroscopic means. 3alpha, 24-Dihydoxylurs-12-en-28-oic acid has potent inhibitory activity against Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Porphyromomas gingivalis. Aurantiamide benzoate exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase. It was clarified that herbs Cunila spicata and Hyptis fasciculata are effective against bronchitis and gout.
TI  - Frequency of recovery of pathogens from the nasopharynx of children with acute maxillary sinusitis before and after the introduction of vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the proportion of recovery of pathogens in the nasopharynx  of children with acute maxillary sinusitis in the 5 years period before to the 5 years period following the introduction of vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). METHODS: Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained from 428 children with acute maxillary sinusitis, 208 between 1996 and 2000, and 220 between 2001 and 2005. The PCV7 was administered to 174 (79%) of the 220 children seen between 2001 and 2005. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty eight potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from 208 children between 1996 and 2000. Organisms were isolated in 114 patients (55%). The predominant organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (59 or 43% of all isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (46 or 33%), Moraxella catarrhalis (18 or 13%), Streptococcus pyogenes (9 or 7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6 or 4%). One hundred and sixty five potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from 220 patients between 2001 and 2005. Organisms were isolated in 121 patients (55%). The predominant organisms were H. influenzae non-type b (68 or 41% of all isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (41 or 25%), M. catarrhalis (23 or 14%), Streptococcus pyogenes (20 or 12%), and Staphylococcus aureus (13 or 8%). Significant statistical differences were noted in the rates of recovery of Streptococcus pneumoniae (p<0.05). A decrease occurred in the recovery of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin from 44% between 1997 and 2000 to 27% between 2000 and 2005. An increase was noted in the isolation of beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae from 37% between 1997 and 2000 to 44%. However, neither of these changes was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This data illustrates that a significant shift occurred in the causative pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in children in the 5 years after the introduction of vaccination of children with the PCV7 as compared to the previous 5 years. While the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 18%, the proportion of H. influenzae increased by 8%.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of PD 0305970 and PD 0326448, new bacterial gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitors with potent antibacterial activities versus multidrug-resistant gram-positive and fastidious organism groups.
AB  - PD 0305970 and PD 0326448 are new bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase inhibitors (quinazoline-2,4-diones) that possess outstanding in vitro and in vivo activities against a wide spectrum of bacterial species including quinolone- and multidrug-resistant gram-positive and fastidious organism groups. The respective MICs (microg/ml) for PD 0305970 capable of inhibiting>or=90% of bacterial strains tested ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 versus staphylococci, 0.03 to 0.06 versus streptococci, 0.25 to 2 versus enterococci, and 0.25 to 0.5 versus Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, and Neisseria spp. PD 0326448 MIC90s were generally twofold higher versus these same organism groups. Comparative quinolone MIC90 values were 4- to 512-fold higher than those of PD 0305970. In testing for frequency of resistance, PD 0305970 and levofloxacin showed low levels of development of spontaneous resistant mutants versus both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Unlike quinolones, which target primarily gyrA and parC, analysis of resistant mutants in S. pneumoniae indicates that the likely targets of PD 0305970 are gyrB and parE. PD 0305970 demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity by in vitro time-kill testing versus streptococci. This bactericidal activity carried over to in vivo testing, where PD 0305970 and PD 0326448 displayed outstanding Streptococcus pyogenes 50% protective doses (PD50s) (oral dosing) of 0.7 and 3.6 mg/kg, respectively (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin PD50s were>100 and 17.7 mg/kg, respectively). PD 0305970 was also potent in a pneumococcal pneumonia mouse infection model (PD50=3.2 mg/kg) and was 22-fold more potent than levofloxacin.
TI  - Detecting key structural features within highly recombined genes.
AB  - Many microorganisms exhibit high levels of intragenic recombination following horizontal gene transfer events. Furthermore, many microbial genes are subject to strong diversifying selection as part of the pathogenic process. A multiple sequence alignment is an essential starting point for many of the tools that provide fundamental insights on gene structure and evolution, such as phylogenetics; however, an accurate alignment is not always possible to attain. In this study, a new analytic approach was developed in order to better quantify the genetic organization of highly diversified genes whose alleles do not align. This BLAST-based method, denoted BLAST Miner, employs an iterative process that places short segments of highly similar sequence into discrete datasets that are designated "modules." The relative positions of modules along the length of the genes, and their frequency of occurrence, are used to identify sequence duplications, insertions, and rearrangements. Partial alleles of sof from Streptococcus pyogenes, encoding a surface protein under host immune selection, were analyzed for module content. High-frequency Modules 6 and 13 were identified and examined in depth. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to both modules contain numerous duplications and inverted repeats, whereby many codons form palindromic pairs. Combined with evidence for a strong codon usage bias, data suggest that Module 6 and 13 sequences are under selection to preserve their nucleic acid secondary structure. The concentration of overlapping tandem and inverted repeats within a small region of DNA is highly suggestive of a mechanistic role for Module 6 and 13 sequences in promoting aberrant recombination. Analysis of pbp2X alleles from Streptococcus pneumoniae, encoding cell wall enzymes that confer antibiotic resistance, supports the broad applicability of this tool in deciphering the genetic organization of highly recombined genes. BLAST Miner shares with phylogenetics the important predictive quality that leads to the generation of testable hypotheses based on sequence data.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the sil locus by the SilCR signalling peptide and its implications on group A streptococcus virulence.
AB  - In the last two decades an increasing number of local outbreaks of invasive group A streptococcus (GAS) infections including necrotizing fasciitis (NF) have been reported. We identified the streptococcal invasion locus (sil) which is essential for virulence of the M14 strain JS95 isolated from an NF patient. This locus contains six genes: silA/B and silD/E encoding two-component system (TCS) and ABC transporter, respectively, homologous to the corresponding entities in the regulon of Streptococcus pneumoniae involved in genetic competence. Situated between these two units are silC and silCR, which highly overlap and are transcribed from the complementing strand at opposite directions. SilCR is a putative competence stimulating peptide, but in the M14 strain it has a start codon mutation. Deletion of silC or addition of synthetic SilCR attenuates virulence of the M14 strain. Here we found that silC and silCR form a novel regulatory circuit that controls the sil locus transcription. Under non-inducing conditions silC represses the silCR promoter. Externally added SilCR peptide activates the TCS, which in turn stimulates silCR transcription. Ongoing silCR transcription mediates the repression of the converging and overlapping silC transcript. Transcription of bacteriocin-like peptide (blp) operon mirrors the inverse relationships between the silC and silCR transcripts. It is upregulated by either addition of SilCR or deletion of silC. Moreover, expression of silC from a plasmid in a silC deleted-mutant significantly represses blp transcription. Finally, we show that 18% of clinically relevant GAS isolates possess sil and produce SilCR. Based on these results we propose a working model for regulation gene expression and virulence in GAS by the SilCR signalling peptide.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis caused by group a streptococcus.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is a rare disease that is most often caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and anaerobic bacteria. We present an unusual case of purulent pericarditis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococcus (GAS), and we provide a review of the literature.
TI  - Identification and structural basis of binding to host lung glycogen by streptococcal virulence factors.
AB  - The ability of pathogenic bacteria to recognize host glycans is often essential to their virulence. Here we report structure-function studies of previously uncharacterized glycogen-binding modules in the surface-anchored pullulanases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpuA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (PulA). Multivalent binding to glycogen leads to a strong interaction with alveolar type II cells in mouse lung tissue. X-ray crystal structures of the binding modules reveal a novel fusion of tandem modules into single, bivalent functional domains. In addition to indicating a structural basis for multivalent attachment, the structure of the SpuA modules in complex with carbohydrate provides insight into the molecular basis for glycogen specificity. This report provides the first evidence that intracellular lung glycogen may be a novel target of pathogenic streptococci and thus provides a rationale for the identification of the streptococcal alpha-glucan-metabolizing machinery as virulence factors.
TI  - Management of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis in children.
AB  - Acute pharyngotonsillitis is one of the most common infections encountered by pediatricians and family physicians. According to the US Vital Health Statistics report, acute pharyngotonsillitis is responsible for more than 6 million office visits each year by children younger than 15 years of age and an additional 1.8 million visits by adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years. Most children with acute pharyngotonsillitis have symptoms that can be attributed to infection with a respiratory virus, such as adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. However, in approximately 30% to 40% of cases, acute pharyngotonsillitis is of bacterial etiology. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) are responsible for most bacterial cases of acute pharyngotonsillitis, although other pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, may be the causative agents in sporadic cases. Pharyngotonsillitis caused by these latter pathogens can sometimes be distinguished from that caused by GABHS by considering the patient's medical history in concert with the clinical presentation. In some cases, acute pharyngotonsillitis may have an idiopathic etiology. An accurate diagnosis of GABHS infection is important because it is the only common form of acute pharyngotonsillitis for which antibiotic therapy is definitely indicated. Antibiotic therapy can shorten the clinical course of GABHS pharyngotonsillitis, reduce the rate of transmission, and prevent suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, such as peritonsillar abscess and acute rheumatic fever. Although the threat of rheumatic fever is much lower for children in the United States than in developing nations, preventing rheumatic fever and the spread of disease is the primary goal of antibiotic therapy in GABHS pharyngotonsillitis treatment and a cornerstone of practice guidelines.
TI  - Outpatient antibiotic therapy as a predisposing factor for bacterial resistance:  a rational approach to airway infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present evidence-based recommendations for the use of antibiotics  for the treatment of the most common acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the available information on the importance of this type of management. SOURCES: MEDLINE and LILACS databases, technical publications by international organizations, national and international directives. The search terms acute respiratory infection, otitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, pneumonia, antibiotic, guidelines and bacterial resistance were used. Articles cited by the articles selected were analyzed for information of interest. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Bacterial resistance has grown, to the extent that today it is recognized as a global public health problem. ARI are the most common cause of antibiotic usage within the community; yet a large proportion of these cases, compromising the upper (otitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis) or the lower airways (pneumonia), are the result of viral infections. Recommendations to rationalize the use of antibiotics in patients with ARI have the common objective of minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use, since "antibiotic pressure" is one of the factors triggering bacterial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: It is of great importance to differentiate among ARI patients those who will benefit from the use of antibiotics. The establishment of recommendations for the prescription of antibiotics is one strategy for minimizing the frequency of bacterial resistance.
TI  - An open-label, double tympanocentesis study of levofloxacin therapy in children with, or at high risk for, recurrent or persistent acute otitis media.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Levofloxacin has excellent activity against common respiratory pathogens and therefore is likely to be effective in treating children with persistent or recurrent otitis media. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin treatment in the eradication of bacterial pathogens from the middle ear fluid (MEF) of children with, or at high risk for, persistent or recurrent otitis media. METHODS: An open-label multicenter trial was conducted that involved tympanocentesis at entry and selectively 3 to 5 days after starting levofloxacin (10 mg/kg twice a day for 10 days). RESULTS: : Two hundred five children (80% < or =2 years) were enrolled. One child did not have a confirmed diagnosis of acute otitis media and did not return for follow-up visits. Of the remaining 204 children, 94 (46%) had bilateral infection and 63 (31%) were receiving antimicrobials immediately before entry. One hundred five isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus. pyogenes were recovered in pure or mixed cultures. All isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. During-treatment bacterial eradication from MEF occurred in 88% (78 of 89) of bacteriologically evaluable patients, including 90% (65 of 72) of children < or =24 months of age. Bacteria initially isolated from MEF were eradicated in 31 of 37 (84%) children infected with S. pneumoniae and in 54 of 54 (100%) children infected with H. influenzae. Overall, clinical success rate after therapy was 94% for the total study population and 92% for the bacteriologically evaluable population. Levofloxacin was well tolerated. Vomiting (4%) was the most common treatment-limiting adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin was safe and effective in treating and eradicating common bacterial pathogens from MEF in children with, or at risk for, recurrent or persistent otitis media.
TI  - Efficacy of N-acetyl-cysteine in combination with thiamphenicol in sequential (intramuscular/aerosol) therapy of upper respiratory tract infections even when sustained by bacterial biofilms.
AB  - A total of 102 patients with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections underwent microbiological exploration with appropriate sampling and direct biopsies of the infected sites. Therapy was then started and on day 1 each patient received two intramuscular injections of thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate (TGA). From day 2 to 10 sequential therapy with the same drug was continued employing TGA administered by aerosol. All putative etiologic agents recovered were susceptible to thiamphenicol and only 24 demonstrated the ability to produce in vitro biofilms. The organisms comprised 10 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 3 Haemophilus influenzae. Of the 24 subjects in whom biofilms were demonstrated to be present in vivo by Scanning Electron Microscopy, clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained in 21 cases (87.5%) following sequential therapy with TGA. Failures were considered to be persistent signs and symptoms at day 15 after initiation of treatment and lack of eradication of 3 S. aureus strains, despite their in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol. Very few adverse events attributable to TGA were reported in this cohort of patients. In no case was discontinuation of treatment deemed necessary by the attending physician.
TI  - Macrolide resistance rates in respiratory pathogens in Slovenia following reduced macrolide use.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the association between decreased use of macrolides and resistance of common respiratory pathogens in Slovenia from 1999 to 2004. Over a 6-year period the consumption of macrolides in Slovenia decreased by 21.3%, from 3.81 defined daily doses/1000 inhabitants per day (DID) to 3.0 DID. The use of short-acting, intermediate-acting and long-acting subclasses of macrolides decreased by 50%, 18% and 13%, respectively. In the same period, resistance of invasive strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 4.6% to 11.1% and resistance of non-invasive strains of S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes increased from 12.8% to 20.2% and from 7.4% to 12.5%, respectively. Resistance increased significantly more in children than in adults (P=0.05) and was significantly correlated with increased use of intermediate-acting macrolides (r=0.94 for non-invasive S. pneumoniae and r=0.96 for S. pyogenes) in children. Resistance of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was low and did not change. In children and adults, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains of invasive S. pneumoniae was observed. The decline in total macrolide use was not paralleled by reduced macrolide resistance rates of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae during the 6-year period. There was a strong correlation between the use of intermediate-acting macrolides and macrolide resistance of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae in children. Further reduction in the use of intermediate- and long-acting macrolides should be encouraged.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Isolation and identification of the icosalides--cyclic peptolides with selective  antibiotic and cytotoxic activities.
AB  - Three cyclic peptolides have been isolated from two different fungal species and  their structures determined. Icosalides A1 (1a), A2 (1b), and B (1c) each contain two serine and two leucine amino acid residues and incorporate two fatty acid moieties as part of the central twenty-member ring. 1a contains L-serine and both D- and L-leucine residues, while 1b and 1c contain only L-amino acid residues. Icosalide A1 displays antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae (Felton), and Enterococcus faecalis. Icosalides A2 and B are cytotoxic to replicating MDCK cells.
TI  - A Comparison of group A Streptococcus versus Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: St reptococcus pyogenes is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children. Further, its clinical course in comparison to pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia has not been previously highlighted. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of children 0-18 years of age from April 1983 to April 2005, with discharge diagnoses of invasive disease caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes), or Streptococcus pneumonia (SP) or pneumonia. Data were extracted from the charts, and a comparison of clinical characteristics between the 2 etiologies was performed. Confirmed disease required blood or pleural fluid isolates. Patients with single isolates of GAS in tracheobronchial secretions or sputum were classified as having presumed disease caused by GAS. Patients with confirmed disease due to GAS and SP were compared with respect to clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of 103 patients with invasive GAS disease, 12 (11.6%) had confirmed GAS lobar pneumonia. In addition 7 patients had presumed GAS pneumonia. There were 54 patients with confirmed SP pneumonia. Most children who had GAS pneumonia were healthy and recovered completely. Compared with patients with confirmed SP pneumonia, those with confirmed GAS pneumonia had more frequent and larger effusions, more culture positive effusions, had prolonged fever, and had longer hospitalizations. There was not an increasing trend to GAS pneumonia over the 22-year period. There was not a predominant serotype responsible for the pneumonias. CONCLUSIONS: Lobar GAS pneumonia represents approximately 11% of all cases of invasive disease in this institution during a 22-year period. Compared with patients with SP pneumonia, it appears to cause more effusions and morbidity. The organism is also more frequently recovered from pleural fluid.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae: surveillance from 1993 to 2004 in Central Italy.
AB  - The susceptibility of 1870 Streptococcus pyogenes and 1595 Streptococcus pneumoniae to macrolides and lincosamides has been monitored from 1993 to 2004 in Central Italy. Among S. pyogenes, 30.2% were erythromycin resistant; 18.5% were also resistant to josamycin and clindamycin (MLS phenotype). After an increasing erythromycin resistance rate in 1993-1997 (maximum 53.16%), a definite decrease was observed since 2001 with resistance rates always less than 30%. Thirty six percent of pneumococcal isolates were erythromycin-resistant, with minor temporal fluctuations; the MLS phenotype was the most prevalent overall (32.6%) and in individual years. S. pneumoniae strains were also tested for susceptibility to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial agents: 11.2% were penicillin non-susceptible, with a gradually increasing prevalence after 2001 (maximum rate 17.3% in 2004), 31.15% were resistant to tetracycline, 4.9% to chloramphenicol, 0.74% to rifampin. All pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin and 99.9% to ceftriaxone and ofloxacin.
TI  - Nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria in medical students: effects of clinic exposure on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. One important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of S. aureus among hospital personnel. There are only a few studies investigating the carriage of S. aureus in a community of medical students. Oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. Oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of S. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. Methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Azithromycin-sulfonamide conjugates as inhibitors of resistant Streptococcus pyogenes strains.
AB  - Novel hybrid compounds 6a-6d, conjugates of 15-membered azalides and sulfonamides, i.e. unsubstituted, 4-aryl- and 4-heteroaryl-aminosulfonyl derivatives of 9a-[N'-(phenylcarbamoyl)]-9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A were synthesized and characterized by IR, one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopies and MALDI-TOF and MS/MS mass spectrometry. The new compounds were evaluated in vitro against a panel of sensitive and resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. 9a-{N'-[4-(Aminosulfonyl)phenyl]carbamoyl}--(6a) and 9a-{N'-[4-(phenylaminosulfonyl)phenyl]carbamoyl}--(6b) derivatives showed improvements in activity against inducible resistant Streptococcus pyogenes in comparison with macrolide antibiotic azithromycin and starting material 9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A (2). In addition, the synthesized azithromycin-sulfonamide conjugates 6a-6d showed good antibacterial activity against sensitive S. pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. The kinetics of degradation in the artificial gastric juice showed that the most active compounds, 6a and 6b, exhibited azithromycin like stability. The cleavage of the cladinose sugar was found to be the main decomposition pathway leading to inactive 7a and 7b, prepared also as analytical standards by the alternative synthetic route together with 7c and 7d.
TI  - Gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  - Bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a predominant force in bacterial evolution. To better understand the significance of LGT, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal genomes using a maximum likelihood method. This study indicates that the rate of gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each species. We have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by LGT and conclude that at least a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.
TI  - Sigma X induces competence gene expression in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Although not thought to become competent for DNA uptake, the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes appears to encode within its genome the DNA uptake and recombination machinery required for competence. The promoters of these genes contain a conserved sequence, CIN-box, which is recognized by the S. pyogenes alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor X. Using microarray technology, we found that sigma X induced the expression of competence genes in S. pyogenes. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm that the expression of these transcripts was induced 2-265-fold by sigma X. Of the eight CIN-box loci induced, femB, the ortholog a virulence factor in Staphylococcus aureus, was shown to be transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase containing sigma X, indicating that sigma X directly activates expression of this CIN-box gene. Sigma X-dependent induction of genes encoding competence machinery in S. pyogenes raises the possibility that some strains of this human pathogen can develop competence for genetic transformation.
TI  - DNA methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  - Recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (Tn1207.3 and Phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]). The dissemination of elements belonging to the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of GAS, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae recovered in Portugal was surveyed. In total, 149 GAS, 18 S. pneumoniae, 4 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 S. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the M phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 by PCR targeting open reading frames (ORFs) specific for these related elements. All the GAS isolates tested and one of the S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried Tn1207.3. However, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. It was also noted that the DNAs of the isolates carrying Tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease SmaI. Cloning and expression of ORF12 of Tn1207.3 in Escherichia coli showed that it encoded a methyltransferase that rendered DNA refractory to cleavage by SmaI (M.Spy10394I). Using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible GAS isolates presenting the M phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.
TI  - As a bacterial culture medium, citrated sheep blood agar is a practical alternative to citrated human blood agar in laboratories of developing countries.
AB  - Human blood agar (HuBA) is widely used in developing countries for the isolation  of bacteria from clinical specimens. This study compared citrated sheep blood agar (CSBA) and HuBA with defibrinated horse blood agar and defibrinated sheep blood agar (DSBA) for the isolation and antibiotic susceptibility testing of reference and clinical strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Reference and clinical strains of all organisms were diluted in brain heart infusion and a clinical specimen of cerebrospinal fluid and cultured on all agars. Viable counts, colony morphology, and colony size were recorded. Susceptibility testing for S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes was performed on defibrinated sheep blood Mueller-Hinton agar, citrated sheep blood Mueller-Hinton agar (CSB MHA), and human blood Mueller-Hinton agar plates. For all organisms, the colony numbers were similar on all agars. Substantially smaller colony sizes and absent or minimal hemolysis were noted on HuBA for all organisms. Antibiotic susceptibility results for S. pneumoniae were similar for the two sheep blood agars; however, larger zone sizes were displayed on HuBA, and quality control for the reference strain failed on HuBA. For S. pyogenes, larger zone sizes were demonstrated on HuBA and CSBA than on DSBA. Poor hemolysis made interpretation of the zone sizes difficult on HuBA. CSBA is an acceptable alternative for the isolation of these organisms. The characteristic morphology is not evident, and hemolysis is poor on HuBA; and so HuBA is not recommended for use for the isolation or the susceptibility testing of any of these organisms. CSB MHA may be suitable for use for the susceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in nasopharynx of healthy children attending a day care center in Havana City].
AB  - During the first six-month period of 2001, a descriptive cross-sectional study of carriage in healthy children attending a day-care center in Havana City was performed. The objective was to find out the prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and its association with possible risk factors. The design took into account the international and domestic regulatory bioethical requirements. Swabs of posterior nasopharynx of 160 children were directly cultured in brain heart agar plus sheep blood and in brain heart agar plus NAD, hemine and bacitracin and incubated for 18-24 h. Resulting isolates were identified using conventional techniques and the API NH system. Male children aged 3-4 years were predominant. A high percentage of nasopharyngeal carriage was detected; Haemophilus was isolated in 92.50% of cases, being Haemophilus influenzae present in 54.72% of children. Other pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolythic Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis. A statistically significant difference was observed when comparing S. pneumoniae carriage and non-carriage in less than 2 years-old children. The colonizing patterns of potentially pathogenic bacteria were disclosed in children attending a day care center in Havana City.
TI  - How do microbes evade neutrophil killing?
AB  - Many microbial pathogens evolved to circumvent the attack of neutrophils, which are essential effector cells of the innate immune system. Here we review six major strategies that pathogenic bacteria and fungi use to evade neutrophil defences: (i) turning on survival and stress responses, (ii) avoiding contact, (iii) preventing phagocytosis, (iv) surviving intracellularly, (v) inducing cell death and (vi) evading killing by neutrophil extracellular traps. For each category we give examples and further focus on one particular pathogenic microbe in more detail. Pathogens include Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Yersinia ssp., Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Development of a broad-range 16S rDNA real-time PCR for the diagnosis of septic arthritis in children.
AB  - The broad-range PCR has been successfully developed to search for fastidious, slow-growing or uncultured bacteria, and is mostly used when an empirical antibiotic treatment has already been initiated. The technique generally involves standard PCR targeting the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA, and includes a post-PCR visualisation step on agarose gel which is a potential source of cross-over contamination. In addition, interpretation of the presence of amplified products on gels can be difficult. We then developed a new SYBR Green-based, universal real-time PCR assay targeting the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA, coupled with sequencing of amplified products. The real-time PCR assay was evaluated on 94 articular fluid samples collected from children hospitalised for suspicion of septic arthritis, as compared to the results obtained with bacterial cultures and conventional broad-range PCR. DNA extraction was performed with the automated MagNa Pure system. We could detect DNA from various bacterial pathogens including fastidious bacteria (Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus) from 23% of cases of septic arthritis giving negative culture results. The real-time technique was easier to interpret and allowed to detect four more cases than conventional PCR. PCR based molecular techniques appear to be essential to perform in case of suspicion of septic arthritis, provided the increase of the diagnosed bacterial etiologies. Real-time PCR technique is a sensitive and reliable technique, which can replace conventional PCR for clinical specimens with negative bacterial culture.
TI  - Severe acute middle ear infections: microbiology and treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The database at the ENT-Department, Aarhus University Hospital describing the specific local flora of acute otitis media (AOM) and acute mastoiditis (AM) in Aarhus County has become the key element in securing a rational and specific antibiotic treatment. We present our data concerning AOM, mastoidismus and AM. Our purpose is to determine (I) clinical presentation, (II) causative pathogens, (III) resistance patterns, (IV) type of antibiotic treatment, and (V) accuracy of the antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Patients under the age of 18 years, treated for AOM with extensive affected well-being and AM, at the ENT-Department, Aarhus University Hospital during 3 years from January 2001 to December 2003. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were identified. Sixty-seven patients with AOM and 39 patients with AM. The overall bacterial flora found is dominated by S. pneumococci all 100% susceptible to penicillin. However, Staphylococcus aureus is the primary bacterial pathogens cultured from patients treated with preadmission antibiotics. CONCLUSION: If a specimen from an AOM patient is obtained after the initiation of antibiotic treatment one should consider the possibility of the culture found being a result of the initial led treatment and not the causative AOM pathogen. Our data suggest that a restricted use of antibiotics in children with AOM may be associated with a higher incidence of acute mastoiditis. Significant higher leucocytes count and CRP are found in the acute mastoiditis group compared to the AOM group.
TI  - [Etiology and rational therapy of severe otitis media purulenta acuta in children].
AB  - Etiology and antibiotic susceptibility of the pathogens of otitis media purulenta acuta in children was studied within 2000-2005. A total of 161 children at the age of 1 to 14 years were examined. The middle ear discharge collected during paracentosis (79.5%) or spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (20.5%) was used in the bacteriological tests. The microflora growth in the culture was detected in 80% of the cases. The leading pathogen was Streptococcus pyogenes (47.5%), the part of Streptococcus pneumoniae amounted to 36.6% of all the etiologically significant microflora, the part of Staphylococcus aureus amounted to 6.9% and that of Haemophilus influenzae amounted to 4.0%. The part of the associations of 2 microorganisms equaled 5.0%. The species composion of the pathogens differed from that described in the literature. The isolates of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were characterized by low resistance to macrolides (4.0-6.3%). As for the S. pneumoniae isolates, 97.3% of them was susceptible to penicillin. The results of the etiology study and the pathogen antibiotic susceptibility showed that the drugs of choice for the empirical antibacterial therapy of otitis media purulenta acuta in children should be amoxicillin and 1st generation cepholosporins. When the antibacterial therapy within the first 3 days fails, it is advisable to use protected aminopenicillins or 2nd generation cephalosporins. In case of the drug intolerance, macrolide antibiotics should be used.
TI  - Community-acquired bloodstream infections in children > one month old in southern Israel (1992-2001): epidemiological, clinical and microbiological aspects.
AB  - We studied the epidemiology, microbiology, clinical picture and outcome of community-acquired bloodstream infections (CABI) in children in southern Israel during 1992-2001. Information was collected prospectively by daily surveillance. CABI was diagnosed when a positive blood culture was reported in a patient discharged from the emergency room or during <48 h since admission if hospitalized. There were 1439 CABI episodes in 1396 children aged 1 month to 14 y. CABI incidence was 100/100,000 children with no increase during the study period. Risk of CABI was 3.8 times higher in a Bedouin than in a Jewish child. 1561 bacteria (793, 50%, gram-positive and 768, 49% gram-negative organisms, respectively) and 13 fungi were recovered. Most frequent gram-positive organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (509 isolates, 32% of all isolates, 64% of all gram-positive), Staphylococcus aureus (137, 9%, 17%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (46, 3%, 6%). Enterobacteriaceae spp. were the most frequent gram-negative pathogens (279, 18%, 36%), followed by Brucella (205, 13%, 27%). S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in children <12 months and 1-5 y age; Brucella was the most frequent pathogen in children >5 y of age. Coverage of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine for CABI was 38.5%. 38 (2.7%) patients died; 16 cases were caused by S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Increased recovery of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae in association with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci in healthy children and those with pharyngo-tonsillitis.
AB  - The inflamed tonsils harbour numerous types of bacteria, alone or in combination  with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). The cohabitation of the tonsils by GABHS and certain other bacterial species may contribute to the inflammatory process and the failure of penicillin therapy. This study evaluated the recovery of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in association with GABHS in healthy children and those with acute pharyngo-tonsillitis (APT). Pharyngo-tonsillar cultures were obtained from 548 children with APT and 866 healthy children. GABHS was recovered from 112 (20.4%) children with APT. Of the 114 H. influenzae isolates, 32 were recovered in association with GABHS (29% of all patients who had GABHS) and 82 were isolated without GABHS (19%) (P=0.0267). Of the 69 M. catarrhalis isolates, 25 were recovered in association with GABHS (22% of all patients who had GABHS) and 44 were isolated without GABHS (10%) (P=0.0012). In contrast, there was no association between the isolation of GABHS and the recovery of Staph. aureus or Strep. pneumoniae. GABHS was recovered from 104 (12%) healthy children. Of the 69 M. catarrhalis isolates, 24 were recovered in association with GABHS (23% of all patients who had GABHS) and 80 were isolated without GABHS (10%) (P=0.006). There was no association between the isolation of GABHS and the recovery of H. influenzae, Staph. aureus or Strep. pneumoniae. This study demonstrates an association between the recovery of GABHS and H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis from pharyngo-tonsillar cultures of patients with APT and M. catarrhalis from pharyngo-tonsillar cultures of healthy children.
TI  - Macrolide resistance can be transferred by conjugation from viridans streptococci to Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Efflux pumps encoded by mef genes are among the most common mechanisms of resistance to macrolides. These genes are often located on horizontally transferable elements such as transposons. We present data indicating conjugative transfer of the mef(E) gene from viridans streptococci to the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. The mef(E) gene is located on the previously described MEGA (macrolide efflux genetic assembly) element. Of 110 isolates tested, 85% of those that carried the mef(A/E) gene carried it on MEGA, and in all cases of conjugal transfer of the mef(E) gene it was carried on MEGA. It therefore appears reasonable to draw the conclusion that this element is important in the lateral transfer of macrolide resistance between streptococci.
TI  - Coenzyme Q10 production in recombinant Escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  - In the present work, Escherichia coli DH5alpha was metabolically engineered for CoQ(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsA) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Grown in 2YTG medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial pH of 7, the recombinant E. coli was capable of CoQ(10) production up to 470 microg/gDCW (dry cell weight). This value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gDCW simply by increasing the initial culture pH from 7 to 9. Supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. However, engineering of a lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the CoQ(10) production. Lower mevalonate semi-pathways of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. Among these, the pathway of Streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding CoQ(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gDCW when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mM. In order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. In a recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as DdsA enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-CoA to IPP, resulting in CoQ(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gDCW, without mevalonate supplementation. In contrast, a whole mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. However, it provided CoQ(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gDCW, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsA alone.
TI  - Frequency of recovery of pathogens causing acute maxillary sinusitis in adults before and after introduction of vaccination of children with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - The objective of the study was to compare the proportions of the recovery of pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in adults in the 4-year period prior to the 5-year period that followed the introduction of vaccination of children with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). Cultures were obtained through endoscopy from 385 adults with acute maxillary sinusitis, 156 between 1997 and 2000, and 229 between 2001 and 2005. One hundred and seventeen potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from the cultures obtained between 1997 and 2000. The predominant organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (54 or 46 % of all isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (42 or 36 %), Moraxella catarrhalis (7 or 6 %), Streptococcus pyogenes (8 or 7 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (6 or 5 %). One hundred and sixty-seven potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from the cultures obtained between 2001 and 2005. The most predominant organisms were H. influenzae non-type b (71 or 43 % of all isolates), Strep. pneumoniae (58 or 35 %), M. catarrhalis (13 or 8 %), Strep. pyogenes (12 or 7 %) and Staph. aureus (13 or 8 %). Significant statistical differences were noted in the rates of recovery of H. influenzae non-type b (P < 0.05) and Strep. pneumoniae (P < 0.05). A decrease occurred in the recovery of Strep. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin from 41 to 29 %, and an increase was noted in the isolation of beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae from 33 to 39 %; however, neither change was statistically significant. These data illustrate that a significant shift occurred in the causative pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in adults in the 5 years after the introduction of vaccination of children with the PCV7 compared to the previous 4 years.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of propolis and its active principles alone and in combination with macrolides, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones against microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - Propolis is produced by bees and is reported to have several pharmaceutical properties. Its antibacterial activity against strains causing upper respiratory tract infections is particularly important: propolis might be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent the bacterial infections that sometimes overlap viral infections. In this study the in vitro activity of both an alcoholic solution and a hydroglyceric extract of propolis, as well as its active principles, was tested against bacteria responsible for respiratory infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes). We also evaluated the in vitro activity of a combination of propolis and its active principles and some beta-lactams, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Our results, though not demonstrating a clearly synergistic activity between antibiotics and propolis and its constituents, show the possibility of using natural preparations, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, to enhance antibacterial therapy.
TI  - In vitro activities of DX-619 and comparison quinolones against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel quinolone DX-619 was compared to those of currently available quinolones against U.S. clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. DX-619 was the most potent quinolone overall, indicating possible utility as an anti-gram-positive quinolone.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator "Dentavax".
AB  - The oral polybacterial immunomodulator Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. The stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. On days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte activation and PB phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. PB lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA, rIL-2, LPS and D were evaluated radiometrically. The production of TNF-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by ELISA. Ultrastructural morphologic changes in T and B lymphocyte populations were also investigated. Although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (CD57+/CD57-) CD8 T effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of PHA-responding (CD69+) T cells and PB phagocytizing cells. The most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with LPS+D and PHA+D on day 21. Electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of D on both T and B cell activity. TNF-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. Maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with D and LPS. An increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of D was found, with highest levels between days 7 and 21. Specific secretory IgA predominated in saliva as compared to IgM and IgG. Our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of Dentavax on PB lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity.
TI  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in acute and chronic mastoiditis.
AB  - Mastoiditis (M) is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. The incidence of M has decreased since the advent of antimicrobial agents. In the last decade, however, there has been a marked increased in the incidence of acute M in several communities, sometimes in association with the growing resistance of pneumococci. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophillus influenzae are the most common organisms recovered in acute M. Several recent studies demonstrated the predominance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this infection. However, because P. aeruginosa colonizes the ear canal it can contaminate specimens obtained through the non-sterile ear canal. P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria are the most common isolates in chronic M. Anaerobes predominate in studies where adequate methods for their isolation are employed. Management of uncomplicated M requires the administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement. If no improvement occurs within 48 h, surgical intervention and drainage may be necessary. The procedure generally employed is simple mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube placement. Radical mastoidectomy is performed only if there is no improvement after simple mastoidectomy.
TI  - Otomicroscopic findings and systemic interleukin-6 levels in relation to etiologic agent during experimental acute otitis media.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore whether it was possible to differentiate the clinical course and the otomicroscopic appearance of acute otitis media (AOM) caused by common otitis pathogens in an animal model. Systemic interleukin (IL)-6 levels as early markers for bacterial AOM were also studied. Four groups of rats were inoculated with either Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. The animals were monitored by otomicroscopy, photos of the tympanic membrane, cultures and IL-6 detection in serum the following 4 days. The gram-positive S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes induced severe AOM with opaque effusion behind the tympanic membrane, pronounced dilation of the vessels and spontaneous perforations. The gram-negative H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis induced a less severe infection with cloudy, sometimes foamy effusion, and no spontaneous perforations. With the otomicroscopic findings it was possible to distinguish between infections induced by gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. Detection of interleukin-6 in serum appeared to be of limited use for all infections except the pneumococcal AOM, but this needs to be further investigated.
TI  - [Aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  - The diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. During the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the Pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. Of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. One point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of Escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of Klebsiella pneumoniae were producers of this type of b-lactamases. Ninety-six point five percent of the 797 isolations of Salmonella serotipo Enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of Campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. Of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive to amoxyline. The Gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin B. Twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. Fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. Knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Antibiotic consumption and generation of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae:  the paradoxical impact of quinolones in a complex selective landscape.
AB  - The development of resistance to the different antibiotics by the majority of bacterial species of clinical importance seems unavoidable. However, not all drugs have the same efficiency to select for resistance. Large differences in the qualitative and quantitative consumption of antibiotics among countries are known to exist and several authors have consistently reported the direct relationship between consumption and selection of resistance for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli and beta-lactams and macrolides use. In Spain, extensive surveillance started in 1996, and the Willow (SAUCE) Project, to monitor and update resistance in respiratory pathogens and to couple those data with data concerning national antibiotic consumption (IMS) from both a temporal and geographical approach. Temporally, despite a continuous increase of 16% in quinolone consumption from 1997 to 2001, basically due to the arrival of respiratory quinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, a continuous linear increase in the resistance rates to ciprofloxacin in S. pneumoniae was not observed. There also was an inverse correlation between provincial consumption of quinolones and resistance to ciprofloxacin. Several hypotheses are proposed and discussed to explain these apparent paradoxical observations, such as the replacement of ciprofloxacin by more potent antipneumococcal quinolones, the possibility of an antibiotic pressure threshold, the influence of other nonquinolone drugs on the expression of ciprofloxacin-resistance biological costs, and the influence of changes in temporal or spatial prevalence of particular clones.
TI  - Study of upper respiratory tract bacterial flora: first report. Variations in upper respiratory tract bacterial flora in patients with acute upper respiratory tract infection and healthy subjects and variations by subject age.
AB  - With the appearance of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, there has been increasing debate concerning antimicrobial treatments for acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) and acute otitis media in children. This study compares the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in patients with AURTI (AURTI group; 710 subjects) and healthy subjects (HS group; 380 subjects). The comparisons were made between subjects aged 6 years or younger (0-6 subgroup: 330 subjects), between 7 and 74 years (7-74 subgroup: 668 subjects), and 75 years and older (92 subjects), because the subjects were subgrouped as described above dependent on the maturity of the protective immunity. In the HS group 7-74 subgroup, viridans group streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium sp. with a detection rate of 10% or more were classified as normal nasal flora (NNF), and Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were classified as drum cavity pathogens (DCP). In the 0-6 subgroup, although the detection rate for DCP bacteria in the AURTI group tended to be high, it did not reach a significant difference, whereas the detection rate for NNF bacteria was significantly lower. This trend was also observed to some degree in the other age subgroup. In the 0-6 subgroup, leukocyte infiltration observed with a microscope indicated the closest relationship between S. pneumoniae detection rate and detection quantity. These results suggest that in the 0-6 subgroup the tendency for patients with AURTI to have NNF bacteria as well as DCP bacteria should be taken into consideration.
TI  - Antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (Superbonder, Loctite, Brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. METHODS: We analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) S. aureus (ATCC 25923); (3) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; (4) Streptococcus pyogenes; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853); (8) Escherichia coli (ATCC25922); and (9) Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212). One drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees C and its growth examined after 24 hours. Bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. The samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. Among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the E. coli and the E. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Effect of telithromycin and azithromycin on nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of the ketolide telithromycin compared with azithromycin in eradicating S pneumoniae from the nasopharynx of adults with acute maxillary sinusitis. The growing resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin and macrolides brought about the development of a new class of antibiotics-the ketolides-that are effective against resistant pneumococci. SETTING: Otolaryngology clinic. PATIENTS: One-hundred five patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. INTERVENTIONS: Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained before therapy and 10 to 12 days after initiation of treatment. Fifty-nine patients were treated with 500 mg of azithromycin daily for 3 days and 46 were treated with 800 mg of telithromycin daily for 5 days. RESULTS: Sixty-seven potential pathogens were recovered prior to initiation of therapy in 57 patients, 32 treated with telithromycin and 25 treated with azithromycin: S pneumoniae (31 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (non-type b) (13), Staphylococcus aureus (8), Streptococcus pyogenes (8), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7). The distribution of the pathogens was similar in both groups. The number of S pneumoniae isolates in the azithromycin group was reduced following treatment from 14 to 8 (43% reduction), and 5 of these 8 isolates were resistant to azithromycin. In contrast, the number of S pneumoniae isolates in the telithromycin group was reduced following treatment from 17 to 1 (94% reduction) (P < .01). This isolate was susceptible to azithromycin and telithromycin. No differences were noted in the eradication rate of all of the other potential pathogens, which were all susceptible to both azithromycin and telithromycin. Development of resistance to the antimicrobial agents used (defined as increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration by at least 2 tubes) was found only in 5 isolates (4 S pneumoniae and 1 H influenzae) recovered only from patients who received azithromycin (P < .05). CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the superiority of telithromycin to azithromycin in the eradication of S pneumoniae from the nasopharynx.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of pathogens in clinical samples from patients with community-acquired pneumonia by real-time PCR with pathogen-specific molecular beacon probes.
AB  - In this study, real-time PCR with pathogen-specific molecular beacons (MB) and primers was evaluated for prediction of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) causative agents, detecting six main CAP agents, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Streptococcus pyogenes, simultaneously. The PCR assay was evaluated for fresh clinical specimens from infants and children (n = 389) and from adults (n = 40). The MB probes and primers are both pathogen specific, namely, the lytA gene for S. pneumoniae, the mip gene for L. pneumophila, and 16S rRNA genes for the remaining four organisms. DNA extraction of clinical specimens was performed with a commercially available EXTRAGEN II kit, and amplification was performed with Stratagene Mx3000P. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 2 copies to 18 copies. The whole process from DNA extraction to the analysis was finished in less than 2 h. The obtained sensitivity and specificity of this real-time PCR study relative to those of conventional cultures were as follows: 96.2% and 93.2% for S. pneumoniae, 95.8% and 95.4% for H. influenzae, 100% and 100% for S. pyogenes, and 100% and 95.4% for M. pneumoniae, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for M. pneumoniae relative to those of a serologic assay were 90.2% and 97.9%, respectively. In six clinical samples of C. pneumoniae, the real-time PCR gave positive predictable values, and in those cases, elevation of the titer value was also observed. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a real-time PCR assay with pathogen-specific MB is useful in identifying CAP causative agents rapidly and in examining the clinical course of empirical chemotherapy in a timely manner, supporting conventional culture methods.
TI  - Penicillin resistance is not extrapolable to amoxicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from middle ear fluid in children with acute otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the in vitro antibacterial activity of amoxicillin against penicillin-susceptible and -nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from children with acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: Children more than 3 months of age with AOM who were seen in the Dr Sotero del Rio and Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospitals in Santiago, Chile, between July 1998 and December 2002 were subjected to tympanic puncture for middle ear fluid culture. The penicillin and amoxicillin susceptibilities of the S pneumoniae isolates were determined by epsilometer test (E test). RESULTS: A bacterial pathogen was isolated in 432 of 543 children (80%) as follows: S pneumoniae, 40%; Haemophilus influenzae, 29%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 7%; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 4%. Penicillin-susceptible S pneumoniae strains were less common than amoxicillin-susceptible strains (60% versus 95%; odds ratio [OR], 0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.18). Both intermediate- and high-resistance strains were more common for penicillin (22% versus 4.5%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.5 to 12.7) than for amoxicillin (18% versus 0.5%; OR, 41.3; 95% CI, 6.0 to 821). CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin resistance is not extrapolable to amoxicillin among S pneumoniae strains isolated from middle ear fluid of children with AOM. Our results support the recommendation to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin-nonsusceptible S pneumoniae for amoxicillin and to continue use of this antimicrobial as a first-line antimicrobial choice for children with AOM.
TI  - The Viriato Study: update of antimicrobial susceptibility data of bacterial pathogens from community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Portugal in 2003 and 2004.
AB  - The Viriato Study is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter surveillance study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Portugal. In 2003 and 2004 a total of 2945 isolates was recovered in the 29 laboratories that participated in the study. Testing was undertaken in a central laboratory. Of the 513 Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from patients with acute tonsillitis all were susceptible to penicillin and other beta-lactams but 18.9% were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. The M phenotype dominated (67%), conferring resistance to erythromycin (MIC90 = 16 mg/L), clarythromycin and azithromycin, but susceptibility to clindamycin (MIC90 = 0.094 mg/L). From patients with lower respiratory tract infection 1,300 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 829 of Haemophilus influenzae, and 303 of Moraxella catarrhalis were studied. Among S. pneumoniae isolates 18.4% were resistant to penicillin (3.5% showing high-level resistance), 7.1% to cefuroxime, 0.5% to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, 18.8% to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin, 14.9% to tetracycline, 16.5% to co-trimoxazole, and 0.4% to levofloxacin. Beta-lactamases were produced by 10.0% of H. influenzae and 96.4% of M. catarrhalis. In H. influenzae resistance to clarithromycin was 5.5% and to co-trimoxazole was 13.4%. Most strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, azithromycin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. In M. catarrhalis resistance to co-trimoxazole was 27.1% and to tetracycline 1.0%. All strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. Penicillin was the most active antimicrobial agent against S. pyogenes and amoxycillin/clavulanate and the quinolones the most active in vitro simultaneously against S. pneumoniae, H. influenza and M. catarrhalis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Changing epidemiology of outpatient bacteremia in 3- to 36-month-old children after the introduction of the heptavalent-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has changed the overall incidence of bacteremia in children 3 months-3 years old. OBJECTIVE: To describe the changing incidence and etiology of bacteremia in previously healthy toddlers presenting to outpatient clinical settings. METHODS: Retrospective case series of all blood cultures obtained between September 1998 and August 2003 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California outpatient clinics and emergency departments from previously healthy children 3 months-3 years old. RESULTS: Implementation of routine vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine resulted in an 84% reduction of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3-0.2%) and a 67% reduction in overall bacteremia (1.6-0.7%) in the study population. The rate of blood culture isolation of contaminating organisms remained unchanged at 1.8%; therefore, by the end of the study, >70% of organisms identified in blood cultures were contaminants. During the 5 study years, total blood cultures drawn decreased by 35% in outpatient pediatric clinics but remained unchanged in emergency departments. By 2003, one-third of all pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, one-third were non-vaccine serotype S. pneumoniae, the majority of the remaining one-third were Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. In our population of children routinely immunized with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, a white blood cell count >15,000 by itself is a poor predictor of bacteremia in the febrile toddler (sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 54.5%; positive predictive value, 1.5%; negative predictive value, 99.5%). CONCLUSION: In the United States, routine vaccinations with Haemophilus influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae vaccines have made bacteremia in the previously healthy toddler a rare event. As the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia has decreased, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus have increased in relative importance. The use of the white blood cell count alone to guide the empiric use of antibiotics is not indicated. New guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient setting.
TI  - The use of macrolides in treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem among upper respiratory tract pathogens. Resistance to beta-lactam drugs among Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes is increasing. As safe and well-tolerated antibiotics, macrolides play a key role in the treatment of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Their broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive cocci, such as S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, atypical pathogens, H. influenzae (azithromycin and clarithromycin), and Moraxella catarrhalis, has led to the widespread use of macrolides for empiric treatment of upper RTIs and as alternatives for patients allergic to beta-lactams. Macrolide resistance is increasing among pneumococci and recently among S. pyogenes, and is associated with increasing use of the newer macrolides, such as azithromycin. Ribosomal target modification mediated by erm(A) and erm(B) genes and active efflux due to mef(A) and mef(E) are the principal mechanisms of resistance in both S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Recently, ribosomal protein and RNA mutations have been found to be responsible for acquired resistance to macrolides in S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae. Although macrolides are only weakly active against macrolide-resistant streptococci species, producing an efflux pump (mef), and are inactive against pathogens with ribosomal target modification (erm), treatment failures are uncommon. Therefore, macrolide therapy, for now, remains a good alternative for treatment of upper RTIs; however, continuous monitoring of the local resistance patterns is essential.
TI  - [Parapneumonic pleural effusion: an 11-year review].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last few years, the incidence of parapneumonic effusions in  children with community-acquired pneumonia seems to have increased. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features and incidence of parapneumonic effusions throughout an 11-year period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged < 15 years old with parapneumonic effusions from 1993 to 2003. Annual incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 children < 15 years old from Health Area 5 of Madrid and per 100 children hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department of our hospital. The linear association test was used to compare the incidence rates over the previous 11 years. RESULTS: There were 130 patients with parapneumonic pleural effusions. The mean age was 4.7 years. Forty-one percent received antibiotics before diagnosis. The causative organisms were identified in 42 patients (32.3%). The most effective diagnostic method was pleural-fluid culture (18/58, 31%). The most common organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (18), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Haemophilus influenzae (3) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2). Thirty-two percent of the patients required pleural drainage and 16% underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Of 12 S. pneumoniae antibiograms available, 91.7% showed full susceptibility to penicillin and 75% were susceptible to erythromycin. The annual incidence of parapneumonic effusions rose from 18.1 in 1993 to 42.9 in 2003 (p < 0.001) per 100,000 children and from 0.76 in 1993 to 3.3 in 2003 (p < 0.001) per 100 children hospitalized in our unit. CONCLUSION: The incidence of parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia showed a statistically significant increase between 1993 and 2003. The most common causal organism was S. pneumoniae, with a low rate of penicillin resistance.
TI  - Characterization of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. isolated in North America and Europe including the first report of fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2004).
AB  - Beta-hemolytic streptococci are common bacterial pathogens that can cause serious invasive disease, and although this group of species has remained susceptible to the fluoroquinolone class, resistant strains have been reported. This multicenter investigation determined the rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci using the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program network data (1997-2004). Forty-seven surveillance culture isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci from North America and Europe with elevated levofloxacin MIC results (2 to >32) microg/mL were tested for susceptibility to other fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, garenoxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin using reference broth microdilution and Etest (BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) methods. Strains were characterized using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to detect mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR). The beta-hemolytic streptococci isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility included the following Lancefield groups: A (Streptococcus pyogenes; 9 strains), B (Streptococcus agalactiae; 24 strains), C and G (14 strains). Vitek and API 20 strep (bioMerieux, Hazelwood, MO) identification systems, as well as conventional biochemical methods and colony morphology, were used to confirm the organism identifications. The overall potency (MIC90 in microg/mL) for the fluoroquinolones against all tested beta-hemolytic streptococci showed the following rank order: gemifloxacin (0.06) > garenoxacin (0.12) > moxifloxacin (0.25) > gatifloxacin (0.5) > levofloxacin = ciprofloxacin (1). The rate of levofloxacin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci in the SENTRY program was 0.14% (Europe) and 0.51% (North America) during the study period. All levofloxacin-resistant strains tested by molecular methods had significant mutations in either parC (position 79 or 83) and/or gyrA (position 81 or 85). All but 2 isolates with high-level resistance to levofloxacin (>32 microg/mL) had gyrA mutations. Strains with lower MIC values to levofloxacin (2-4 microg/mL) only had mutations in parC. The increasing rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and the more recently reported beta-hemolytic streptococci, is becoming a clinical concern due to the morbidity and mortality caused by these pathogens.
TI  - Epithelial cells are sensitive detectors of bacterial pore-forming toxins.
AB  - Epithelial cells act as an interface between human mucosal surfaces and the surrounding environment. As a result, they are responsible for the initiation of local immune responses, which may be crucial for prevention of invasive infection. Here we show that epithelial cells detect the presence of bacterial pore-forming toxins (including pneumolysin from Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus, streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes, and anthrolysin O from Bacillus anthracis) at nanomolar concentrations, far below those required to cause cytolysis. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK appears to be a conserved response of epithelial cells to subcytolytic concentrations of bacterial poreforming toxins, and this activity is inhibited by the addition of high molecular weight osmolytes to the extracellular medium. By sensing osmotic stress caused by the insertion of a sublethal number of pores into their membranes, epithelial cells may act as an early warning system to commence an immune response, while the local density of toxin-producing bacteria remains low. Osmosensing may thus represent a novel innate immune response to a common bacterial virulence strategy.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel C12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  - A novel series of C12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. The C12 modification involves replacing the natural C12 methyl group in the erythromycin core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. From the C12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of C12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. Several compounds were found to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. The C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. However, the pharmacokinetic profiles of C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. These pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens in Japan during PROTEKT years 1-3 (1999-2002).
AB  - Data are presented on antimicrobial resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptoco-ccus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis collected in Japan during years 1-3 (1999-2002) of the Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin (PROTEKT) surveillance study. In addition to the standard panel of PROTEKT antimicrobial agents, eight other agents often used in Japan also were tested against these isolates. The majority (30%-55%) of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae isolates were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, whereas most (>70%) S. pyogenes isolates came from patients with tonsillitis/pharyngitis. Penicillin and macrolide resistance were high among isolates of S. pneumoniae, averaging 30.9%-44.5% and 77.2%-79.9%, respectively, across all centers over the 3 study years; the highest occurrences were reported among pediatric patients aged 0-2 years. The erm(B) genotype accounted for >50% of all erythromycin-resistant isolates each study year. S. pyogenes isolates were highly susceptible to most antimicrobial agents except the macrolides and tetracycline. beta-Lactamase production among H. influenzae isolates range was 8.5%-9.7% per annum. A total of 9 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates were collected during the study. Almost all (>95%) M. catarrhalis isolates were beta-lactamase positive each year. Telithromycin was highly active against all pathogens examined in this study during all 3 years.
TI  - Susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. Individual dimers displayed equivalent or lowered MIC values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli, and VRE. Raised MIC values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against M. tuberculosis. Structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower MICs against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus. In contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of MICs against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.
TI  - Changes in macrolide resistance among respiratory pathogens after decreased erythromycin consumption in Taiwan.
AB  - Measures to alleviate the growing problem of macrolide resistance in Taiwan resulted in a decrease in macrolide consumption, from 0.629 defined daily doses/1000 inhabitants per day (DIDs) in 1999 to 0.301 DIDs in 2003 (a reduction of 52%). A linear relationship was observed between the decline in erythromycin consumption and the decline in erythromycin resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes (46% in 1999 vs. 17% in 2003; p < 0.001) and azithromycin resistance in Haemophilus influenzae (31% in 2000 vs. 0% in 2003; p < 0.001). However, the rate of erythromycin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae showed a continued increase, from 80.2% in 1999 to 92% in 2003.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Eucalyptus globulus leaf extract on pathogenic bacteria  isolated from specimens of patients with respiratory tract disorders.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Eucalyptus globulus leaf extract was determined for 56 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 25 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 12 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and seven isolates of Haemophilus influenzae obtained from 200 clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract disorders. MIC50s for these species were 64, 32, 16 and 16 mg/L, respectively; MIC90s were 128, 64, 32 and 32 mg/L, respectively; and MBCs were 512, 128, 64 and 64 mg/L, respectively. These results suggest that further studies to clarify the possible therapeutic role of E. globulus leaf extract in the treatment of respiratory tract infection are warranted.
TI  - Changes in pharyngeal aerobic microflora in oral breathers after palatal rapid expansion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate in oral breathing children the qualitative and quantitative effects on aerobic and facultatively anaerobic oropharyngeal microflora of respiratory function improved by rapid palatal expansion (RPE). METHODS: In an open clinical trial, we studied 50 oral breathers, aged 8 to 14 years and suffering from both maxillary constriction and posterior cross-bite. At baseline, patients were examined by a single otorhinolaryngologist (ENT), confirming nasal obstruction in all subjects by posterior rhino-manometric test. Patients were evaluated three times by oropharyngeal swabs:1) at baseline (T = 0); 2) after palatal spreading out (T = 1); and 3) at the end of RPE treatment (T = 2). With regard to the microbiological aspect, the most common and potentially pathogenic oral microrganisms (i.e. Streptococcus pyogenes, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus spp, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans) were specifically detected in proper culture plates, isolated colonies were identified by means of biochemical tests and counted by calibrated loop. The data were analyzed by means of the following tests: Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon's test. RESULTS: After the use of RME there was a statistically significant decrease of Staphylococcus aureus stock at CFU/mLat T1(P = 0.0005; Z = -3,455 by Wilcoxon Rank test) and T2 (P < 0.0001; Z = -4,512 by Wilcoxon Rank test) vs T0. No significant changes were found for the other examined microrganisms. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that RPE therapy in oral breathers may strongly reduce the pathogenic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microflora in the oral pharynx after a normalization of the upper airways function, and may reduce the risk of respiratory infections.

TI  - [Community-acquired acute maxillary sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in adults in France: current management].
AB  - Sinus infections, often viral, are a common reason for physician visits. The multiplicity of clinical presentations makes its diagnosis difficult. The problem is to recognize bacterial infection without additional testing, except in cases of treatment failures, complications or relapse. Patients with signs suggestive of rhinosinusitis fall into one of four basic clinical situations: common colds, 'doubtful' rhinosinusitis, apparent acute maxillary bacterial rhinosinusitis, and complications. Anterior rhinoscopy may help confirm diagnosis. Current bacterial epidemiology is based on the results of clinical studies, microbial ecology, and samples taken in cases of treatment failure. The two bacteria isolated most frequently are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, both of which pose resistance problems. Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are isolated less often. The dominant issue in management of acute rhinosinusitis is whether to use antibiotic or symptomatic treatment. For viral infections, antibiotic therapy is useless and highly inadvisable. For 'doubtful' infections, symptomatic treatment is likely to lead to recovery. The use of non-recommended antibiotics also increases the risk of selection of resistant bacteria. When bacterial rhinosinusitis is strongly suspected, recourse to antibiotic treatment is recommended in view of the benefits in this situation (AFSSAPS 2005). This treatment is probabilistic, should be decided at the end of the consultation, and follows the AFSSAPS guidelines.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - [Acute ethmoiditis in children, a series of 125 cases].
AB  - Acute ethmoiditis are bacterial infections of ethmoid sinuses, which may spread to the orbital or the endocranial spaces. It is essential to fit the antibiotherapy to the bacteria responsible for these infections. POPULATION AND METHODS: The charts of children hospitalized from 1995 to 2003 for an acute ethmoiditis were reviewed, particularly the results of bacterial exams and the antibiotics delivered. RESULTS: Over this 9-year period, 125 children (mean age 4.5 years) were hospitalized for acute ethmoiditis. Eighty were checked for blood cultures, which were sterile in 73 cases, and in the other cases, grew Staphylococcus, S. Pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Seric soluble antigens were absent in the 5 cases where they were looked for. Ten children had a puncture of a subperiostal abscess: it was sterile in 5 cases, Staphylococcus was found in 4 cases, S. pneumoniae in the last case. Most children received an association of cefotaxim and fosfomycine for a mean duration of 5.6 days. Thirteen per cent of the children received 3 or 4 antibiotics. DISCUSSION: It is always difficult to found the bacteria responsible for an acute ethmoiditis. In our serie as in others, the most frequent bacteria were Staphylococcus, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. CONCLUSION: In view of the bacteria responsible for these infections and their antibiotic resistance, we suggest the association of cefotaxim and fosfomycin for the first line of treatment of acute ethmoiditis.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - Evaluation of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel was evaluated for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of various streptococci. A group of 97 consecutive clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 24 Streptococcus agalactiae, and 34 viridans streptococci were collected and comparisons made with routine manual methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Overall, in 162 (91%) of 178 isolates, Phoenix identification results demonstrated agreement. For AST results for the 162 isolates that demonstrated identification concordance, the overall essential agreement rate was 98.5%; the category agreement was 94.9%; and the very major error, major error, and minor error rates were 0%, 0.15%, and 5.8%, respectively. Although relatively high minor error rates were observed with S. pneumoniae and beta-lactams, 79.2% of the 77 minor errors were the result of a single log(2) dilution difference. The Phoenix SMIC/ID panel performed favorably and demonstrated the advantages of automation and simple methodology.
TI  - Activity of the new quinolones WCK 771, WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The new fluoroquinolones WCK 771, WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 were developed to overcome quinolone resistance in Gram-positive bacteria. The activity of these new quinolones was tested against 159 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 52 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes using the microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/L) of WCK 771, WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 for quinolone-susceptible S. pneumoniae (n = 119; 54 penicillin G-susceptible, 53 penicillin G-intermediate, and 12 penicillin G-resistant strains) were 0.25/0.5, 0.03/0.06 and 0.016/0.03, respectively. MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/L) for quinolone-resistant pneumococci (n = 40) increased to 4/16, 0.25/1 and 0.125/0.5, respectively. Against S. pyogenes, WCK 771, WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 were also highly active with MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/L) of 0.25/0.25, 0.03/0.06 and 0.03/0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, WCK 771 was highly active against quinolone-susceptible, but not against quinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae, whereas WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 were more potent and were able to overcome quinolone resistance in both S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes.
TI  - The impact of homologous recombination on the generation of diversity in bacteria.
AB  - The imprint of demographic and selective processes on bacterial population structure needs to be evaluated as deviation from the expectations of an appropriate null neutral model. We explore the impact of varying the population mutation and recombination rates theta and rho on ideal populations, using a recently developed model of neutral drift at multiple loci. This model may be fitted to experimental data to provide estimates of these parameters, and we do so for seven bacterial species (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Bacillus cereus), illustrating that bacterial species vary extensively in these fundamental parameters. Historically, the influence of recombination has often been estimated through its influence on the Index of Association I(A). We show that this may be relatively insensitive to changes in either mutation or recombination rates. It is known that biased sampling can lead to artificially high estimates of I(A). We therefore provide a method of precisely separating the effects of such bias and true linkage between alleles. We also demonstrate that by fitting the neutral model to experimental data, more informative and precise estimates of the relative roles of recombination and mutation may be obtained.
TI  - Eradication of pathogens from the nasopharynx after therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis with low- or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  - The growing resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin can be overcome  by increasing the dose of the penicillin administered. This generated the recommendation that the adult dose of amoxicillin for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) be increased from 1.5 g/day to 4.0 g/day. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the higher dose of amoxicillin is more effective than the previously recommended dose in eradicating S. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx of patients who present with AMS. Nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 58 patients with AMS were studied: 30 received amoxicillin 1.5 g/day given in divided doses three times a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 4:1 formulation) and 28 were treated with amoxicillin 4.0 g/day given in divided doses twice a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 16:1 formulation). Seventy-one potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated: S. pneumoniae (27 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (25), Moraxella catarrhalis (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (9). The number of S. pneumoniae isolates in the 1.5 g/day group was reduced from 14 to 9 (2 intermediately resistant and 3 highly resistant). In contrast, the number of S. pneumoniae isolates in the 4.0 g/day group was reduced from 13 to 2 (1 highly resistant) (P<0.05). No differences were noted in the eradication rate of other groups of isolates, which were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. These data illustrate the superiority of 4.0 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared with 1.5 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the eradication of S. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx.
TI  - Distribution of mef(A)-containing genetic elements in erythromycin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes from Italy.
AB  - In total, 124 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were obtained from throat cultures  of different symptomatic patients. All isolates showed M-phenotype macrolide resistance and contained the macrolide efflux gene mef(A). The isolates were screened for the presence and insertion site of mef(A)-containing genetic elements. In 25.8% of the isolates, mef(A) was found to be carried by elements belonging to the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family inserted in the comEC gene, while 74.2% contained chimeric elements with a different genetic structure and chromosomal location, probably associated with the recently described 60-kb tet(O)-mef(A) element.
TI  - Single-dose azithromycin for the treatment of children with acute otitis media.
AB  - Azithromycin is an azalide with in vitro activity against otitis media pathogens, good middle ear penetration and a prolonged half-life. A total of four clinical trials have evaluated the clinical success rate, safety and compliance of single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) in the treatment of children with otitis media. Among all the patients treated with single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg), and presented previously in four published clinical trials, end-of-treatment clinical success was 88% (544 out of 619) and maintained clinical success at the end-of-study was 82% (498 out of 610). Three of the four studies included a mandatory baseline tympanocentesis. The overall end-of-treatment and end-of-study clinical success rates among all culture-positive patients was 84% (222 out of 263) and 80% (210 out of 263), respectively. Per pathogen end-of-treatment clinical success rates observed were 91% (125 out of 137) among patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 77% (75 out of 97) among patients with Haemophilus influenzae, 100% (14 out of 14) among patients with Moraxella catarrhalis, 64% (seven out of 11) among patients with baseline Streptococcus pyogenes and 25% (one out of four) among patients with a S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae mixed infection. Clinical success was observed in 90% (106 out of 118) of patients with baseline macrolide-susceptible S. pneumoniae and in 67% (14 out of 21) among patients with baseline macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (p = 0.01). Adverse events were uncommon, mostly mild and transitory gastrointestinal complaints, and in the two larger comparative trials, were less frequent than the rates observed with the comparator agents. Compliance was excellent (99-100%). Single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) represents an alternative for the treatment of pediatric patients with uncomplicated acute otitis media, particularly in those geographic regions where high-level S. pneumoniae macrolide resistance is uncommon, and for those patients that require directly observed therapy or when compliance may be a problem.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Comparison and transferability of the erm (B) genes between human and farm animal streptococci.
AB  - To obtain better insights into the possible exchange of resistance genes between  human and animal streptococci, the sequences of the erm (B) genes of streptococcal isolates from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, chickens, and calves were compared. Identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in strains from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, and calves. During in vitro mating experiments, the erm (B) gene was exchanged between porcine Streptococcus suis and human S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. oralis strains. The presence of different tetracycline resistance genes and the int Tn 1545 gene was determined in animal streptococci carrying the erm (B) gene. Although tet(M) and int Tn 1545 genes were detected in 24% of the porcine and pork carcass streptococcal strains, the tet(O) gene was the predominant tetracycline resistance gene in these strains (81%). The latter gene was co-transferred with the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis strains to human streptococci in the mating experiments. These results show that, identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in animal and human streptococci and that transfer of the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis to human streptococci and vice versa is possible, but probably occurs at a low frequency.
TI  - Ketolide resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes correlates with the degree of rRNA  dimethylation by Erm.
AB  - Macrolide and ketolide antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis on the bacterial ribosome. Resistance to these antibiotics is conferred by dimethylation at 23S rRNA nucleotide A2058 within the ribosomal binding site. This form of resistance is encoded by erm dimethyltransferase genes, and is found in many pathogenic bacteria. Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae with constitutive erm(B) and Streptococcus pyogenes with constitutive erm(A) subtype (TR) are resistant to macrolides, but remain susceptible to ketolides such as telithromycin. Paradoxically, some strains of S. pyogenes that possess an identical erm(B) gene are clinically resistant to ketolides as well as macrolides. Here we explore the molecular basis for the differences in these streptococcal strains using mass spectrometry to determine the methylation status of their rRNAs. We find a correlation between the levels of A2058-dimethylation and ketolide resistance, and dimethylation is greatest in S. pyogenes strains expressing erm(B). In constitutive erm strains that are ketolide-sensitive, appreciable proportions of the rRNA remain monomethylated. Incubation of these strains with subinhibitory amounts of the macrolide erythromycin increases the proportion of dimethylated A2058 (in a manner comparable with inducible erm strains) and reduces ketolide susceptibility. The designation 'constitutive' should thus be applied with some reservation for most streptococcal erm strains. One strain worthy of the constitutive designation is S. pyogenes isolate KuoR21, which has lost part of the regulatory region upstream of erm(B). In S. pyogenes KuoR21, nucleotide A2058 is fully dimethylated under all growth conditions, and this strain displays the highest resistance to telithromycin (MIC > 64 microg ml-1).
TI  - Mode of action and biochemical characterization of REP8839, a novel inhibitor of  methionyl-tRNA synthetase.
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have attracted interest as essential and novel targets involved in bacterial protein synthesis. REP8839 is a potent inhibitor of MetS, the methionyl-tRNA synthetase in Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and in Streptococcus pyogenes. The biochemical activity of REP8839 was shown by specific inhibition of purified S. aureus MetS (50% inhibitory concentration, <1.9 nM). Target specificity was confirmed by overexpression of the metS gene in S. aureus, resulting in an eightfold increase in the MIC for REP8839. Macromolecular synthesis assays in the presence of REP8839 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis and RNA synthesis in S. pneumoniae R6, but only protein synthesis was affected in an isogenic rel mutant deficient in the stringent response. Strains with reduced susceptibility to REP8839 were generated by selection of strains with spontaneous mutations and through serial passages. Point mutations within the metS gene were mapped, leading to a total of 23 different amino acid substitutions within MetS that were located around the modeled active site. The most frequent MetS mutations were I57N, leading to a shift in the MIC from 0.06 microg/ml to 4 microg/ml, and G54S, resulting in a MIC of 32 microg/ml that was associated with a reduced growth rate. The mutation prevention concentration was 32 microg/ml in four S. aureus strains (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and MRSA), which is well below the drug concentration of 2% (20,000 microg/ml) in a topical formulation. In conclusion, we demonstrate by biochemical, physiologic, and genetic mode-of-action studies that REP8839 exerts its antibacterial activity through specific inhibition of MetS, a novel target.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of REP8839, a new antibiotic for topical use.
AB  - REP8839 is a novel methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetS) inhibitor with potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other clinically important gram-positive bacteria but little activity against gram-negative bacteria. All isolates of S. aureus, including strains resistant to methicillin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and linezolid were susceptible to REP8839 at concentrations of < or =0.5 microg/ml. REP8839 was also active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains (MIC, < or =0.25 microg/ml). All S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to REP8839 at concentrations of < or =0.25 microg/ml, suggesting that MetS2, a second enzyme previously identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was not present in this organism. REP8839 was highly bound to the protein of human serum, and activity was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was affected by pH, exhibiting optimal antibacterial activity in a neutral medium rather than a weak acidic medium. Like mupirocin, REP8839 exhibited bacteriostatic activity against key pathogens. The emergence of mupirocin resistance in S. aureus highlights the need for a new topical antibiotic with the ability to inhibit high-level mupirocin-resistant strains and other emerging phenotypes, such as vancomycin-resistant and community-acquired methicillin-resistant isolates.
TI  - mef(A), mef(E) and a new mef allele in macrolide-resistant Streptococcus spp. isolates from Norway.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To type mef genes in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates of  Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes as well as pharyngeal carrier strains of viridans streptococci in Norway. METHODS: Erythromycin-resistant mef-positive multilocus sequence-typed (MLST) clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae (n = 36) and S. pyogenes (n = 12) from the National Surveillance Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (NORM) as well as viridans streptococci (n = 20) from healthy adults were included. PCR-amplified mef genes were initially discriminated by BamHI digestion. Selected mef genes from representatives of different sequence types (STs) of S. pneumoniae (n = 11) and S. pyogenes (n = 4), and viridans group streptococcal species (n = 8) were typed by sequencing and their strains examined for co-resistances. Hydropathy plots of different mef-encoded proteins were performed. RESULTS: A predominance of mef(A) was detected in S. pneumoniae (23/36) and S. pyogenes (9/12) due to the clonal spread of ST9 and ST39, respectively. mef(E) was the most widely distributed mef determinant occurring in nine different STs of S. pneumoniae and in four different viridans species. A new mef allele was identified in two STs of S. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: mef(E) is the most widely distributed mef determinant in Norwegian clinical strains of S. pneumoniae and pharyngeal carrier strains of various viridans streptococci. However, mef(A) is more prevalent in S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes due to clonal spread. A new mef allele was found in two different STs of S. pyogenes.
TI  - Evaluation of the BD Phoenix SMIC/ID, a new streptococci identification and antimicrobial susceptibility panel, for potential routine use in a university-based clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - We evaluated the new BD Phoenix automated microbiology system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) SMIC/ID-4 panel for routine identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of streptococci in a university-based laboratory. Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 92), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 24), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 10) were collected, and comparisons were made with the routine manual methods used in our microbiology laboratory for ID and susceptibility testing. ID concordance with manual methods was 85.9%, 95.8%, and 90.0% for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. With respect to AST concordance for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae) using Phoenix and standard broth microdilution panels, overall essential agreement was 93.0% and 97.5%, respectively, whereas overall category agreement was 92.4% and 98.9%, respectively. Major and minor error rates for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci were 0.5% and 0.3%, and 7.1% and 0.8%, respectively. Very major errors were not observed in this study. Mean time for ID and AST test completion was 13.6 +/- 1.6, 10.7 +/- 2.4, and 11.2 +/- 2.3 h for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. We have demonstrated that Phoenix ID results show high agreement with manual ID and that AST performance was equivalent to standard broth microdilution in less time.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Seventy-five years of neonatal sepsis at Yale: 1928-2003.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Yale-New Haven Hospital (Y-NHH) has maintained the longest running, single-center longitudinal database of neonatal sepsis, started in 1928. The objective of this study was to update this database with review of neonatal sepsis cases at Y-NHH to identify longitudinal trends in demographics, pathogens, and outcome. METHODS: Records of infants with positive blood cultures obtained while they were inpatients in the NICU at Y-NHH from 1989 to 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Records of infants who were < or =30 days of age, had positive blood cultures, and were hospitalized at Y-NHH outside the NICU from the same period were also reviewed, and all findings were compared with 60 years of preexisting data. RESULTS: A total of 862 organisms were identified in 755 episodes of sepsis from 647 infants. The percentage of cases of early-onset sepsis decreased and late-onset sepsis increased compared with the previous 10-year study period. A marked increase in cases as a result of commensal species was observed, particularly in preterm infants who had indwelling central vascular catheters, were receiving parenteral nutrition, and required prolonged mechanical ventilation. The overall percentage of sepsis caused by group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli decreased. No episodes of sepsis from Streptococcus pneumoniae or S pyogenes, common in the early years of the survey, were observed. The sepsis-related mortality rate steadily decreased, from 87% in 1928 to 3% in 2003. CONCLUSIONS: The demographics, pathogens, and outcome associated with neonatal sepsis continue to change. The increase in late-onset sepsis in preterm infants who required prolonged intensive care indicates that strategies to prevent infection are urgently needed for this population of infants.
TI  - Resistance to macrolides, clindamycin and telithromycin in Streptococcus pyogenes isolated in Spain during 2004.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of the different phenotypes and genotypes of macrolide resistance in group A streptococci isolated in Spain in 2004, and to compare the results with those obtained in 1998 and 2001 using the same methodology and centres. METHODS: A total of 530 unique isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes collected in 21 laboratories from 16 geographic areas (regions) in Spain were used. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the agar dilution method. Discs containing erythromycin or clindamycin were used to recognize the phenotypes of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance. Genes encoding macrolide-lincosamide resistance were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Resistance to erythromycin was 21.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 16.5-26.3]. The resistance to azithromycin was 21.5%, whereas the resistance to miocamycin and to clindamycin was 6.6% (95% CI 3.0-8.9). Thirty-one (5.8%) of the isolates were resistant to telithromycin. Of the 115 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 67.8% had the M phenotype, representing 14.7% of all the isolates tested. Thirty-five isolates (30.5% of the erythromycin-resistant strains and 6.6% of all the isolates) had the MLS(B) constitutive phenotype. There was a high prevalence of resistance to telithromycin (88.6%) among the 35 strains with the MLS(B) constitutive phenotype. When we compared these results with those from previous studies (1998 and 2001), we found a significant increase in the MLS(B) constitutive phenotype (P < 0.001), and a significant decrease in the M phenotype (P < 0.005) was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The significant increase in the prevalence of resistance to clindamycin and miocamycin, and the prevalence of resistance to telithromycin reached in a short period of time from the introduction of its use, underscore the need for continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in S. pyogenes in Spain.
TI  - [Streptococcus pyogenes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae: pulmonary coinfection or serologic artefact?].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: How should Mycoplasma pneumoniae seroconversion be interpreted in a patient with community-acquired Streptococcus pyogenes pneumonia? CASE: A 21-year-old man with cerebral palsy was hospitalized with acute pneumonia and fever. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained Streptococcus pyogenes, and serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae was positive. At 4 weeks, measurements of anti-M. pneumoniae and antistreptolysin O antibodies were positive. DISCUSSION: Two hypotheses should be considered: the patient has either a coinfection of S. pyogenes and M. pneumoniae or a nonspecific antibody response during a severe S. pyogenes infection.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of acute osteoarticular infections in children.
AB  - AIM: To study the bacterial aetiology of acute osteoarticular infections in children and to analyse the efficiency of culture methods. METHODS: Bacteriological data of 407 cases of clinically suspected osteoarticular infections affecting 406 children hospitalized in an orthopaedic surgery department between 1999 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Bacterial cultures from clinical specimens were positive in 74 cases (18%): 38 cases of septic arthritis and 36 cases of bone infections (osteitis, osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis). The use of liquid medium bottles to grow bacteria from articular fluids increased the rate of positive cultures compared to the use of standard solid media (p = 0.0001). The most commonly recovered pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (44%) followed by Kingella kingae (14%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%). K. kingae was most frequently isolated among children under 36 mo of age (p = 0.0003), whereas S. aureus was most frequently isolated among children over 36 mo (p = 0.0015). CONCLUSION: By improving our culture method, we observed a recrudescence of isolation of K. kingae, but S. aureus remains the main pathogen isolated from osteoarticular infections in children. This finding is useful for the adaptation of a probabilistic antibiotic treatment of these infections.

AB  
TI  - Resistant microorganisms in head and neck infections.
AB  - The key pathogens most commonly associated with acute infections in the upper respiratory tract include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Antimicrobial resistance amongst these organisms to many of the commonly used agents for treatment continues to evolve. S. pneumoniae is probably the most important pathogen in the respiratory tract and antimicrobial resistance of this organism to many drugs appears to be rising. For some organisms, such as S. pyogenes, resistance to standard therapy such penicillin has not been described. For others, such as M. catarrhalis, beta-lactamase production has become the norm, with over 90% of isolates now producing this enzyme. One of the major drivers of resistance continues to be the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in the community. This is complicated by the fact that most therapy is empiric and the exact etiology of a patient's infection is not known. Despite the fact that the clinical impact of antibiotic resistance on patient outcomes is not always clear, it remains prudent to consider the issue of resistance when selecting therapy for a patient and to continue to strive for appropriate antibiotic use as a means to stem the tide of evolving resistance.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. The trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (MICs, < or =2 microg/mL for most pathogens). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. A few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. The susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. For most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. The excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Bulgaria--a synopsis from BulSTAR 2003.
AB  - We introduce Bulgarian Surveillance Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance (BulSTAR) and make the first report on surveillance data for 2003. This longitudinal surveillance programme monitors the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, upper and lower respiratory tract, urine and wound samples in the participating microbiology laboratories. Twenty eight public, 45 hospital and 6 private laboratories from all 28 counties of the Republic of Bulgaria participated in BulSTAR 2003. The total number of isolates from monitored sources during the surveillance period was 98 929. Seven microorganisms represented 72% of all isolated bacteria in BulSTAR 2003: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus-Providencia-Morganella group, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Generally the resistance of clinically significant Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria in Bulgaria was estimated to be at a medium level when compared with many other surveillance sources worldwide. A unique 32-year experiment on the population by treating all severe infections with an ampicillin/gentamicin combination resulted in twofold higher levels of resistance to amynoglycosides compared with other countries worldwide. This is due to the extremely conservative treatment schemes used in the former socialist countries, based on national directives and cheap domestic production of gentamicin and ampicillin. The forthcoming introduction of a computer network and improvements in detecting mistakes are expected to increase the sensitivity and the significance of BulSTAR surveillance system - an indispensable tool in the combat against increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Glomerulonephritis associated with acute pneumococcal pneumonia: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of post-infectious glomerulonephritis. There have been isolated case reports of nephritis following infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae. We report here the case of a 6-year-old white female who presented with blood culture-confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia associated with glomerulonephritis. Her acute renal failure improved over several days, and renal function was normal by 8 weeks post-hospitalization. This case serves to reinforce the concept that other organisms besides Streptococcus pyogenes can trigger a similar post-infectious glomerulonephritis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any child who presents with acute glomerulonephritis and respiratory findings. Additionally, pneumococcus group 7 may be a nephritogenic strain and requires further investigation.
TI  - Enhanced efficacy of single-dose versus multi-dose azithromycin regimens in preclinical infection models.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As a result of the prolonged half-life and unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characteristics of azithromycin, shorter dosing regimens are being evaluated for the treatment of community-acquired infections. To provide further support for a shorter dosing regimen, the efficacy of azithromycin was determined in preclinical infection models comparing single- versus multi-dose regimens. METHODS: The efficacy of single versus multi-dose regimens of azithromycin was compared in mouse pneumonia, acute peritonitis, and neutropenic thigh infection models and in a gerbil model of Haemophilus influenzae acute otitis media. Azithromycin was administered as a single oral dose on the first treatment day, or as two divided doses over 2 treatment days, or as three divided doses over 3 treatment days. The pharmacokinetics of azithromycin was profiled following single and multi-dose regimens with the single dose data fit to an Emax model to characterize the PK-PD of azithromycin. RESULTS: In the mouse efficacy models, administration of single-dose azithromycin produced superior rates of survival and bacterial clearance compared with the same total dose divided over 2 or 3 days. In the gerbil model, a single dose sterilized the middle ear and more rapidly cleared H. influenzae. The pharmacokinetic evaluation confirmed similar total exposure (AUC) in serum and pulmonary tissue for the three regimens. Correlation of PK-PD parameters and antimicrobial efficacy confirmed a concentration-dependent and dosing-independent relationship for azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with data reported from clinical studies and indicate that a single-dose regimen would be at least as effective as the same dose administered over several days.
TI  - In vitro activities of levofloxacin and comparable agents against middle ear fluid, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal pathogens obtained from Costa Rican children with recurrent otitis media or failing other antibiotic therapy.
AB  - This study analyzes the in vitro activities of levofloxacin and other commonly used antimicrobials against middle ear fluid, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal pathogens obtained from children with otitis media at risk of having a resistant pathogen. Levofloxacin proved to be very active against these pathogens and had intermediate activity against Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Recovery of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx of otitis media-prone children and their smoking and nonsmoking parents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency of isolation of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the posterior nasopharynx of otitis media-prone (OMP) children and their smoking and nonsmoking parents to possibly explain why active and passive exposure to smoking is associated with carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in both adults and children. SETTING: Outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty OMP children and their smoking parents (smoking group) and 20 OMP children and their nonsmoking parents (nonsmoking group). INTERVENTIONS: Posterior nasopharynx cultures were taken from 20 OMP children and their smoking parents and 20 OMP children and their nonsmoking parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. RESULTS: Fourteen potential pathogens were isolated from smoking parents, and 17 were recovered from their children. Concordance in isolation of a pathogen between a parent and child was noted in 11 instances. Three potential pathogens were isolated from nonsmoking parents (P<.001 compared with the parents and children in the smoking group and children in the nonsmoking group), and 16 were recovered from their children. Bacterial interference by normal flora isolates against potential pathogens was noted in 58 instances in smoking parents and in 55 instances in their children (P<.05). Bacterial interference was noted in 129 instances in nonsmoking parents (P<.05 compared with the parents and children in the smoking group and children in the nonsmoking group) and in 55 instances in their children. CONCLUSIONS: A high recovery rate of potential pathogens and a low number of interfering organisms were observed in OMP children. This was not related to their parents' smoking habits. The posterior nasopharynx flora of smoking parents contained more potential pathogens similar to the ones recovered from OMP children and fewer interfering organisms than nonsmoking parents.
TI  - [In vitro activity of telithromycin against community acquired respiratory pathogens].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial, that can be useful for the treatment of respiratory infections. AIM: To compare in vitro activity of telithromycin against respiratory pathogens, isolated in outpatient clinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty strains isolated from patients with respiratory infections, were studied. The strains studied were S pneumoniae, penicillin sensitive (SPNS:57); intermediate (SPNI:35), resistant (SPNR:25); S pyogenes (SP:57); H influenzae (HIN 51); M catarrhalis (MC:25) and S aureus meticillin sensitive (SAUS:30). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by broth microdilution was studied for telitrhomycin and levofloxacin in all strains. Other antimicrobials studied, but not in all strains were erythromycin, clindamycin, trimetoprim sulphamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime. RESULTS: All strains were sensible to telithromycin at a concentration -4 microg/ml. MIC 90 and its range for SPNS was 0.03 microg/ml (-0.004-0.12), for SPNI was 0.03 microg/ml (-0.004-025), for SPNR was 0.06 microg/ml (-0.004-0.25), for HIN was 2 microg/ml (0.12-4), for SP was 0.5 microg/ml (-0.004-2), for MC was 0.5 microg/ml (0.06-2) and for SAU was 0.25 microg/ml (0.06-0.25). CONCLUSIONS: All studied pathogens were sensible to telithromycin in vitro. This antimicrobial is an alternative for the treatment of community acquired respiratory infections.
TI  - Recovery of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx of smokers and nonsmokers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active smoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke are associated with colonization by some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in both adults and children. In an attempt to explain these observations, this study compared the frequency of isolation of potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that possess interfering capabilities (ie, interfering with the in vitro growth of potential pathogens) in the nasopharynx of smokers to their recovery in nonsmokers. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens for cultures were taken from 20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers. Potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. RESULTS: Fourteen potential pathogens (0.7 per patient) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 11 of the 20 smokers, and 4 (0.2 per patient) were recovered from 3 of the 20 nonsmokers (p < 0.01). In vitro bacterial interference between two aerobic (alpha-hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci) and two anaerobic species (Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species), and four potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae [non-type b], Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. Bacterial interference was noted in 61 instances against the four potential pathogens by 22 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the group of smokers, and in 155 instances by 50 isolates from the group of nonsmokers (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate for the first time that the nasopharyngeal flora of smokers contains fewer aerobic and anaerobic organisms with interfering capabilities and more potential pathogens compared with those of nonsmokers.
TI  - Patterns of macrolide resistance determinants among S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae isolates in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - In the study we characterized the macrolide sensitivity of recent clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae collected from major Saudi Arabian hospitals. Susceptibility testing was performed using standard National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methodology on 335 S. pyogenes and 350 S. pneumoniae isolates. Macrolide resistance mechanism phenotypes were identified using double-disk diffusion. All S. pyogenes were penicillin sensitive, while 6.3% were macrolide resistant, the main mechanism of which was of M phenotype (96%). Approximately 51% of S. pneumoniae were penicillin non-susceptible. Macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae accounted for 18.8%, the majority of which were M phenotype (91%). Low-level resistance mediated by mef-bearing strains pre-dominated. Newer macrolides, including azithromycin, are still considered drugs of choice for empirical treatment of respiratory infection in such circumstances.
TI  - Streptococcal otitis media: from epidemiology to pathogenesis.
AB  
TI  - Acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pyogenes in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A beta -hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS), is an important causative agent of bacterial pharyngotonsillititis and skin, soft-tissue, and invasive infections. Although it is also an important pathogen in acute otitis media (AOM), its exact role has not been determined. METHODS: Patients aged 0-18 years with AOM, from whom a specimen of middle-ear fluid was obtained and cultured during 1999-2003, were enrolled. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and GAS were considered pathogens. Information collected included demographic characteristics, clinical history, and signs and symptoms. RESULTS: GAS otitis was observed in 350 (3.1%) of 11,311 episodes (of which 117 were also culture-positive for other pathogens). The other 10,961 episodes involved H. influenzae only (n = 2507), S. pneumoniae only (n = 2131), dual infection with H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae (n = 1290), M. catarrhalis only (n = 129), and other combinations of pathogens (n = 271). Increased age and Jewish ethnicity were independent, significant, positive risk factors for GAS AOM, and fall season was a negative risk factor. Episodes of GAS infection were less frequently bilateral, febrile, and accompanied by other systemic findings than were other episodes of other types of infection. Most patients with GAS AOM presented with acute drainage from the ears. A lower proportion of cases of AOM were due to GAS in children with recurrent AOM and in patients recently treated with antibiotics, compared with patients with AOM who did not have these factors. The risk for mastoiditis was highest among patients with GAS AOM, compared with patients infected with other pathogens: 11.6 episodes per 1000 episodes of GAS AOM, compared with 2.2, 0.3, and 0 episodes of mastoiditis per 1000 episodes of AOM due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with AOM caused by pathogens other than GAS, GAS AOM is characterized by older age and higher local aggressiveness manifested by lower rates of fever and respiratory symptoms and higher rates of tympanic perforation and mastoiditis.

AB  
TI  - Analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in a Japanese hospital.
AB  - Prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (TC(R)) genes--tet(L), tet(M), tet(K), tet(O), tet(S), tet(T), and tet(U)--which are known to be distributed to gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 Enterococcus faecalis and 46 Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a Japanese hospital. Any of the TC(R) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. The tet(M) was detected at highest rates in both E. faecalis (75.0%) and E. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(L), which was harbored in 6.7% of E. faecalis isolates and 30.4% of E. faecium isolates. The tet(O), tet(S), and tet(T) were detected in E. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(M), while tet(K) and tet(U) were not detected. Nucleotide sequences of tet(S) from E. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in Listeria monocytogenes. Sequences of tet(O) from two E. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. The tet(T), which had been reported only in Streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five E. faecalis strains. Sequence of the enterococcal tet(T) differed from that of S. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). Enterococcal strains with any one TC(R) gene or those with two TC(R) genes showed generally similar MICs of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance level was observed.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - [Pleural empyema in children: Montpellier's experience].
AB  - OBJECTIVES AND METHOD: To assess the management of pleural empyema in pediatric from a medical and surgical experience and a review of the literature. STUDY: Fifty-eight cases were reviewed from January 98 to December 2003. 62.6% have already received antibiotherapy. Forty-three percent of cases were less than three years old. Initial cultures identified Streptococcus pneumoniae in 39%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 5.6%, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in only one case and were negative in 47%. A primitive or second-line thoracoscopy were used for drainage in two-third of the cases and mainly 6.95 days after admission. Located pleural empyema and major collected volume were the main indications for thoracoscopy. Three cases have been converted into open thoracotomy. One death occurred in an immunocompromised child. All patients were well at last follow-up. DISCUSSION: The frequency of parapneumonic empyema has increased since ten years. Progress of echography and endoscopy changed their management. Antibiotics have to be effective against pneumococcal infection. Chest tube drainage is necessary to assure the lung reexpansion in case of fibropurulent collection. The difficulty is to optimise the time of video-assisted thoracoscopy (VAT) using predictive criteria as loculations and pneumatoceles. VAT allowed the aspiration of pleural fluid and removing of fibrinous loculations. Moreover VAT achieved optimal adhesiolysis and the irrigation or decortication of the pleural cavity. VAT minimized duration of stay, of chest tube drainage and the indications of thoracotomy.
TI  - Impact of carbon dioxide on the susceptibility of key respiratory tract pathogens to telithromycin and azithromycin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the quantitative differences in telithromycin and azithromycin MIC values against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes obtained using two recommended and commonly used methodologies: CLSI reference standard broth microdilution in ambient air and Etest((R)) concentration gradient in CO(2). METHODS: Four hundred clinical isolates (S. pneumoniae, n = 200; H. influenzae, n = 100; S. pyogenes, n = 100) were evaluated in seven independent laboratories. Telithromycin and azithromycin MICs were determined using CLSI broth microdilution panels incubated in ambient air and Etest strips incubated in CO(2). Standard quality control reference strains-S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (n = 10) and H. influenzae ATCC 49247 (n = 10)-were also tested. RESULTS: Telithromycin and azithromycin Etest MICs in CO(2) were elevated for all organisms when compared with values obtained using broth microdilution in ambient air. Telithromycin geometric mean MIC values increased in CO(2) by 2.05, 1.00 and 1.78 log(2) dilutions for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. pyogenes, respectively. The corresponding values for azithromycin were 2.54, 1.21 and 3.0 log(2) dilutions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Telithromycin MICs measured using Etest in CO(2) are consistently elevated compared with those generated by CLSI broth microdilution measured in ambient air. These findings indicate that Etest should not be routinely used for the determination of telithromycin MICs against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. pyogenes, unless appropriate corrective factors are applied before reporting MICs or applying interpretive susceptibilities. Based on results from this study, Etest MIC breakpoints and quality control ranges are proposed.
TI  - Geographical and ecological analysis of resistance, coresistance, and coupled resistance to antimicrobials in respiratory pathogenic bacteria in Spain.
AB  - A multicenter susceptibility surveillance (the S.A.U.C.E. project) including 2,721 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3,174 Streptococcus pyogenes, and 2,645 Haemophilus influenzae consecutive isolates was carried out in 25 hospitals all over Spain from November 2001 to October 2002 to evaluate the current epidemiology of resistance of the main bacteria involved in community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was performed in a single centralized laboratory by a broth microdilution method. The prevalence of resistant S. pneumoniae strains was 0.4% for cefotaxime, 4.4% for amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 25.6% for cefuroxime-axetil, 34.5% for erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, and 36.0% for cefaclor. Phenotypes of resistance to erythromycin were MLS(B) (macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B) in 89.9% (gene ermB) and M (macrolide) in 9.7% of cases (gene mefA). No strain harbored both genes simultaneously. Serotypes 19, 6, 23, 14, and 3 were the most prevalent, accounting for 54.6% of the total isolates. Resistance to macrolides seems to be the most alarming point, since among penicillin-susceptible isolates it reached 15.1% compared to 55.8% among penicillin-resistant strains. Geographically, a number of regions had rates of erythromycin resistance above 40% (even higher in children). Resistance to erythromycin was also high in S. pyogenes isolates: mean regional 33.2%, beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae were 20%, whereas 4.4% had a beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant phenotype. We highlight the importance of different geographical frequencies of coresistance (associations of resistance to different drugs within the same species) and coupled resistance (association of resistance between different species) probably resulting from different local coselective events.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  - The susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (FQs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in Japan during 2002. Methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobactericeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to FQs. The rate of FQs-resistant MRSA was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of FQs-resistant MSSA. The FQs-resistance rate of MRCNS was also higher than that of MSCNS, however, it was lower than that of MRSA. No FQs-resistant clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. Thirteen of Escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of Klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of Proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), furthermore 6 of 13 in E. coli, 1 of 8 in K. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 ESBL-producing isolates, and in P. mirabilis were FQs resistant. Attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of ESBL in relation to FQs resistance. The rate of FQs-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (RTI) were resistant. IMP-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of P. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of S. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of Acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or S. aureus was not found.
TI  - The Use of Macrolides in Treatment of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem among upper respiratory tract pathogens. Resistance to beta-lactam drugs among Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes is increasing. As safe and well-tolerated antibiotics, macrolides play a key role in the treatment of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Their broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive cocci, such as S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, atypical pathogens, H. influenzae (azithromycin and clarithromycin), and Moraxella catarrhalis, has led to the widespread use of macrolides for empiric treatment of upper RTIs and as alternatives for patients allergic to b-lactams. Macrolide resistance is increasing among pneumococci and recently among S. pyogenes, and is associated with increasing use of the newer macrolides, such as azithromycin. Ribosomal target modification mediated by erm(A) and erm(B) genes and active efflux due to mef(A) and mef(E) are the principal mechanisms of resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Recently, ribosomal protein and RNA mutations have been found responsible for acquired resistance to macrolides in S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae. Although macrolides are only weakly active against macrolide-resistant streptococci species producing an efflux pump (mef) and are inactive against pathogens with ribosomal target modification (erm), treatment failures are uncommon. Therefore, macrolide therapy, for now, remains a good alternative for treatment of upper RTIs; however, continuous monitoring of the local resistance patterns is essential.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of potential bacterial pathogens in adults with acute respiratory tract infections Prospective Epidemiological Network Investigating Community-acquired Infection SurveiLLance In Nagasaki (PENICILLIN) Study.
AB  - The prevalence and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens in acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTIs) is not clear. We conducted a prospective community-based multicenter study in 45 centers across Nagasaki, Japan, between December 2001 and April 2002. We examined the nasopharyngeal or throat isolates in 930 adult outpatients with AURTIs. Potential bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes (from 6.8% patients), S. pneumoniae (5.3%), S. milleri group (2.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (26.0%), Moraxella catarrhalis (7.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (17.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.2%), were isolated from 51.8% of the patients. Penicillin nonsusceptible phenotype accounted for 44.9% of S. pneumoniae isolates. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 9.1% were methicillin-resistant. In H. influenzae isolates, 6.7% produced beta-lactamase and 23.2% were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant. The results indicated that the potential bacterial pathogens were detected in the remarkable population of the adults with AURTIs and the current antimicrobial susceptibilities of such pathogens.
TI  - Cefdinir: an oral alternative to parenteral cephems.
AB  - Cost savings are possible if oral cephems of equivalent efficacy can be substituted for parenteral cephems. An in vitro study was performed to compare the activity of cefdinir, cefoxitin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against 243 clinical isolates of human pathogens. Activities were determined by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards microbroth dilution methodology using an inoculum of approximately 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL. Cefdinir was the single or equally most potent agent against Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that produced a variety of beta-lactamase types. Cefdinir was less potent than ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Haemophilus influenzae, but was 2- to 8-fold more potent than cefoxitin and 8- to 32-fold more potent than cefazolin. Cefdinir was slightly less potent than ceftazidime, against beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella catarrhalis. These data support clinical consideration of cefdinir as an alternative to parenteral cephems in infections where adequate tissue levels can be safely assured.
TI  - Intrinsic reduced susceptibility of serotype 6 Streptococcus pyogenes to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolone resistance is common in Staphylococcus aureus, is increasing in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and is reported in Streptococcus pyogenes. METHODS: We surveyed 384 clinical isolates of S. pyogenes, isolated during 2002-2003, for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. We performed nucleotide sequencing of the parC and gyrA genes and determined the M/emm type for selected isolates. Additionally, we analyzed M/emm type 6 S. pyogenes isolated during 1918-2003 from diverse locations. RESULTS: Of the survey isolates, 10.9% had reduced zones of inhibition to ciprofloxacin in the disk-diffusion test and had elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations to other fluoroquinolones, compared with those of fully susceptible isolates. Of the resistant isolates, 90.5% were M/emm type 6, and all sequenced M/emm type 6 isolates contained a serine-to-alanine substitution at position 79 in parC. Strikingly, the same findings were also present in macrolide-resistant isolates from a recent outbreak of S. pyogenes infection in Pittsburgh and in the Lancefield reference strain of M type 6, which was isolated in 1918, decades before the development of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. CONCLUSION: M/emm type 6 S. pyogenes has intrinsic reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, as a result of a polymorphism in parC. This finding was also demonstrated in erythromycin-resistant M/emm type 6 S. pyogenes, which raises concern for the emergence of multidrug-resistant S. pyogenes.
TI  - Meta-analysis of bacterial resistance to macrolides.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Understanding changing resistance patterns is important in determining appropriate antibiotic treatments. This meta-analysis systematically evaluated resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes to macrolide antibiotics among patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched and experts were consulted to identify published and unpublished literature reporting macrolide resistance rates. Identified studies were evaluated by two independent reviewers; those meeting a priori specified criteria (resistance by patient condition and strain, resistance thresholds, 1997-2003 isolates) were included. Data from included studies were abstracted by two independent reviewers using a standard review form. Discrepancies in abstracted data were resolved by the study investigator. RESULTS: Random-effects meta-analysis was performed for outcomes present in at least four studies overall and for specified subgroups. We identified 3849 studies and performed detailed review on 407; of these 29, published between 1998-2003, met the inclusion criteria. Mean resistance of S. pneumoniae isolates to azithromycin was 27.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 24.6-29.7]; mean resistance to erythromycin was statistically equivalent (30.4%; 95% CI 28.1-32.7). Resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin (30.0%; CI 18.6-41.5) was similar to that of S. pneumoniae. Too few studies of clarithromycin were included to allow evaluation of resistance. In subgroup analyses, substantial variation in resistance to erythromycin was seen by geographic area. CONCLUSIONS: Reported macrolide resistance of S. pneumoniae varies substantially and may be a significant issue in certain regions. Use of meta-analysis to aggregate individual studies enabled determination of robust values for macrolide resistance. This information is useful for clinical and policy decision makers in developing appropriate antibiotic strategies.
TI  - Augmentation of the bactericidal activities of human cathelicidin CAP18/LL-37-derived antimicrobial peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such as defensins and cathelicidins) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading micro-organisms. Among these, human cathelicidin CAP18/LL-37 (L1-S37) possesses potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, to develop peptide derivatives with improved bactericidal actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (K15-V32) of LL-37 as a template, and evaluated the activities of modified peptides. METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the peptides (0.022 approximately 4.4 microM corresponding to 0.1 approximately 10 microg/ml) were assessed by alamarBlue assay using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as target organisms. Furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities of the peptides were examined by using E. coli ML-35p as a target. RESULTS: By substituting E16 and K25 with two L residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (18-mer LL) was increased, and by further substituting Q22, D26 and N30 with three K residues, the cationicity of the peptide (18-mer LLKKK) was enhanced. Among peptide derivatives, 18-mer LLKKK exhibited the most potent antibacterial actions against S. aureus (methicillin-resistant and -sensitive), S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and possessed the most powerful membrane-permeabilizing activities against E. coli ML-35p at the effective concentrations (p <0.05, 18-mer LLKKK vs. 18-mer LL, 18-mer K15-V32 and LL-37). CONCLUSIONS: Bactericidal activities of the amphipathic human CAP18/LL-37-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and cationicity, and 18-mer LLKKK is the most potent among peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Pneumonia outbreak associated with group a Streptococcus species at a military training facility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although group A streptococci (GAS) infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, outbreaks of associated pneumonia are rare. We report an outbreak of GAS pneumonia that occurred at a US military training camp. METHODS: Standard epidemiologic and laboratory procedures were used to characterize the outbreak and causative organism(s). A case-control study and determination of the prevalence of GAS infection among camp personnel were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 162 of 4500 Marine Corps personnel were hospitalized for respiratory symptoms during the period of 1 November and 20 December 2002, and 127 (78%) had radiographically confirmed pneumonia. The attack rate was 1.6 cases per 100 person-months. Thirty-four (27%) of 127 patients with pneumonitis had definite or probable GAS pneumonia; an additional 22 (17.3%) were coinfected with GAS and another pathogen. Pathogens, in addition to GAS, included Chlamydia pneumoniae (27 patients), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (19), adenovirus (5), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2). A survey revealed that the pharyngeal carriage rate of GAS among camp personnel was 16%. Molecular characterization of the GAS isolates found emm type 3, multilocus sequence type 15. The epidemic ended after administration of additional prophylaxis with a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin (1.2 million U) or azithromycin (1 g orally). Because the number of days from the last penicillin injection was correlated with a positive throat culture result and the occurrence of pneumonia, the dosing interval of benzathine penicillin was shortened from every 28-35 days to every 21 days. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest outbreak of GAS pneumonia reported in >30 years. This outbreak emphasizes the potential for GAS to cause epidemics of severe infection and demonstrates the need for surveillance and consideration of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis among particularly high-risk populations.
TI  - A randomized, multicenter, double blind, double dummy trial of single dose azithromycin versus high dose amoxicillin for treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High dose amoxicillin is recommended for the initial treatment of children with acute otitis media (AOM), particularly patients at risk for having drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Single dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) is considered an alternative agent for the treatment of AOM. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of single dose azithromycin with that of high dose amoxicillin among children with uncomplicated AOM. METHODS: This was a double blind, double dummy, multinational, clinical trial in which children (6-30 months of age) with AOM were randomized to treatment with single dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) or high dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d, in 2 divided doses) for 10 days. Tympanocentesis was performed at baseline and clinical responses were assessed at days 12-14 (end of therapy) and at days 25-28 (end of study). RESULTS: The study enrolled 313 patients, and 83% of the patients were < or =2 years of age. A total of 158 patients in the azithromycin group and 154 in the amoxicillin group were considered clinical modified intent-to-treat patients. A middle ear pathogen was detected for 212 patients (68%). Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen (isolated for 96 patients), followed by S. pneumoniae (92 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (23 patients) and Streptococcus pyogenes (23 patients). beta-Lactamase production was observed for 17% of H. influenzae isolates and 100% of M. catarrhalis isolates. Thirty-five (38%) S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-nonsusceptible and 24 (26%) isolates were macrolide-resistant. At the end of therapy, clinical success rates for azithromycin and amoxicillin were comparable for all patients (84 and 84%, respectively) and for children < or =2 years of age (82 and 82%, respectively). At the end of therapy and end of study, clinical efficacies among all microbiologic modified intent-to-treat evaluable subjects were comparable for patients treated with azithromycin (80%) and patients treated with amoxicillin (83%). The rates of treatment-related adverse events for azithromycin and amoxicillin were 20% and 29%, respectively (P = 0.064). Diarrhea was more common in the amoxicillin group than in the azithromycin group (17.5 and 8.2%, respectively) (P = 0.017). Compliance, defined as completion of > or =80% of the study medication, was higher in the azithromycin group (100%) than in the amoxicillin group (90%) (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, single dose azithromycin was as effective as high dose amoxicillin for the treatment of children with AOM, whereas rates of adverse events were lower and compliance improved with the simplified single dose regimen.

TI  - [Differentiation of resistance phenotypes among erythromycin-resistant streptococci].
AB  - Although macrolide antibiotics have proved to be a valuable alternative to beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, resistance to these agents is now becoming established in streptococci, especially among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Of particular concern is the emergence of cross-resistance to 14-, 15- and 16-membered macrolides, licosamides and group B streptogramins (MLSb phenotype). MLS resistance can be expressed either constitutively (cMLS phenotype) or inducibly (iMLS phenotype). MLS resistance is mediated by two classes of methylase genes--the conventional erm(B) and recently described erm(A) determinants. A new macrolide efflux mechanism has been described for streptococci, in which it is associated with a new resistance pattern (M phenotype) characterized by resistance to 14- and 15-membered macrolides, and susceptibility to 16-membered macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B. The recognition of the prevalence of M phenotype in streptococci has implications for sensitivity testing and may have an impact on the choice of antibiotic therapy in clinical practice. While M resistance is similar in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae being mediated by mef(A) and mef(E), respectively, MLS resistance in both species appears to be genotypically and phenotypically more varied. Differentiation of M and MLS phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant strains can be performed using the erythromycin-clindamycin double-disc method (ECDD). Distinguishing not only M resistance but also constitutively or inducibly MLS phenotype by ECDD in S. pyogenes is easily and reliably achieved. Inducible MLS phenotype S. pyogenes strain is genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous and is further subdivided into three recently described subtypes, iMLS-A, iMLS-B and iMLS-C, by a triple-disk test with erythromycin plus clindamycin and josamycin. While distinguishing M from MLS resistance in S. pneumoniae by ECDD test is easily and reliably achieved, the differentiation between constitutive and inducible MLS resistance is by far more uncertain. The meaning of inducible MLS resistance appears to be different in S. pneumoniae from that in S. pyogenes. In order to easily differentiate, within erythromycin-resistant pneumococci, not only the strains of the M phenotype from those with MLS resistance but also among the latter, cMLS from iMcLS strains, a triple-disk test has been set up by adding a rokitamycin disk to the conventional
TI  - Distribution of subclasses mefA and mefE of the mefA gene among clinical isolates of macrolide-resistant (M-phenotype) Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The distribution of subclasses mefA and mefE of the mefA gene among 116 M-phenotype streptococci was as follows: pneumococci (38 strains had mefE and 4 mefA), viridans streptococci (49 mefE and 1 mefA), and Streptococcus pyogenes (24 mefA). Spain(9V)-3-14 and England(14)-9 clones of serotype 14 were dominant among pneumococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and group A beta-haemolytic streptococci in 2002-2003. Results of the multinational GRASP Surveillance Program.
AB  - A multinational surveillance study, GRASP, was conducted between November 2002 and April 2003 with the aim of assessing rates of antimicrobial resistance among 2656 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2486 isolates of group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, 1358 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and 1047 of Moraxella catarrhalis from 20 countries in Europe, eastern Asia and southern Africa. Conspicuous differences between various countries were noted in the S. pneumoniae resistance rates observed for penicillin (0-79.2%) and erythromycin (4-66%), along with other antimicrobials. The percentage of MDR strains was above 25% in 8 of the 20 countries studied. Group A streptococcal macrolide resistance rates ranged from 0% to 35% by country, while rates of beta-lactamase production ranged from 0% to 39% for H. influenzae and 80-100% for M. catarrhalis. Antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae remains a significant problem world wide.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - Detection and quantification of macrolide resistance mutations at positions 2058  and 2059 of the 23S rRNA gene by pyrosequencing.
AB  - A pyrosequencing method for detection and quantification of macrolide resistance  mutations at positions 2058 and 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 23S rRNA gene is described. The method was developed and tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium avium, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - PROTEKT 1999-2000: a multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens in Japan.
AB  - DESIGN: A six-centre study in Japan during the winter of 1999-2000 assessed the in vitro activity of >20 antimicrobial agents against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each antimicrobial was determined against these isolates using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methodology. RESULTS: Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 44.5% were penicillin resistant. The macrolide resistance rate was 77.9% with 90.5% of penicillin-resistant strains also being macrolide resistant. Resistance mechanisms in macrolide-resistant isolates were identified as mef(A) or erm(B) in 42.5% and 52.5%, respectively. Of the fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (1.3%), most were also penicillin and macrolide resistant. All strains were inhibited by telithromycin at <or=1mg/L. Among S. pyogenes isolates, erythromycin resistance was 17.5% overall but showed considerable variation among the six centres. For H. influenzae, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and a single beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant isolate (0.36%) was obtained, and there was no fluoroquinolone resistance. All isolates were susceptible to telithromycin. Most antimicrobials showed good activity against M. catarrhalis, although 96.7% were beta-lactamase positive. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to macrolides, penicillin and the fluoroquinolones among the common respiratory pathogens is high in Japan.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx of healthy  school children in Turkey.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Information on oropharyngeal carriage rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis and their resistance pattern in healthy school children in Turkey is lacking. The present study was undertaken to determine the carriage rates and antimicrobial resistance of these bacterial pathogens in such children aged 6-14 yr in Manisa, Turkey. METHODS: A total of 1022 children were included from nine schools selected randomly from 32 schools. Throat swabs were cultured for bacteria which were identified using standard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined as per National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 1022 children 240 (23.4%) harboured S. pneumoniae, 162 (15.8%) H. influenzae, 30 (2.9%) S. pyogenes and 82 (8%) M. catarrhalis in their oropharynx. For S. pneumoniae overall 17.9 per cent of the isolates were intermediately and 7 per cent were resistant to penicillin and resistance to erythromycin trimethoprim-sulphamethoxasole (TMP/SMX), and chloramphenicol was 13.7, 9.1 and 1.6 per cent, respectively. Ampicillin resistance observed in 20.9 per cent of H. influenzae isolates was associated with the presence of beta-lactamase, except two isolates interpreted as beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistant strains. Resistance of H. influenzae to TMP/SMX, chloramphenicol, azithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was 14.2, 2.4, 1.8, 1.2 and 1.2 per cent, respectively. M.catarrhalis isolates produced beta-lactamase in 80.5 per cent of the cases and all were susceptible to macrolides and clavulanic acid/amoxicillin combination; the highest rate of resistance of 17 per cent was for TMP/SMX. One (3.3%) isolate of S. pyogenes was resistant to macrolides tested. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our data shows that upper respiratory tract of about 50 per cent children was colonized with respiratory pathogens. There is a need for surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage of resistant strains in healthy school children.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in the nasopharyngeal flora of children with acute otitis media and otitis media recurring after amoxicillin therapy.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms isolated from the nasopharynx of children who presented with acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin therapy. Nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 72 patients, 40 with AOM and 32 with recurrent otitis media (ROM), were analysed. Thirty-six potentially pathogenic organisms were recovered in 34 (85 %) of the children from the AOM group, and 42 were isolated from 29 (91 %) of the children from the ROM group. The organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (n = 22), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 13), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 8) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9). Resistance to the eight antimicrobial agents used was found in 37 instances in the AOM group as compared to 99 instances in the ROM group (P < 0.005). The difference between AOM and ROM was significant with Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to amoxicillin (P < 0.005), to amoxicillin/clavulanate (P < 0.005), to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P < 0.01), to cefixime (P < 0.01) and to azithromycin (P < 0.01), and for H. influenzae resistance to amoxicillin (P < 0.025). These data illustrate the higher recovery rate of antimicrobial-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae from the nasopharynx of children who had otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin therapy than those with AOM.
TI  - Micromachined polymerase chain reaction system for multiple DNA amplification of  upper respiratory tract infectious diseases.
AB  - This paper presents a micro polymerase chain reaction (PCR) chip for the DNA-based diagnosis of microorganism genes and the detection of their corresponding antibiotic-resistant genes. The micro PCR chip comprises cheap biocompatible soda-lime glass substrates with integrated thin-film platinum resistors as heating/sensing elements, and is fabricated using micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) techniques in a reliable batch-fabrication process. The heating and temperature sensing elements are made of the same material and are located inside the reaction chamber in order to ensure a uniform temperature distribution. This study performs the detection of several genes associated with upper respiratory tract infection microorganisms, i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemopilus influenze, Staphylococcu aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Neisseria meningitides, together with their corresponding antibiotic-resistant genes. The lower thermal inertia of the proposed micro PCR chip relative to conventional bench-top PCR systems enables a more rapid detection operation with reduced sample and reagent consumption. The experimental data reveal that the high heating and cooling rates of the system (20 and 10 degrees C/s, respectively) permit successful DNA amplification within 15 min. The micro PCR chip is also capable of performing multiple DNA amplification, i.e. the simultaneous duplication of multiple genes under different conditions in separate reaction wells. Compared with the large-scale PCR system, it is greatly advantageous for fast diagnosis of multiple infectious diseases. Multiplex PCR amplification of two DNA segments in the same well is also feasible using the proposed micro device. The developed micro PCR chip provides a crucial tool for genetic analysis, molecular biology, infectious disease detection, and many other biomedical applications.
TI  - Hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of extracts from Trichilia emetica Vahl. (Meliaceae).
AB  - Trichilia emetica Vahl. (Meliaceae) is a tree widely distributed in Tropical Africa. It has been used in Mali folk medicine for the treatment of various illnesses. The aim of this work was to study the hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of a crude aqueous extract from Trichilia emetica root. An ethyl ether fraction from the aqueous extract was also prepared and studied. We have examined the hepatoprotective activity of the extracts on CCl4-induced damage in rat hepatocytes, their toxicity using the brine shrimp bioassay and their antibacterial activity against clinical isolated bacterial strains, which are commonly responsible for respiratory infections. A preliminary phytochemical analysis showed a high polyphenolic content in the aqueous extract and the presence of limonoids in the ethyl ether fraction. These latter compounds may be considered responsible for the good activity against the bacterial strains tested. Trichilia emetica extracts exerted also a significant (P<0.05) hepatoprotective effect at a dose of 1000 microg/ml both on plasma membrane and mitochondrial function as compared to silymarin used as a positive control. These activities may be a result of the presence of either polyphenols or limonoids. Finally, both the aqueous extract and its ethyl ether fraction did not show toxicity (LC50>1000 microg/ml) in the brine shrimp bioassay.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Achillea clavennae essential oil against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The essential oil of Achillea clavennae was investigated for its antibacterial activity against some respiratory tract pathogens. Maximum activity was observed against Klebsiella pneumoniae and penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil also exhibited strong activity against Gram (-) Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram (+) Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant to the oil.
TI  - Effect of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin and cefprozil on bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in the adenoids.
AB  - To compare the effects on the bacterial flora of the adenoids of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin or cefprozil, we enrolled in a prospective randomized study 60 children scheduled for elective adenoidectomy because of recurrent otitis media. They were randomized before surgery into 3 groups of 20 patients each: a no-therapy group, and groups with 10 days of either amoxicillin or cefprozil therapy. Core adenoid materials were quantitatively cultured for aerobic and facultative bacteria. The in vitro ability of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (AHS) to inhibit the growth of non-type B Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined. The number of organisms in adenoids obtained from patients treated with either antibiotic was reduced as compared to that in adenoids from controls. However, in patients treated with amoxicillin, a significant decline in the number of AHS, and an increase (in Staphylococcus aureus) or no change in the number of other beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) was noted. In contrast, in those treated with cefprozil, no change was noted in the frequency of recovery of AHS, and the number of BLPB decreased. Interfering AHS were more often recovered in patients treated with cefprozil. We conclude that the adenoids contain more interfering AHS after therapy with a second-generation oral cephalosporin (cefprozil) than after amoxicillin therapy. This study suggests a potential beneficial effect of using an antimicrobial that selectively spares interfering AHS while inhibiting BLPB.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a pharmacokinetically enhanced oral formulation  of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2000/125 mg twice daily) against 9172 respiratory isolates collected worldwide in 2000.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A new, pharmacokinetically enhanced, oral formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been developed to overcome resistance in the major bacterial respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, while maintaining excellent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase producing strains. This study was conducted to provide in vitro susceptibility data for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 16 comparator agents against the key respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: Susceptibility testing was performed on 9172 isolates collected from 95 centers in North America, Europe, Australia, and Hong Kong by broth microdilution MIC determination, according to NCCLS methods, using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 16 comparator antimicrobial agents. Results were interpreted according to NCCLS breakpoints and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) breakpoints based on oral dosing regimens. RESULTS: Overall, 93.5% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid at the current susceptible breakpoint of < or =2 microg/mL and 97.3% at the PK/PD susceptible breakpoint of < or =4 microg/mL for the extended release formulation. Proportions of isolates that were penicillin intermediate and resistant were 13% and 16.5%, respectively, while 25% were macrolide resistant and 21.8% trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant. 21.9% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers and 16.8% trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant, >99% of isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefixime, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin at NCCLS breakpoints. The most active agents against Moraxella catarrhalis were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, macrolides, cefixime, fluoroquinolones, and doxycycline. Overall, 13% of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to macrolides. CONCLUSION: The extended release formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has potential for empiric use against many respiratory tract infections worldwide due to its activity against species resistant to many agents currently in use.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in infancy: the Soroka experience: 1990-2000.
AB  - Acute mastoiditis (AM) is an uncommon but serious complication of acute otitis media (AOM). In the pre-antibiotic era, AM was seen more frequently than it is today, but it was rare in infants. However, in the last two decades an increase in the incidence of AM in infancy has been reported in the literature. During the years 1990-2002, we treated 113 patients with 128 episodes of AM; of them, 24 were infants (median age 6 months; 18 males) who suffered from 26 episodes of AM. Twenty developed AM as a complication of their first episode of AOM. One of the four infants with a prior history of AOM suffered from common variable immunodeficiency. A significant increase in the incidence of AM in infants was recorded during the study period (P = 0.01). The most common presenting clinical signs were post-auricular swelling and fever >38 degrees C (77% and 77%, respectively, of all patients). Seventeen episodes of AM were not treated with prior antibiotics. Tympanocentesis was performed in all episodes of AM. Middle ear fluid culture was positive in 17 (65%) of the 26 AM episodes. The most common pathogens cultured were Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 infants, 58% of all pathogens, 3/10 intermediately susceptible to penicillin) followed by Streptococcus pyogenes (4, 23%), non-typable H. influenzae (2, 12%) and S. aureus (1, 6%). Temporal bone CT showed bone destruction in 14 patients; 3 infants had subperiosteal abscesses and 3 lateral sinus thrombosis. Ten infants underwent mastoid surgery due to non-resolution of symptoms and signs with antibiotic therapy. Eight underwent cortical mastoidectomy with two patients undergoing ventilation tube introduction only. The remainder of the infants healed with conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: (1) A significant increase in the incidence of AM in infants was recorded over the last decade, though a specific reason for this trend remains uncertain; (2) Most of the cases of AM followed the infant's initial AOM episode, and most of the infants had not received prior antibiotic therapy; (3) The clinical signs and symptoms of AM were more severe in infants than in older patients; (4) While S. pneumonia was the most common pathogen isolated in middle ear fluid cultures, the involvement of S. pyogenes in AM was higher than that reported in AOM.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against selected respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of ertapenem was evaluated in comparison to 21  selected agents against a large collection of recently isolated respiratory tract pathogens including: 180 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 Streptococcus pyogenes, 70 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 100 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae. Additional in vitro tests (time-kill curves with ertapenem alone and in combination with four other agents) for S. pneumoniae were carried out. METHODS: MIC determinations and time-kill curves were carried out following the procedures suggested by the NCCLS. RESULTS: According to NCCLS susceptibility breakpoints, ertapenem was comparable to the most potent compounds tested for all pathogens studied. Ertapenem was 100% active against penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate S. pneumoniae and against 60% of penicillin-resistant strains. Time-kill tests at 4x MIC confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of ertapenem against these organisms. Interactions of ertapenem with several other agents against pneumococci resulted in clear synergic interactions (98.4%). Indifference was extremely rare and antagonism was not observed. All S. pyogenes strains tested were inhibited by ertapenem, irrespective of their macrolide resistance phenotypes. Ertapenem was also fully active against H. influenzae (100% susceptible) and M. catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-0.03 mg/L) even when capable of synthesizing beta-lactamases. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, were 100% susceptible to ertapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ertapenem has a suitable spectrum of activity against organisms encountered in community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Bacterial capsular polysaccharide and sugar transferases.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides (CPs) of several pathogenic bacteria are thought to be good materials for the development of new therapeutic reagents. These polysaccharides can be used as vaccines against infection of pathogenic bacteria and are also useful as inhibitors for disease caused by aberrant and abnormal cell-cell interaction, such as cancer metastasis and inflammation. Since bacterial CPs are diverse in structure and these bacteria have a variety of sugar transferases responsible for the synthesis of CPs, bacterial CP synthesis (cps) genes have attracted much interest as a source of glycosyltransferases useful for glycoengineering. In this review, we describe physiological effects of the bacterial CPs on mammalian cells, and the structure and function of the cps genes, by focusing on group B streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia and Ib, that produce high-molecular weight polysaccharides consisting of the following pentasaccharide repeating units: -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1--> and -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)beta-D-Glcp-(1-->, respectively.
TI  - An examination of the differential sensitivity to ketolide antibiotics in ermB strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Several reports in the literature have described a differential sensitivity to ketolide antibiotics in ermB strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to erythromycin. Strains of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae carrying different erm gene alleles were examined for their susceptibility to the ketolide antibiotics cethromycin (ABT-773) and telithromycin. The effect of the antibiotics on cell growth and viability was assessed as were effects on protein synthesis and 50S ribosomal subunit formation. The susceptibility of wild-type strains of both organisms was compared with effects in strains containing the ermA and ermB methyltransferase genes. A wild-type antibiotic-susceptible strain of S. pyogenes was comparable to an ermA strain of the organism in its ketolide sensitivity, with IC(50) values for 50% inhibition of protein synthesis and 50S ribosomal subunit formation of 10 ng/mL for cethromycin and 16 ng/mL for telithromycin. An S. pneumoniae strain with the ermB gene and an S. pyogenes strain with the ermA gene were also similar in their sensitivity to ketolide inhibition. IC(50) values for inhibition of translation and subunit formation in S. pneumoniae ( ermB) were 30 ng/mL and 55 ng/mL and for the ermA strain of S. pyogenes they were 15 ng/mL and 35 ng/mL respectively. By contrast, an S. pyogenes ermB strain was significantly more resistant to both ketolides, with IC(50) values for inhibition of 50S synthesis of 215 and 380 ng/mL for the two ketolides. Experiments were conducted to examine ribosome synthesis and translational activity in the two ermB strains at intervals during growth in the presence of each antibiotic. Cell viability and 50S subunit formation were dramatically reduced in the S. pneumoniae strain during continued growth with either drug. By contrast, the ketolides had little effect on the S. pyogenes strain growing with the antibiotics. The results indicate that ketolides have a reduced inhibitory effect on translation and 50S subunit synthesis in S. pyogenes with the ermB gene compared with the other strains examined.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Respiratory infections and asthma: current treatment strategies.
AB  - Infections such as lower respiratory illness potentially contribute to the initiation of asthma and are major factors in recurring acute exacerbations of the condition. Although typical bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae do not initiate asthmatic exacerbations, data from a subgroup of adults suggest a potential role for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae in the onset of asthma. Common cold viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in young children and rhinoviruses in older children and adults, are the major causes of acute exacerbations of asthma. These exacerbations are not prevented with maintenance therapies that are used for chronic asthma, but do respond to short courses of systemic corticosteroids. There are continued attempts to produce a successful vaccine and antiviral agents for the treatment of RSV that are more effective and more practical to use than ribavirin, which is currently the only available antiviral for RSV. The prevention and treatment of rhinovirus infections have focused on the major receptor for the virus, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is located on respiratory epithelial cells. A multivalent, recombinant, antibody fusion protein identified as CFY196 has high avidity for ICAM-1 and has the potential to protect against rhinovirus infection. Another approach for preventing and treating rhinovirus infection uses a recombinant, soluble, truncated form of ICAM-1 in which the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the protein have been deleted. An initial clinical study on this agent demonstrated clinical efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of experimental rhinovirus infection in volunteers, but did not significantly prevent infection.
TI  - Development of macrolide-resistance and comparative activity of telithromycin in  streptococci in Austria, 1996-2002.
AB  - The increase detected in macrolide resistance in streptococci in various parts of the world has brought into question the usefulness of macrolides as first line therapy for respiratory tract infections. In a nationwide study, a total of 3012 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 499 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were collected from 1996 to 2002 and tested for their susceptibility to penicillin, azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin (2002 only). Penicillin-intermediate and -resistant isolates of S. pneumoniae comprised 4.9% (2.9 and 2.0%, respectively) of all isolates in 1996; macrolide resistance was also comparatively low at 3.2%. In the following years the rate of penicillin-resistant pneumococci increased steadily, reaching the 10% mark in 2002. A similar trend was recorded for the macrolides. No penicillin-resistant strain of S. pyogenes was found during the observation period. The prevalence of macrolide-resistance in S. pyogenes climbed from 4.7% in 1996 to the present rate of 7.2% (clarithromycin) and 9.4% (azithromycin). Telithromycin showed excellent activity against both S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes with 99.8 and 100% strains sensitive, respectively.
TI  - Genetic elements carrying macrolide efflux genes in streptococci.
AB  - Type M resistance to macrolides in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated to the presence of macrolide efflux genes (mef). These genes are carried by 3 very conserved chromosomal genetic elements: (i) "mega", 5.5 kb, typical of S. pneumoniae, carries mef(E), can insert at different sites in the bacterial chromosome and in other genetic elements, does not have genes encoding putative recombinases or transposases, and it is not conjugative; (ii) Tn1207.3, 54, 52 kb, typical of S. pyogenes, carries mef(A), it integrates at a single specific site in the bacterial chromosome, carries 3 ORFs encoding for putative recombinases, it is transferred by conjugation among different streptococcal species, and its genome resembles that of a bacteriophage; (iii) Tn1207.1, 7.2 kb, is a defective form of Tn1207.3 found in a clonal population of S. pneumoniae, it carries mef(A), it integrates at a single specific site in the bacterial chromosome (the same of Tn1207.3), and it is not conjugative.
TI  - Macrolide resistance from the ribosome perspective.
AB  - Macrolides are important antibiotics used in treatment of respiratory tract infections in humans. Although some of these compounds have been in use for 50 years, it has not been until the last few years that their mechanism of action and the nature of ribosomal-based resistance could be more fully understood. With the advent of robust crystals of ribosomal 50S subunits, and structural resolution of macrolides and ketolides complexed to either Haloarcula marismortui or Deinococcus radiodurans 50S, the ability to dissect the binding modes and understand resistance at the level of the ribosome became possible. This review article compares the binding features of 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides to that of ketolides telithromycin and ABT-773 as revealed at the atomistic level. Attempts to understand how modifications to 23S rRNA and/or mutations in ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 that have been found to confer resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae are told from the perspective of the ribosome.
TI  - Use of an oligonucleotide array for laboratory diagnosis of bacteria responsible  for acute upper respiratory infections.
AB  - We developed a diagnostic array of oligonucleotide probes targeting species-specific variable regions of the genes encoding topoisomerases GyrB and ParE of respiratory bacterial pathogens. Suitable broad-range primer sequences were designed based on alignment of gyrB/parE sequences from nine different bacterial species. These species included Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Specific probe sequences were selected by comparative analysis against the European Bioinformatics Database, as well as gyrB/parE sequences generated for this study. To verify specificity, at least six initial oligonucleotide probe sequences per bacterial species were tested by hybridization on a solid glass support using culture collection strains as templates. Finally, three oligonucleotide probes per bacterial species were utilized to examine 65 middle ear fluid and 29 throat swab samples. The sensitivities of the developed assay compared to classic culture from middle ear fluid samples for H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae were 96 (93 for culture), 73 (93 for culture), and 100% (78% for culture), respectively. No cross-reactivity with bacterial species belonging to the normal oral flora was observed when the 29 throat swab samples were studied. The sensitivity of the assay to detect S. pyogenes from these samples was 93% (80% for culture). These results provide a proof of concept for the diagnostic use of microarray technology based on broad-range topoisomerase gene amplification, followed by hybridization and specific detection of bacterial species.
TI  - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis to 14 oral antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data on the in vitro activities of orally administered cephalosporins, particularly third-generation cephalosporins, against recent pathogens responsible for community-respiratory tract infection are lacking. METHODS: A susceptibility surveillance of 267 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 205 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 204 of Haemophilus influenzae, and 147 of Moraxella catarrhalis to 14 oral antimicrobial agents using the agar dilution method was carried out from March 2002 to October 2002 in Taiwan. RESULTS: High rates of non-susceptibility to penicillin (60%), cefaclor (67%), cefuroxime (62%), cefpodoxime (64%), clarithromycin (91%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (98%) for S. pneumoniae isolates and high rates of non-susceptibility to ampicillin (70%), clarithromycin (34%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (63%) for H. influenzae isolates were found. The rank order of oral cephalosporin activity based on the minimum concentrations at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) for S. pneumoniae was cefpodoxime > cefuroxime > cefixime > cefaclor, cephradine > cephalexin and for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was cefixime > cefpodoxime > cefuroxime > cefaclor > cephalexin, cephradine. Among the 75 S. pneumoniae isolates resistant to penicillin (MICs ranged 2 to 4 mg/L), 4% were intermediate to amoxicillin and > 90% were resistant to cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cefpodoxime. For S. pyogenes isolates, all were susceptible to penicillin, 21% were not susceptible to clarithromycin and 4% were not susceptible to clindamycin. Thirty four percent of H. influenzae isolates were not susceptible to clarithromycin. The MIC90 of clarithromycin against M. catarrhalis isolates was 0.5 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Cefpodoxime, cefixime, and cefuroxime are promising agents against these bacterial pathogens, except for penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates.
TI  - Survival and surface adherence ability of bacterial pathogens in oral liquid pharmaceuticals and their containers.
AB  - The survival and surface adherence ability of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nutrient broth and in five oral liquid pharmaceuticals (nivaquine syrup, cough mixture, paracetamol elixir, cotrimoxazole and vitamin C) were investigated The bacteria grew more in nutrient broth than in the pharmaceuticals (p < 0. 001) and the recovery of stressed cells was enhanced when 3% Tween 80 was used as the recovery medium as against the use of normal saline (p < 0.01). The Gram-negative bacteria were more adapted to the pharmaceuticals than their Gram-positive counterparts. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were recovered in large numbers from nivaquine and cotrimoxazole suspensions that did not support the growth of the other bacteria. The effect of bacterial growth on the physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals was also evaluated The properties were not altered significantly except for pH shifts of 0.3 to 1.1 caused by E. coli and S. aureus in paracetamol and vitamin C. Adherence capability was found to correlate with the survival ability of the bacteria. Populations on coupons were significantly higher when nutrient broth was used as the suspending medium compared with any of the pharmaceuticals (p < 0.01). Rubber and plastic coupons were significantly more accessible to the bacteria than glass coupon as revealed by the high population of bacteria recovered from their surfaces.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new 7 beta-(benzo[a]dihydrocarbazolyloxyacetyl)-substituted cephalosporins.
AB  - Selected 7beta-(benzo[a]dihydrocarbazolyloxyacetyl)-substituted cephalosporins (1a-e) were synthesised and tested for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens. All compounds synthesised (1a-e) showed an in vitro antimicrobial activity similar to that of ceftriaxone and cefpirome against the Gram-positive bacteria, and superior to that of penicillin and cefaclor against pen-R Staphylococcus aureus species. Like all beta-lactam agents, compounds 1a-e were in an inactive Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC > 32 microg/ml) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus species. Furthermore, as expected, no cross-resistance was observed against the erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus pyogenes strain. Finally, it is worth underlining that compounds 1a and 1e showed a similar activity to that of ceftriaxone and superior to cefaclor against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, a key respiratory tract infection (RTI) causing pathogen difficult to treat with currently marketed antibiotics.
TI  - Restless legs syndrome: association with streptococcal or mycoplasma infection.
AB  - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections have been reported to cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as chorea, tics, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, presumably through autoimmune damage to basal ganglia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections have also been reported to cause damage to the basal ganglia. Restless legs syndrome is a movement disorder with focal restlessness, an irresistible desire to move, and exacerbation by long periods of sitting or lying. We present three children with transient restless legs syndrome-like symptoms possibly associated with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. One of three patients had persistently elevated enzyme-linked immunosorbent optical density values against human caudate and putamen.
TI  - Antibacterial resistance of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens recovered from patients in Germany and activity of the Ketolide Telithromycin: results from the PROTEKT surveillance study (1999-2000).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the  Ketolide Telithromycin (PROTEKT) longitudinal global surveillance study examines the antibacterial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from isolates collected in Germany in 1999-2000 in the PROTEKT study show that 8.3% of pneumococcal isolates (n = 325) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin and 2.2% were fully resistant. Erythromycin resistance was 15.7% overall and particularly high in Leipzig (31.6%). All penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains were inhibited by telithromycin (MIC < or =0.5 mg/l) and linezolid (MIC < or =2 mg/l). Beta-lactamase was produced by 3.2% of Haemophilus influenzae (9/284) and 89.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains (111/124). All Streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 87) were susceptible to penicillin, although 9.2% were resistant to macrolides. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin resistance in Germany remains low; however, the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens is rising, particularly against macrolides. Continued surveillance is necessary to guide optimal empirical therapy, and new antimicrobials, like telithromycin, need to be developed with improved potency against target pathogens and low propensity for the development of resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes  and Haemophilus influenzae collected from patients across the USA, in 2001-2002, as part of the PROTEKT US study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The PROTEKT US (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin in the United States) surveillance programme was started in 2000, to chart the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae from across the USA. METHODS: In 2001-2002 (Year 2 of PROTEKT US) 242 centres from 46 states and the territory of Puerto Rico submitted a total of 10 012 S. pneumoniae, 4508 S. pyogenes and 3296 H. influenzae isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs). Susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted using NCCLS methodology and criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 35.4% of S. pneumoniae were non-susceptible to penicillin (14.2% intermediate, MIC 0.12-1 mg/L; 21.2% resistant, MIC > or =2 mg/L) and 27.9% were resistant to erythromycin (MIC > or =1 mg/L) (0.2% intermediate, MIC 0.5 mg/L). A total of 105 (1.0%) isolates were resistant to levofloxacin (MIC > or =8 mg/L). More than 99.2% of isolates were susceptible to telithromycin (MIC < or =1 mg/L) irrespective of penicillin and/or erythromycin resistance. All S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC < or =0.12 mg/L) and 5.7% were resistant to erythromycin (MIC > or =1 mg/L) (0.3% intermediate, MIC 0.5 mg/L). The MIC90 of telithromycin for S. pyogenes was 0.03 mg/L. A total of 27.5% of H. influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase producers. Overall, 27.8% were resistant (MIC > or =4 mg/L) and 1.1% were intermediate to ampicillin (MIC 2 mg/L). A total of 96.3% of H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to telithromycin (MIC < or =4 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance continues to be a problem in the USA. The ketolide telithromycin continues to show high activity against common CARTI pathogens, including those resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides.
TI  - Retrospective assessment of subacute or chronic osteomyelitis in children and young adults.
AB  - To identify factors associated with and to describe treatment outcomes of pediatric subacute or chronic osteomyelitis (S/CO), we retrospectively identified 52 patients with S/CO from January 1994 to November 1999 seen at a large pediatric hospital infectious disease clinic. S/CO was defined by the following: >10 days of clinical symptoms; radiographic, surgical, or pathologic changes consistent with S/CO; or relapse of prior osteomyelitis. Of these patients 63% were male, median age 9 years. Bones involved included vertebra (19% of subjects), femur (17%), finger (12%), humerus (10%), and tibia (8%). Sixty-five percent had at least 1 risk factor (most commonly hardware, neurologic disease or preceding trauma, sepsis, or surgery). Blood, bone, or wound aspirate cultures were positive in 67%, most commonly for Staphylococcus aureus. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 88% of 41 patients at the time of diagnosis. Intravenous antibiotics were given for a median of 6 weeks and oral antibiotics for a median of 4.5 months. One child had a complication. In conclusion, consideration of S/CO should be high when predisposing factors are present. ESR may be useful for determining effectiveness and duration of therapy. With prolonged antibiotic therapy nearly all patients demonstrated resolution of disease.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Increasing antibiotic resistance of streptococcus species in New York City.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus species are common pathogens in head and neck infections and are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Emerging penicillin-resistant streptococcal pathogens have shifted empirical antibiotic therapy in favor of valuable alternatives, including erythromycin and clindamycin. This study was undertaken to determine the magnitude of antimicrobial resistance to these antibiotics. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: A retrospective study of two streptococcal species isolates, Streptococcus pyogenes (163 specimens) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (164 specimens), collected between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002 at two academic institutions. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns were analyzed for penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: Fourteen percent to 34% of S. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin-resistant, and 0% to 28% were clindamycin-resistant. None of the S. pyogenes isolates were resistant to penicillin. Of the S. pneumoniae isolates, 33% to 50% were resistant to erythromycin, and 18% to 33% were resistant to clindamycin. The penicillin resistance levels for S. pneumoniae were 0% to 45%. CONCLUSIONS: Our antimicrobial resistance levels for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae significantly exceeded national and worldwide levels of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance. With a diverse population of over 8 million residents and high physician supply, our model is a microcosm for the study of antimicrobial use and susceptibility patterns and of clinical failure.
TI  - Characterization of plasmin(ogen) binding to Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The proteolytic activity of plasmin promotes migration of pathogenic bacteria through the human extracellular matrix. The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae binds both human plasminogen and plasmin via the surface displayed alpha-enolase designated Eno. Electron microscopic studies verified the surface exposition of the glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase and moreover, its ability to reassociate to the cell surface. Carboxyterminal lysine residues of recently described eukaryotic and prokaryotic plasminogen-binding proteins such as SEN of S. pyogenes are involved in interaction with lysine binding sites of kringle domains of plasminogen. In this study, the role of carboxy terminal lysyl residue of eno in plasminogen binding is further analysed. METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis of eno gene was done using DNA primers with Hind III-restriction enzyme sites for cloning. Purified Eno fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and human plasminogen binding assay was performed. Radioiodinated ligand binding was done by competitive inhibition assay. RESULTS: Binding assays performed under reduced conditions indicated also a role of the C-terminal lysyl residues of Eno for plasmin(ogen) binding. Binding of pneumococci to radioiodinated plasminogen was competitively inhibited in the presence of plasminogen, kringle 1-3 (LBS 1) and the lysineanalogon epsilon-amino caproic acid indicating the crucial role of lysine-binding sites of plasminogen. However, binding analysis of plasminogen and LBS 1 to wild type Eno and carboxy terminal modified Eno proteins did not reveal any difference in plasminogen-binding activity under native conditions. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The present results suggested the presence of a further plasminogenbinding motif in Eno. This hypothesis was confirmed by plasminogen-binding activity of reassociated C-terminal modified enolase to the pneumococcal surface and indicated, therefore, the presence of a further binding motif in Eno for plasminogen binding.
TI  - Comparative genomics of streptococcal species.
AB  - Microbial genome sequencing has produced an unprecedented amount of new information and insights into an organism's metabolic activities, virulence properties, and evolution. The complete genome sequence has been reported for four different species of streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. mutans. Comparative genome analysis among organisms of the same species not only shows a high degree of similarity in gene content and organization, but also a high degree of sequence heterogeneity as evidenced by the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms present. Considerable differences were also observed in the number of mobile genetic elements found in each organism, including complete and partial bacteriophage genomes, IS elements, transposons, and plasmids. S. pyogenes was the only species to contain complete bacteriophage genomes in its genome, while only S. pneumoniae and S. mutans contained the full complement of competence genes essential for natural transformation. Comparative genome analysis between the species showed that S. pyogenes was more closely related to S. agalactiae than with S. pneumoniae or S. mutans.
TI  - [Activity of telithromycin and other oral antibiotics against respiratory tract pathogens with acquired mechanisms of resistance].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and Streptococcus pyogenes has limited the usefulness of conventional agents for the treatment of some infectious diseases related with these microorganisms. There is thus a clear need for new antimicrobial agents active against these resistant strains. OBJECTIVES: To assess the in vitro susceptibility to telithromycin and other oral antimicrobial agents of 307 strains of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes with acquired mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and/or beta-lactams. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the agar dilution method, and results were preferentially evaluated according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: The activity of telithromycin against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae was excellent. All the strains were inhibited with 2 mg/l, regardless of the mechanism of macrolide resistance exhibited. Telithromycin was slightly more active than the tested macrolides in beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae strains, with a MIC90 of 2 mg/l. Telithromycin also demonstrated potent activity against macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes. The MIC of telithromycin was > 4 mg/l for only one out of the 202 tested strains. CONCLUSIONS: Telithromycin is a very promising therapeutic option against bacterial pathogens of the respiratory tract, including strains that have developed mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and/or beta-lactams.
TI  - Molecular characterisation of macrolide resistance mechanisms of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated in Germany, 2002-2003.
AB  - In the present study, a real-time PCR protocol was developed for the detection of macrolide resistance determinants and was validated in a nationwide study in Germany covering a total of 236 Streptococcus pyogenes and 241 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains collected from children < or = 16 years of age with community-acquired infections. Macrolide resistance was observed in 19.9% of pneumococcal strains and 14% of S. pyogenes isolates. Of the erythromycin A-resistant S. pyogenes strains, 93.9% showed the efflux type mef(A); 62.5% of the S. pneumoniae strains were mef(A)- and 37.5% erm(B)-positive. The correlation of the results of real-time PCR assay genotyping in the present study compared with those of conventional PCR genotyping and resistance phenotyping was 100%. Macrolide resistance is of growing concern in Germany. This highly sensitive and specific PCR assay to detect macrolide resistance has the potential to provide sufficiently rapid results to improve antibiotic treatment of streptococcal infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin and beta-lactam antimicrobials against community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract pathogens in the United States: findings from the PROTEKT US study, 2000-2001.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial that was developed to provide good activity against resistant respiratory tract pathogens. PROTEKT US (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin in the United States) is a multicenter in vitro surveillance study that was initiated in 2000 to chart the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs). OBJECTIVE: This article reports first-year results from PROTEKT US pertaining to the comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin and beta-lactam antimicrobials against community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: Data were compiled on the comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin and beta-lactams against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10,103 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (3918 isolates), and Haemophilus influenzae (2706 isolates). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibilities were determined according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods. RESULTS: In total, 38.8% (3920/10,103) of pneumococcal isolates were not susceptible to penicillin (12.5% [1266] intermediate [MIC, > or =0.12-1.0 mg/dL], 26.3% [2654] resistant [MIC, > or =2 mg/dL]). Telithromycin was highly active against S pneumoniae (MIC required to inhibit 90% of isolates [MIC(90)], 0.5 mg/L), with 99.6% (10,062/10,103) of isolates fully susceptible (MIC, < or =1 mg/L). Based on MIC(90)s, the rank order of antimicrobial activity was telithromycin (0.5 mg/L), followed by amoxicillin/clavulanate (2 mg/L), penicillin (4 mg/L), and cefuroxime (8 mg/L). Telithromycin retained high activity (MIC(90), 1 mg/L) against penicillin-resistant penumococci that showed high levels of coresistance to beta-lactams. All isolates of S pyogenes were fully susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. Beta-lactamase production was common among H influenzae isolates (28.3% [765/2706]). Telithromycin was active against H influenzae (MIC(90), 4 mg/L), irrespective of beta-lactamase production. CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings from the first year of PROTEKT US support the potential value of telithromycin in the treatment of CARTIs.
TI  - Localization of MtuA, an LraI homologue in Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the localization of MtuA, an LraI lipoprotein within Streptococcus uberis and assess whether the protein was able to induce an antibody response capable of growth inhibition. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunoblots and ELISAs were performed on S. uberis cell fractions to localize the protein. The strongest reactivity was within the membrane-enriched fraction. Electron micrographs also showed labelling consistent with a location within the membrane. Specific antibodies from both rabbits and calves were unable to inhibit the growth of S. uberis in milk. In addition, MtuA was not detectable in a whole-cell ELISA and whole bacterial cells were unable to adsorb specific antibodies from antiserum raised against MtuA. CONCLUSIONS: The MtuA protein appears to be located within the cell membrane and is not on the bacterial surface and thus not available for interaction with potentially growth-inhibiting antibodies. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Unlike PsaA of S. pneumoniae and MtsA of S. pyogenes, MtuA of S. uberis does not appear to be located at the cell surface. Therefore, in contrast to studies with other similar proteins, MtuA is unlikely to be a good vaccine candidate.
TI  - Aetiology of acute pharyngitis: the role of atypical bacteria.
AB  - In order to establish the role of atypical bacteria and compare characteristics of different infectious agents in acute pharyngitis, 127 patients with acute pharyngitis (66 males; median age, 5.33 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) and 130 healthy subjects of similar sex and age were studied. Serology with paired samples and PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat cultures were used to identify bacteria and viruses. Viruses were identified in 43 patients (33.8%) and five controls (3.8%; P < 0.0001), potential bacterial pathogens in 34 patients (26.8%) and 26 controls (20%; P = 0.256) and mixed viral/bacterial pathogens in 26 patients (20.5%) and none of the controls (P < 0.0001). The main aetiological agents were adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Chlamydia pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae was the agent found most frequently as a single pathogen. A history of recurrent pharyngitis, having older siblings and a negative outcome were significantly more common among patients with acute M. pneumoniae infection than among those with infections due to other pathogens or healthy controls. This study demonstrates that: (i) adenovirus and RSV have a prominent role in acute pharyngitis; (ii) S. pyogenes is found frequently, but it is not possible to distinguish simple carriers from patients with a true infection; (iii) M. pneumoniae appears to be able to cause acute pharyngitis per se; and (iv) C. pneumoniae seems to be mainly a co-pathogen. To avoid the risk of an incorrect therapeutic approach, simple laboratory investigations that allow rapid identification of M. pneumoniae infections are urgently needed.
TI  - Macrolide resistance in Streptococci and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem among pathogens from respiratory tract infections. b-Lactam resistance rates are escalating among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Macrolides are increasingly used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, but their utility is compromised by intrinsic and acquired resistance. This article analyses macrolide-resistance mechanisms and their worldwide distributions in S pneumoniae, S pyogenes, and H influenzae.
TI  - [Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(7-aminomethyl-5-azaspiro [2,4] hept-5-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxyl ic acid and its analogues].
AB  - AIM: To find new antibacterial agents of quinolone with high activity and low toxicity. METHODS: To design and synthesize 7-(7-aminomethyl-5-azaspiro [2,4] hept-5-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxyl ic acid and its analogues, and to study their antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Twenty new compounds (2 - 11, 17 - 26) were obtained including five targeted compounds (22 - 26). The structures of the compounds were confirmed by 1HNMR, MS and HRMS. Compounds 22 - 26 showed broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Especially for compound 24, the relevant MIC values for 13 strains of Gram-positive organisms were < 0.001 - 0.03 mg(-1), including 4 strains of S. pneumoniae, 2 strains of S. pyogenes, 3 strains of S. aureus and 2 strains of Enterococci which exhibited more potent activity than contrast agents (clinafloxacin and gatifloxacin). The MIC values of 24 for 6 strains Gram-positive organisms were 0.01 - 1 mg x L(-1), which exhibited equal or lower activity than contrast agents. They were more effective than ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin against intraperitoneal infections caused by S. pneumoniae and S. aureus in mice. CONCLUSION: Compounds (23, 24 and 26) showed excellent antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo and should be worth further investigation.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of a novel class of 4'-substituted 16-membered ring macrolides derived from tylosin.
AB  - Novel 4'-substituted 16-membered ring macrolides were synthesized by the cleavage of the mycarose sugar of tylosin and subsequent modification of 4'-hydroxyl group. This new class of macrolide antibiotics exhibited potent activity against some key erythromycin-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Zebrafish as a model host for streptococcal pathogenesis.
AB  - Streptococcal pathogens continue to evade concerted efforts to determine clear-cut virulence mechanisms, although numerous genes have been implicated in pathogenesis. A single species can infect a diversity of tissues, suggesting the expression of specific virulence factors based on the local tissue environment or stage of infection. In an effort to identify the interactions that occur between the host and pathogen that lead to activation of virulence mechanisms and contribute to specific streptococcal disease states, we have developed a unique animal model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), to characterize specific virulence mechanisms utilized within various tissues in vivo. We are using this model host to study infection by two streptococcal species that represent two forms of streptococcal disease: a natural pathogen of fish and humans, Streptococcus iniae and a human-specific pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes. S. iniae primarily causes a fatal systemic disease in the zebrafish following intra-muscular injection, with similar pathologies to that seen in human infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and S. pneumoniae. While the fatal infection by S. pyogenes causes a locally spreading necrotic disease confined to the muscle with pathology similar to what is observed in a human infection of necrotizing fasciitis. By studying pathogens that are virulent for both fish and humans and that mediate disease states in the zebrafish that are identical to those found in human streptococcal infections, we will be able to identify common virulence strategies shared by a number of Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - The Use of Ketolides in Treatment of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections.
AB  - Recent surveillance studies suggest that the incidence of resistance to macrolide antibiotics in common community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, is increasing and limiting the usefulness of these drugs. The ketolides, of which telithromycin is the first to be available for clinical use (but not yet in the United States), represent a new class of antibacterials developed specifically to combat respiratory tract pathogens that have acquired resistance to macrolides. The ketolides possess innovative structural modifications, a 3-keto group and a large N-substituted C11, C12-carbamate side chain. This novel structure allows ketolides, which are inhibitors of protein synthesis, to exert a more effective interaction with domain II of the 23S rRNA, enhancing binding to bacterial ribosomes and allowing binding to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistant ribosomes. This novel chemical structure also promotes greater stability of telithromycin in acid conditions, providing the potential for greater stability in gastric fluid and at cellular/tissue levels. Early clinical trials support the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of telithromycin in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as streptococcal pharyngitis and acute sinusitis, including infections caused by macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Common adverse side effects associated with telithromycin are predominantly gastrointestinal, usually of mild to moderate severity, and rarely involve withdrawal of the drug. Telithromycin represents an attractive option for the empiric treatment of upper RTIs, especially as resistance to macrolides is likely to continue to increase.
TI  - Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - We correlated outpatient antibiotic use with prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP), macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (MRSP), and macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes (MRGAS) in 20 countries. Total antibiotic use was correlated with PNSP (r = 0.75; p < 0.001), as was macrolide use with MRSP (r = 0.88; p < 0.001) and MRGAS (r = 0.71; p = 0.004). Streptococcal resistance is directly associated with antibiotic selection pressure on a national level.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  - Young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. Cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. Present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. Three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of AOM received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. Clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. There was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. A satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. In conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. Moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.
TI  - [What is the importance of bacterial eradication in the treatment of respiratory  tract infections?].
AB  - During the last few years, increasing antibiotic resistance amongst the major respiratory pathogens in the community has compromised the choice of empirical therapy for some respiratory tract infections. Of special interest has been the progressive increase in the resistance rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to macrolides and penicillin, and of S. pyogenes to macrolides. Several studies have confirmed the association between community use of certain antibiotics and the development of resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Nevertheless, not all the antibiotics have the same ability to select resistance and not all microorganisms are affected in the same way. The aim of antimicrobial therapy in respiratory tract infections is bacterial eradication. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics can be used to predict bacteriological eradication with antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Telithromycin].
AB  - For the time being telithromycin is the only representative of a new group of antibiotics - ketolides - available for clinical use. Its chemical structure is derived from erythromycin, but it is better resorbed from the digestive tract and is efficacious against most macrolide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Telithromycin is registered for the treatment of respiratory infections: sinusitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. The drug is well tolerated. It is less likely to induce MLS(B) resistance than macrolides with a 14- or 15-member ring.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression among low G+C gram-positive genomes.
AB  - We present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes in the low G+C Gram-positive genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Clostridium perfringens. Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.
TI  - Concentrations of moxifloxacin in serum and synovial fluid, and ex vivo bactericidal activity against arthritis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). The procedure was scheduled at four different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. Five patients were studied at each point of time. Drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. Bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the NCCLS guidelines. Mean (+/-S.D.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/L and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/L, respectively. Levels above 1.0 mg/L were detected as long as 24 h. The peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against Staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against Streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. On the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative genomics of gene-family size in closely related bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The wealth of genomic data in bacteria is helping microbiologists understand the factors involved in gene innovation. Among these, the expansion and reduction of gene families appears to have a fundamental role in this, but the factors influencing gene family size are unclear. RESULTS: The relative content of paralogous genes in bacterial genomes increases with genome size, largely due to the expansion of gene family size in large genomes. Bacteria undergoing genome reduction display a parallel process of redundancy elimination, by which gene families are reduced to one or a few members. Gene family size is also influenced by sequence divergence and physiological function. Large gene families show wider sequence divergence, suggesting they are probably older, and certain functions (such as metabolite transport mechanisms) are overrepresented in large families. The size of a given gene family is remarkably similar in strains of the same species and in closely related species, suggesting that homologous gene families are vertically transmitted and depend little on horizontal gene transfer (HGT). CONCLUSIONS: The remarkable preservation of copy numbers in widely different ecotypes indicates a functional role for the different copies rather than simply a back-up role. When different genera are compared, the increase in phylogenetic distance and/or ecological specialization disrupts this preservation, albeit in a gradual manner and maintaining an overall similarity, which also supports this view. HGT can have an important role, however, in nonhomologous gene families, as exemplified by a comparison between saprophytic and enterohemorrhagic strains of Escherichia coli.
TI  - The pathogenesis of streptococcal infections: from tooth decay to meningitis.
AB  - The development of bacterial disease has been likened to a 'molecular arms race', in which the host tries to eliminate the bacteria, while the bacteria try to survive in the host. Although most bacteria do not cause disease, some cause serious human infection in a large proportion of encounters. Between these two extremes are bacteria that can coexist with humans in a carriage state but, under appropriate circumstances, cause disease. The streptococci exemplify this group of organisms, and by studying them we can begin to address why bacteria cause such a wide spectrum of disease.
TI  - Optimizing antibacterial therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections in children in an era of bacterial resistance.
AB  - The spread of antibacterial resistance in bacteria that commonly cause childhood  community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs), such as acute otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute pharyngitis, is a major healthcare problem. One of the foremost concerns is the rapid increase in penicillin, macrolide, and multidrug resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. There is also a rising prevalence of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes in pockets of the United States, and beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus influenzae is widespread. Although data are limited, some evidence suggests that resistance to antibacterials can impair bacteriologic and clinical outcomes in childhood RTIs. Optimizing antibacterial use is important both in the care of individual patients and within strategies to address the wider problem of antibacterial resistance. This involves encouraging judicious antibacterial use (i.e., reducing overuse for viral infection and prophylaxis), and preventing misuse through the wrong choice, dosage, and duration of therapy. Given that initial therapy is usually empiric, antibacterials used to treat community-acquired RTIs in children should ideally have the following properties: an optimal targeted spectrum of activity; high clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against respiratory pathogens, including resistant strains; simple, short-course therapy; and good tolerability and palatability. New antibacterials will continue to have a role in the treatment of RTIs in children, especially where resistance compromises existing therapies.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral Cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activities of oral Cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and Peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) strains. The MICs of Cephems except cefaclor (CCL) were < or = 0.03 microgram/mL against all strains of S. pyogenes. The MICs of cefteram (CFTM) and cefditoren (CDTR) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/mL activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). However the MIC90s of cefditoren (CDTR) was 1 microgram/mL, cefteram (CFTM), and cefcapene (CFPN) were 2 micrograms/mL against PISP and PRSP, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than PSSP. The MIC90s of Cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/mL against strains of E. coli. The MIC90s of CFTM was 0.5 microgram/mL, and CDTR, CFPN were 1 microgram/mL against E. coli were higher than those of other drugs. The four strains of E. coli however were highly-resistant which MIC90s of CCL were more than 32 micrograms/mL were obtains. Furthermore it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant such as E. coli of Cephems. Although all strains showed resistant to AMPC, MIC90 of Cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/mL, good activities against K. pneumoniae. Against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae (BLNAS) 23 strains the MIC90s of CCL and other Cephems were 64 micrograms/mL and 0.25-8 micrograms/mL. The MIC90s of CDTR and CFTM were < or = 1 microgram/mL of BLNAR (15 strains). However there of CFDN and CPDX were 8 micrograms/mL and CCL were > or = 16 micrograms/mL. Two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--ABPC resistant. Although B. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and Cephems except for CCL showed better susceptibility than AMPC. The MIC90s of Cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/mL against Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from a paediatric population in Great Britain and Ireland: the in vitro activity of telithromcycin versus comparators.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinical  isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, isolated from children within Great Britain and Ireland (Northern Ireland and Eire), with particular reference to the new oral ketolide telithromycin. To determine the distribution of macrolide resistance genes within the erythromycin resistant population. METHODS: MICs were determined using NCCLS microbroth dilution methodology and macrolide resistance mechanisms were investigated using PCR. RESULTS: Penicillin susceptibility was found to be 92.6% in S. pneumoniae isolates ( n=831; 3.7% intermediate, MIC 0.12-1 mg/l, 3.7% resistant, MIC >2.0 mg/l) and 100% in S. pyogenes isolates (n=1333) 8.8% of S. pneumoniae and 2.5% of S. pyogenes isolates demonstrated erythromycin-A resistance (EryA(R)). One hundred percent of S. pneumoniae and 99.8% of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to telithromycin (MIC<or=1.0 mg/l). Of the 73 EryA(R) S. pneumoniae isolates tested, 55 (75.3%) were mef (A) positive, 17 (23.3%) erm (B) positive and one isolate (1.4%) was positive for both mechanisms. Of the 34 isolates of EryA(R) S. pyogenes tested, 23 (67.6%) were erm (A) subclass erm (TR) positive, 4 (11.8%) erm (B) and 7 (20.6%) mef (A) positive. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents baseline data on penicillin and macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates in the paediatric population of Great Britain and Ireland. Telithromycin, recently approved for the treatment of community acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) in patients over 12 years of age throughout the European community, demonstrated high in vitro activity against these pathogens, including EryA(R) strains.
TI  - Bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subperiosteal abscess (SA) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (AM). Of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated from the SA. We suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of AM. The purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause SA and mastoid cortex erosion in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for SA between May 1984 and April 2002 were evaluated. RESULTS: Mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses Purulent discharge was obtained from the SA cavity in 28 cases. The commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid SA is a unilateral disease that can recur. Early administration of anti-Staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with SA as a complication of AM.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the peptide deformylase inhibitor BB-83698.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: BB-83698 is a peptide deformylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials in Europe. The purpose of this study was to provide additional susceptibility data from clinical isolates, including drug-resistant strains. METHODS: The in vitro activities of BB-83698 and comparators were determined against 281 streptococci, 154 Staphylococcus aureus, 110 Haemophilus influenzae and 50 Moraxella catarrhalis strains selected for their resistance phenotypes. Broth microdilution MICs and MBCs were determined according to NCCLS guidelines. RESULTS: The MIC90s were 0.25-0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-, erythromycin-, levofloxacin- and multidrug-resistant strains. The MIC90s for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.12 mg/L and for viridans streptococci, the MIC90 was 0.5 mg/L. Against S. aureus, including oxacillin- and levofloxacin-resistant strains, and vancomycin-intermediate strains, the MIC90 was 8 mg/L. Against beta-lactamase-negative and -positive H. influenzae, the MIC90s were 32 and 64 mg/L, respectively, and against both beta-lactamase-negative and -positive M. catarrhalis the MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. In MBC studies, the ratio of MBC/MIC was 1:1 or 2:1 against 31% of S. pneumoniae, 33% of S. aureus, 63% of H. influenzae and 9% of M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BB-83698 has reduced in vitro activity against H. influenzae, it is a potent antimicrobial with excellent activity against streptococci and Moraxella.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Activity of oral antibiotics against respiratory tract pathogens in Spain.
AB  - The aim of this study was to carry out a nationwide survey to assess the susceptibility of clinical isolates of four respiratory pathogens against nine antibiotics. Eight Spanish centers participated in the study, collecting a total of 977 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was 37.46% susceptible, 30.43% intermediate and 32.11% resistant. MIC(90) of all antibiotics against this microorganism were 48 mg/l, except cefaclor, cefixime and azithromycin. For S. pyogenes, all the strains were susceptible to penicillins and cephalosporins, and azithromycin was the least active with a rate of resistance of 11.43%. A total of 95 isolates of H. influenzae were betalactamase positive (26.32%). With regard to M. catarrhalis, only penicillin and amoxicillin showed MICs(90) >=8 mg/l.
TI  - rpoB gene sequence-based identification of aerobic Gram-positive cocci of the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Abiotrophia, and Granulicatella.
AB  - We developed a new molecular tool based on rpoB gene (encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. We first sequenced the complete rpoB gene for Streptococcus anginosus, S. equinus, and Abiotrophia defectiva. Sequences were aligned with these of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae available in GenBank. Using an in-house analysis program (SVARAP), we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and, by using these conserved zones as PCR primer targets, we amplified and sequenced this variable region in an additional 30 Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Abiotrophia species. This region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. We therefore applied our identification system by PCR amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. Amplicons were obtained in streptococci and Bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. Molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the S. pneumoniae-S. oralis-S. mitis group and the S. agalactiae-S. difficile group. These signatures allowed us to design a S. pneumoniae-specific PCR and sequencing primer pair.
TI  - Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome as a result of non-meningococcal infection.
AB  - Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome--massive adrenal haemorrhage in the setting of overwhelming clinical sepsis--is usually taken at necropsy to indicate meningococcal infection, and may be the only evidence of this pathogen. This report describes three fatal cases of the syndrome in which the causative organism proved to be a streptococcus. The organisms were detected during routine coroners' autopsies with histology and microbiological investigations. In two cases, the syndrome followed Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and in a third beta haemolytic streptococcus group A. Thus, adrenal haemorrhage alone cannot be taken to indicate meningococcal disease and other pathogens, particularly streptococcus, must be considered.
TI  - High levels of IgG class antibodies to recombinant HSP60 kDa of Yersinia enterocolitica in sera of patients with uveitis.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the levels of IgG class antibodies to recombinant heat shock protein 60 kDa of Yersinia enterocolitica (rHSP60Ye), Klebsiella pneumoniae (rHSP60Kp), Escherichia coli (rHSP60Ec), Shigella flexneri (rHSP60Sf), and Streptococcus pyogenes (rHSP60Sp) in the serum of patients with HLA-B27 associated acute anterior uveitis (HLA-B27 associated AAU), idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (idiopathic AAU), pars planitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH), and healthy subjects. METHODS: The genes that code for HSP60Ye, HSP60Kp, HSP60Ec, HSP60Sf, and HSP60Sp were cloned by PCR from genomic DNA. The rHSPs were purified by affinity using a Ni-NTA resin. The serum levels of IgG class antibodies to rHSP60s were determined by ELISA in patients with uveitis (n = 42) and in healthy subjects (n = 25). RESULTS: The majority of patients with uveitis had higher levels of IgG class antibodies to rHSP60Ye compared with levels of healthy subjects (p = 0.01), although these differences were only observed in the HLA-B27 associated AAU (p = 0.005) and in pars planitis patients (p = 0.001). The levels of IgG antibodies to the rHSP60Kp, rHSP60Sf, rHSP60Ec, and rHSP60Sp were similar in patients with uveitis and in healthy subjects (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that HSP60Ye could be involved in the aetiology of HLA-B27 associated AAU and pars planitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide derivative exhibiting innovative microbiological properties against well-characterised antibiotic resistant pathogens in Italy.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. ABT773 was active (MIC-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were also inhibited (MIC-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. Enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to ABT773 with the exception of VanA mutants. E. faecium showed poor susceptibility to ABT773. The activity of the new ketolide against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. ABT773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in the nasopharyngeal flora of children with acute maxillary sinusitis and maxillary sinusitis recurring after amoxicillin therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms isolated from the nasopharynx of children who present with acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) or maxillary sinusitis that recurred (RMS) after amoxicillin therapy. METHODS: Analysis of nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 70 patients, 42 with AMS and 28 with RMS. RESULTS: Thirty-eight potentially pathogenic organisms were recovered in 36 (86%) of the children from the AMS group, and 40 were isolated from 26 (93%) of the children from the RMS group. The organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (21 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (17), Moraxella catarrhalis (15), Streptococcus pyogenes (13) and Staphylococcus aureus (12). Resistance to the eight antimicrobial agents used was found in 34 instances in the AMS group compared to 93 instances in the RMS group (P < 0.005). The difference between AMS and RMS was significant with S. pneumoniae resistance to amoxicillin (P < 0.0025), to co-amoxiclav (P < 0.0025), to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (P < 0.05), to cefixime (P < 0.05), and to azithromycin (P < 0.05), and for H. influenzae to amoxicillin (P < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate the higher recovery rate of antimicrobial-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae from the nasopharynx of children who had maxillary sinusitis that recurred after amoxicillin therapy than those with AMS.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological efficacy of the ketolide telithromycin against isolates of key respiratory pathogens: a pooled analysis of phase III studies.
AB  - A pooled analysis of data from 13 phase III studies of telithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis or group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis was undertaken. Causative key respiratory tract pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) were isolated at entry to the studies from cultures of relevant respiratory samples and tested for their susceptibility to telithromycin, penicillin and macrolides (erythromycin A). The combined clinical and bacteriological efficacy of telithromycin at the post-therapy, test-of-cure visit (days 17-24) was assessed in patients from whom a microbiologically evaluable pathogen was isolated at entry. More than 98% of key respiratory pathogens isolated, including penicillin G- and macrolide (erythromycin A)-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, demonstrated full or intermediate susceptibility to telithromycin in vitro at the breakpoints of < or = 1.0 mg/L (susceptible) and 2.0 mg/L (intermediate) used for the purpose of evaluating the susceptibility of isolates recovered during the clinical trials. Treatment with telithromycin 800 mg once-daily for 5, 7 or 7-10 days resulted in high rates of clinical cure (88.5%) and a satisfactory bacteriological outcome (88.9%), similar to the figures seen with comparator antibacterial agents. Clinical cure and eradication rates were good for all key respiratory pathogens, including penicillin G- and macrolide (erythromycin A)-resistant S. pneumoniae. The results suggest that telithromycin will provide effective empirical therapy for community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography detection of ribosomal mutations conferring macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Mutations in genes coding for L4 (rplD) or L22 (rplV) ribosomal proteins or in 23S rRNA (rrl gene) are reported as a cause of macrolide resistance in streptococci and staphylococci. This study was aimed at evaluating a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) technique as a rapid mutation screening method. Portions of these genes were amplified by PCR from total DNA of 48 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 16), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 6), Streptococcus oralis (n = 2), and group G streptococcus (n = 2). Thirty-seven of these strains were resistant to macrolides and harbored one or several mutations in one or two of the target genes, and 11 were susceptible. PCR products were analyzed by DHPLC. All mutations were detected, except a point mutation in a pneumococcal rplD gene. The method detected one mutated rrl copy out of six in S. aureus. This automated method is promising for screening of mutations involved in macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - Microbiology of otitis media in Costa Rican children, 1999 through 2001.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the increasing number of resistant middle ear pathogens and the impact of the new conjugate Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine, an active surveillance of the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens is required. OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens obtained from Costa Rican children with acute otitis media (AOM), recurrent otitis media (ROM) and therapeutic failure otitis media (FOM). METHODS: Between 1999 and 2001 middle ear fluid (MEF) was collected from 276 Costa Rican patients. S. pneumoniae serotyping and pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis was done on available strains. RESULTS: Among the total study population, 102 were AOM patients, 98 were ROM patients and 76 were FOM patients. Overall S. pneumoniae (88 strains) was the most common pathogen isolated followed by Haemophilus influenzae (41 strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes (10 strains). H. influenzae was the most common agent in FOM patients (P = 0.015). Beta-lactamase production was observed in 3 of 41 (7%) H. influenzae strains and 3 of 3 (100%) Moraxella catarrhalis strains. Penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae strains were more common in FOM (64%) and ROM (63%) patients than in AOM (42%) patients (P = 0.05). S. pneumoniae serotype 19F was the most prevalent serotype, mainly within one distinct clone. CONCLUSIONS: Overall S. pneumoniae serotype 19F was the most common isolate from the middle ear fluid of Costa Rican children. Beta-lactamase-negative H. influenzae was the most prevalent in the subpopulation of patients with FOM. S. pyogenes was the third most common isolate and M. catarrhalis was uncommon.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens in the USA: data from PROTEKT US 2000-01.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The PROTEKT US surveillance program (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin in the United States) commenced in 2000 to document the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens in the United States. METHODS: During 2000-2001, 206 centers from 154 cities/metropolitan areas collected 16,727 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pneumoniae, n=10103, Streptococcus pyogenes, n=3918, Haemophilus influenzae, n=2706). RESULTS: Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 38.9% showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (12.5% intermediate, 26.4% resistant) with marked geographical variability. The erythromycin resistance rate was 31.0% and highly correlated with penicillin resistance. The rate of fluoroquinolone resistance was 0.8%. Telithromycin was nearly uniformly active against S. pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l). All isolates of S. pyogenes were penicillin-susceptible, 5.5% were resistant to erythromycin. Telithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were lower than clindamycin and macrolide MICs against S. pyogenes (MIC(90) 0.03 mg/l versus 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively). 28.3% of H. influenzae isolates produced beta-lactamase. Telithromycin activity versus H. influenzae was not affected by beta-lactamase production. CONCLUSIONS: The PROTEKT US study confirms the widespread prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial respiratory pathogens in the US, and re-affirms the importance of continued surveillance to guide optimum empiric therapy for patients with Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs). The new ketolide, telithromycin, maintained potent activity against study isolates in vitro and offers promise for the effective treatment of CARTIs.
TI  - Antibacterial resistance among children with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (PROTEKT 1999-2000).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of bacterial respiratory tract pathogens, isolated from children (0-12 years) as part of the global PROTEKT surveillance study (1999-2000), to a range of antibacterials, including the ketolide telithromycin. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibacterials studied were determined at a central laboratory using the NCCLS microdilution broth method. Macrolide resistance mechanisms were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Of 779 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates worldwide, 43% were non-susceptible to penicillin (18% intermediate; 25% resistant) and 37% were resistant to erythromycin, with considerable intercountry variation. Eighteen per cent of 653 Haemophilus influenzae and >90% of 316 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates produced beta-lactamase. Of 640 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 10% were resistant to erythromycin, with considerable intercountry variation. All S. pneumoniae and 99.8% of H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to telithromycin using breakpoints proposed to the NCCLS (<or=1 and <or=4 mg/L, respectively). All M. catarrhalis and 97% of S. pyogenes and isolates were susceptible to <or=1 mg/L telithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Antibacterial resistance complicates the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections in children and requires continued monitoring. Telithromycin may be a useful therapeutic alternative as it is highly active against strains exhibiting various resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Structure-based design, synthesis, and antimicrobial activity of indazole-derived SAH/MTA nucleosidase inhibitors.
AB  - The structure-based design, synthesis, and biological activity of a novel indazole-containing inhibitor series for S-adenosyl homocysteine/methylthioadenosine (SAH/MTA) nucleosidase are described. Use of 5-aminoindazole as the core scaffold provided a structure-guided series of low nanomolar inhibitors with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The implementation of structure-based methodologies provided a 6000-fold increase in potency over a short timeline (several months) and an economy of synthesized compounds.
TI  - Bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of oral gatifloxacin for the treatment of recurrent/nonresponsive acute otitis media: an open label, noncomparative, double tympanocentesis study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gatifloxacin is an 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone with good activity against respiratory pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To document the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of gatifloxacin in recurrent/nonresponsive acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: One hundred sixty patients 6 to 48 months of age with recurrent/nonresponsive AOM received gatifloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg once daily for 10 days). Recurrent AOM was defined as > or =3 AOM episodes during the previous 6 months or > or =4 AOM episodes during the previous 12 months. Nonresponsive AOM was defined as AOM occurring < or =14 days after completing antibiotic treatment or not improving after > or =48 h of therapy. Middle ear fluid (MEF) obtained by tympanocentesis pretreatment (Day 1) and 3 to 5 days after initiation of treatment (Days 4 to 6) was cultured. Additional MEF cultures were obtained if clinical failure or recurrence of AOM occurred. Bacteriologic failure was defined by culture-positive MEF during treatment. Patients were followed until Days 22 to 28. Susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight (80%) patients completed treatment, and 32 discontinued the study prematurely (adverse events, 17; lost to follow-up, 10; consent withdrawal, 3; and laboratory abnormalities, 2). From 89 patients (median age, 1 year; median number of prior AOM episodes, 4; range, 0 to 12), 121 pathogens were recovered: Haemophilus influenzae, 74 (61%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 36 (30%); Moraxella catarrhalis, 9 (7%); and Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 (2%). The 36 S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to gatifloxacin (MIC50 0.25 microg/ml); 26 of 36 (72%) were penicillin-nonsusceptible (15 fully resistant). All 74 H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to gatifloxacin (MIC < or = 0.03 mg/ml). Fourteen of 74 (19%) and 9 of 9 (100%) H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates, respectively, produced beta-lactamase. Bacteriologic eradication was achieved for 118 of 121 (98%) pathogens: 74 of 74 H. influenzae; 34 of 36 (94%) S. pneumoniae; 9 of 9 M. catarrhalis; and 1 of 2 S. pyogenes. Clinical improvement/cure at end of treatment was seen in 103 of 114 (90%) clinically evaluable patients. Clinical recurrence of AOM after completion of therapy occurred in 31 patients. Of the 27 recurrent AOM cases in which tympanocentesis was performed, there were 16 (59%) new infections, 4 (15%) culture-negative results and only 7 (26%) true bacteriologic relapses. Adverse events were recorded in 21 of 160 (13%) patients: vomiting, 16; diarrhea, 3; maculopapular rash, 2. No articular adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSION: Gatifloxacin is efficacious and safe for the treatment of recurrent/nonresponsive AOM.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Leontopodium alpinum (Edelweiss).
AB  - Extracts and individual constituents of Leontopodium alpinum Cass. (Asteraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activity in two different assays. Extracts were screened in agar diffusion assays, whereas the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of single compounds were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to NCCLS criteria. Significant antimicrobial activities were found against various strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. These results support the ethnomedicinal use of Leontopodium alpinum for the treatment of respiratory and abdominal disorders.
TI  - MgrA, an orthologue of Mga, Acts as a transcriptional repressor of the genes within the rlrA pathogenicity islet in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae normally resides in the human nasopharynx in a nondisease state. In response to unknown triggers this organism can descend to the lower respiratory tract and/or invade the bloodstream. Regulation and activation of virulence genes play essential roles in this process of disease development. Characterization of S. pneumoniae regulatory networks has been a recent area of interest, but despite inroads little is known about regulation of virulence genes in this pathogen. A putative transcriptional regulator in S. pneumoniae, mgrA, which exhibits homology to the virulence gene activator mga of group A streptococcus, was previously identified as a regulator that is required for development of pneumonia in a murine model. In this study we confirmed that mgrA plays a role in both nasopharyngeal carriage and pneumonia. Transcriptional profiling by microarray technology was used to show that mgrA acts as a repressor of the previously characterized rlrA pathogenicity islet. This is manifested phenotypically by a decrease in adherence to epithelial cells in tissue culture since the rlrA pathogenicity islet contains genes mediating adherence.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among isolates of respiratory tract infection pathogens  from the southern United States: data from the PROTEKT US surveillance program 2000/2001.
AB  - BACKGROUND: PROTEKT US (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology  for the Ketolide Telithromycin in the United States) was established in 2000 to monitor antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens across the United States. METHODS: During 2000 to 2001, 75 southern US centers collected 3,867 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1,455 Streptococccus pyogenes and 1,042 Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: Overall, 46.1% of S. pneumoniae isolates were nonsusceptible to penicillin, 35.8% were resistant to erythromycin, and 0.5% were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Against S. pneumoniae the most active agents were telithromycin (99.7% susceptible), linezolid (99.8%) and the fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin 99.4%, gatifloxacin 99.5%). The prevalence of erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes isolates was 4.5%. Telithromycin, at concentration of < or = 1 mg/L, inhibited 99.9% of S. pyogenes. The prevalence of beta-lactamase positive H. influenzae was 26.2%. Telithromycin was active (MIC90 4 mg/L) against H. influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of penicillin and macrolide resistance among respiratory tract pathogens from the southern United States is high. Fluoroquinolone resistance is low. Telithromycin is highly active against respiratory tract pathogens with reduced susceptibility to beta-lactams, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (AOM) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. OBJECTIVES: To report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with Streptococcus pneumoniae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) AOM. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen episodes of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). The average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases during the study period. Acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of AOM in 10 (10%) patients. Fever >38 degrees C and >15,000 WBC/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. Irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; P < 0.002). Computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). Periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. Simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. Cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). Overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. The most commonly isolated organisms were S. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and Escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). All S. pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in Southern Israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of AOM with significantly higher rates of S. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable H. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel.
TI  - Telithromycin post-antibiotic and post-antibiotic sub-MIC effects for 10 Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Post-antibiotic effects (PAE) and post-antibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA-SME) of the ketolide telithromycin (HMR 3647) were determined for 10 Gram-positive cocci with various macrolide resistance mechanisms, including inducible and constitutive ribosomal methylase and macrolide efflux resistance genes. Strains tested included four Streptococcus pneumoniae, three Streptococcus pyogenes and three Staphylococcus aureus. Telithromycin MICs were 0.008-0.015 mg/L for pneumococci, 0.015-4.0 mg/L for S. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/L for staphylococci. PAE were determined after exposure of strains at 10 x MIC for 1 h. PA-SME were determined in the presence of 0.12x, 0.25x and 0.5x MIC of the agent after the initial 1 h exposure period. The PAE of telithromycin varied from 0.3 to 3.8 h; the PA-SME varied from 0.8 to 4.6 h, with maximal PA-SME varying from 1.5 to 4.6 h. PAE tended to be shortest for S. pyogenes (0.4-2.7 h) and S. aureus (0.3-2.4 h), compared to 1.5-3.8 h for S. pneumoniae. The duration of the PA-SME was similar for the three species tested. The low MICs for many strains as well as the PAE and PA-SME demonstrated in this study for telithromycin show promise for increasing the dosing interval of this ketolide, but will need verification by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical studies.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and macrolide resistance genes of viridans  group streptococci from normal flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities and macrolide resistance mechanisms of viridans group streptococci isolated from the normal flora. METHODS: In vitro susceptibilities of 16 antimicrobials were studied for 161 viridans streptococci (on average 5.8 isolates per person) from the normal flora of 28 elderly persons. Resistance mechanisms of erythromycin-resistant isolates were studied by the double disc test and PCR. RESULTS: In all, 16.8% of the isolates were non-susceptible (MIC > or =0.25 mg/L) to penicillin, but none showed high-level resistance (MIC > or =4 mg/L). Resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was found in 22.4, 27.3, 13.0, 1.9 and 1.9% of the isolates, respectively. Combined resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline was found in 13.0% of the isolates. Erythromycin-resistant isolates were isolated from 57% of the study persons. Of the erythromycin-resistant isolates 80.6% were of the M phenotype and 19.4% were of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotype (one isolate with constitutive and six with inducible expression). Isolates with the M phenotype were the least susceptible to telithromycin, a new ketolide. The mef(A) gene was found in the isolates with the M phenotype and the erm(B) gene in the isolates with the MLSB phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of phenotypes among the viridans streptococci resembles that found in Streptococcus pyogenes, with predominance of the M phenotype. However, the coding gene for the MLSB phenotype, erm(B), is the same in viridans streptococci as in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viridans group streptococci carrying different resistance traits provide a pool of resistant bacteria that may transfer resistance determinants to more pathogenic organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin and beta-lactam antimicrobials against bacterial pathogens from community-acquired respiratory tract infections: data from the first year of PROTEKT (1999-2000).
AB  - The in vitro activity of telithromycin, a new ketolide, was compared with beta-lactam antimicrobials against pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections. These pathogens were collected during 1999-2000 as part of the ongoing PROTEKT surveillance study. Globally, penicillin nonsusceptibility among Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3362) was 36.3%, ranging from 21.5% (Australasia) to 68.0% (Far East). Telithromycin showed higher potency (MIC90 0.12 mg/L) than beta-lactams against S. pneumoniae; 99.9% of all and 99.6% of multi-resistant isolates were susceptible to telithromycin. Among Streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 1485), 100% were susceptible to beta-lactams, and the telithromycin MIC50 and MIC90 were both 0.015 mg/L. Among Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2948), 16.6% produced beta-lactamase, which reduced the activity of ampicillin, cefaclor and cefprozil. 99.9% of H. influenzae were susceptible to telithromycin and the MIC range for M. catarrhalis was 0.004-0.5 mg/L. The first year results of PROTEKT confirmed high potency for telithromycin against common respiratory tract pathogens, including beta-lactam-resistant strains.
TI  - The novel conjugative transposon tn1207.3 carries the macrolide efflux gene mef(A) in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The macrolide efflux gene mef(A) of the Streptococcus pyogenes clinical strain 2812A was found to be carried by a 52-kb chromosomal genetic element that could be transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of other streptococcal species. The characteristics of this genetic element are typical of conjugative transposons and was named Tn1207.3. The size of Tn1207.3 was established by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and DNA sequencing analysis showed that the 7,244 bp at the left end of Tn1207.3 were identical to those of the pneumococcal Tn1207.1 element. Tn1207.3-like genetic elements were found to be inserted at a single specific chromosomal site in 12 different clinical isolates S. pyogenes exhibiting the M phenotype of resistance to macrolides and carrying the mef(A) gene. Tn1207.3 was transferred from S. pyogenes 2812A to Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sequence analysis carried out on six independent transconjugants showed that insertion of Tn1207.3 in the pneumococcal genome always occurred at a single specific site as in Tn1207.1. Using MF2, a representative S. pneumoniae transconjugant, as a donor, Tn1207.3 was transferred again by conjugation to S. pyogenes and Streptococcus gordonii. The previously described nonconjugative element Tn1207.1 of S. pneumoniae appears to be a defective element, part of a longer conjugative transposon that carries mef(A) and is found in clinical isolates of S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Susceptibility of major pathogens of acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis to levofloxacin and other oral antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - A total of 2865 strains of the causative organisms isolated from the patients with acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis at the primary medical institutions were used in this study. The MICs of levofloxacin (LVFX) and other oral antimicrobial drugs were determined and evaluated by the NCCLS guideline. LVFX, cefditoren (CDTR) and cefcapene (CFPN) were potently active against 773 isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, the MIC50S of LVFX being < or = 0.06 microgram/mL and also the same as the MIC90S of LVFX. LVFX was the most active against 496 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC50S of LVFX were < or = 0.06 microgram/mL and were lower than those of CDTR, cefdinir (CFDN) and cefpodoxime (CPDX) (MIC50S: 0.5 microgram/mL). The MIC90S of these cephems were markedly higher than the respective MIC50S, whereas MIC50 of LVFX was 0.12 microgram/mL, only twice the MIC50. Against the majority of Streptococcus pyogenes (555 isolates) and Streptococcus spp. (495 isolates), CDTR, CFDN, CPDX and CFPN were highly active (MICs: < or = 0.06 microgram/mL), and clarithromycin (CAM) and azithromycin (AZM) were also active against these organisms (MICs: 0.12 to 0.25 microgram/mL). Against S. pneumoniae (92 isolates), CDTR and CFDN were active (MIC50S: 0.12 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively). However, the MIC90S of these drugs were 4-8 times the MIC50S. Against Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (454 isolates), LVFX was potently active, the MIC90 of LVFX being < or = 0.06 microgram/mL and MIC90S of the other cephems being 0.5 microgram/mL or more. When the susceptibility of these strains to LVFX was evaluated by the NCCLS guideline, about 3% of other Streptococcus spp. were resistant to the drug but no test strains resistant to LVFX were detected in H. influenzae, S. pyogenes or Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, the percentages of strains susceptible to the cephems tested were 60-90%, which were quite different according to kinds of drugs and species used. Furthermore, the strains of S. pneumoniae resistant to CFDN and CPDX, and those to CAM and AZM were 21-25% and 50% or more, respectively, whereas no LVFX-resistant strains were detected. The major pathogens isolated from patients with pharyngitis and tonsillitis in the primary institutions were highly susceptible to LVFX. These results suggest that LVFX is a useful drug which is potently active against the strains resistant to oral cephem and macrolide antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. Bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. S. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. Antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as EM and CAM, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide, RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than 14-membered macrolides. Six, three and four strains of S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. Thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, MIC of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of EM, CAM or AZM. Isolation frequency of resistant strains to RKM was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides: only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. No resistant strain was recognized in M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Further, we analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant strains by the double-disk method. Methylation was major mechanism in S. aureus, and in S. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. In S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.
TI  - MtuA, a lipoprotein receptor antigen from Streptococcus uberis, is responsible for acquisition of manganese during growth in milk and is essential for infection of the lactating bovine mammary gland.
AB  - A mutant strain of Streptococcus uberis (AJS001) that was unable to grow in bovine milk was isolated following random insertional mutagenesis. The level of growth in milk was restored to that of the parental strain (strain 0140J) following addition of MnSO(4) but not following addition of other metal ions. The mutant contained a single insertion within mtuA, a homologue of mtsA and psaA, which encode metal-binding proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. Strain AJS001 was unable to infect any of eight quarters on four dairy cows following intramammary challenge with 10(5) CFU. Bacteria were never recovered directly from milk of these animals but were detected following enrichment in Todd-Hewitt broth in three of eight milk samples obtained within 24 h of challenge. The animals showed no inflammatory response and no signs of mastitis. Three mammary quarters on two different animals simultaneously challenged with 600 CFU of the parental strain, strain 0140J, became colonized, shed high numbers of S. uberis organisms in milk, displayed a marked inflammatory response to infection, and showed overt signs of mastitis. These data indicate that mtuA was required for efficient uptake of Mn(2+) during growth in bovine milk and infection of the lactating bovine mammary gland.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of 4903 bacterial isolates to gemifloxacin--an advanced fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. Susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MIC90 values for gemifloxacin were: S. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; Haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; Moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; Enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; Neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. The MIC90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the other quinolones tested against S. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). This study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against Gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, Gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against Greek Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates with different macrolide susceptibilities.
AB  - The susceptibilities to macrolides and telithromycin of 161 Streptococcus pyogenes and 145 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, consecutively isolated from five Greek hospitals, were determined by Etest. Moreover, mechanisms of resistance to macrolides were phenotypically and genetically determined by double disk induction test and PCR, respectively. Of the S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates, 42.8% and 30.8%, respectively, were found to be resistant to erythromycin. Of the erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates, 57.5% and 59.5%, respectively, displayed the M phenotype and harbored the mefA/E gene. Telithromycin was found to be more active than both erythromycin and clarithromycin against both species, with considerably lower MIC50 and MIC90 values.
TI  - Low rates of antimicrobial resistance in respiratory pathogens from a pediatric population in north-eastern Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes are the main agents of bacterial upper respiratory tract infections in infants and children. In the past decades, the proportion of patients infected with drug-resistant organisms has increased; surveying at a regional level is important for understanding the size of the problem and elaborating therapeutic guidelines based on local epidemiology. METHODS: Since 1997, all isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes have been surveyed for antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: In our zone, we found 3.5% penicillin-resistant and 18% macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 15.8% ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and 24.8% erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) in our area does not represent a real concern; conversely, macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae is relatively frequent. Resistance to ampicillin in Haemophilus influenzae in our area seems relatively low, due to beta-lactamase production. Even for Streptococcus pyogenes, macrolide resistance rates in our region are relatively low if compared with other countries and other italian regions. In conclusion, in our area penicillins are still the first choice drugs, at least in noncomplicated or not recurrent infections.
TI  - Complement resistance mechanisms of streptococci.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes), group B streptococcus (GBS,  Streptococcus agalactiae) and pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) are all human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. These related species cause different spectra of infections spanning from trivial upper respiratory tract or skin infections to septic and severe diseases. In order to cause deep infections and survive in the human body the bacteria must evade the immune system. Complement is an important part of innate immunity both as an opsonizing and membrane destructing cascade and as an effector system of antibodies. In this review, we describe the complement resistance mechanisms of the three clinically most important streptococcal species, groups A and B streptococci and pneumococcus. The complement evasion mechanisms of these three species are analogous, yet different from one another. Several strains of all three species express molecules (M-proteins, Bac or beta, PspC) that acquire host fluid-phase complement regulators factor H or C4b binding protein to their surfaces. Groups A and B streptococci also secrete proteins and/or enzymes that inhibit the activation of the complement system or chemotaxis caused by the complement activation products. Even though a lot is known about the immune evasion by streptococci, the high morbidity and mortality associated with infections caused by streptococci and the need for efficient vaccines warrant further studies on the streptococcal molecules mediating complement resistance.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) production by the normal flora of the nasopharynx: potential to protect against otitis media?
AB  - The normal bacterial flora of the upper airways provides an important barrier to  invading pathogens. This study investigated the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) by streptococci isolated from the nasopharyngeal flora of children who either do or do not experience recurrent acute otitis media (AOM). Twenty children with recurrent AOM and 15 controls were tested. Swabs from the nasopharynx were evaluated for streptococci having BLIS activity against two representative strains of each of the AOM pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococci displaying strong BLIS activity were characterized further and tested for known streptococcal bacteriocin structural genes. Sixty-five per cent of children had nasopharyngeal streptococcal isolates that were inhibitory to strains of one or more of the AOM pathogens. Six children (17 %) had streptococci that demonstrated strong BLIS activity against strains of at least three of the pathogenic species. Three of these inhibitory isolates were Streptococcus salivarius, two were S. pneumoniae and one was S. pyogenes. The inhibitory S. salivarius and S. pyogenes were shown to have structural genes for known streptococcal bacteriocins. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups of children with respect to the presence of inhibitory streptococci in their nasopharyngeal floras. The finding of S. salivarius with strong inhibitory activity against several AOM pathogens in the nasopharyngeal flora of children is unique. Although there is no clear evidence from the present study that these organisms protect against AOM, their low pathogenicity and strong in-vitro BLIS production capability indicate that they should be incorporated in future trials of bacteriotherapy for recurrent AOM.
TI  - Comparative activity of telithromycin against typical community-acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Major bacterial pathogens in RTIs, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, have exhibited increasing resistance to a variety of antibiotics during the past decades. Telithromycin, the first ketolide, was designed especially to overcome this resistance. The present study was conducted to assess the comparative activity of telithromycin against typical RTI pathogens in Austria. METHODS: A total of 1,015 bacterial isolates was tested, including S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. MICs of the following antimicrobials: penicillin G, ampicillin (for H. influenzae), azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin A and telithromycin were determined using the NCCLS broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Telithromycin showed excellent activity against S. pneumoniae, with 99.8% of all isolates being susceptible. Penicillin remained active with an MIC50 and MIC90 of 0.007 mg/L. Nevertheless, a notable increase in penicillin intermediate-resistant and resistant isolates, from 4.9% in 1996 to the present rate of 10%, was observed. There was also a distinct rise in the resistance levels of S. pneumoniae against the macrolides. All tested isolates of S. pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin and telithromycin, and only low levels of resistance against telithromycin were found in S. aureus (2.2%, MIC90 of 0.5 mg/L). No telithromycin-resistant isolate of H. influenzae could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the rising prevalence of resistance among S. pneumoniae not only to penicillin but also to other antimicrobials. It also shows the value of telithromycin as an attractive option for the empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs in an era of widespread antibacterial resistance.
TI  - [Two cases of severe community-acquired pleural pneumonia due to Streptococcus pyogenes].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The microorganisms incriminated in severe community-acquired pneumonia hospitalized in intensive care unit are the following: Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteria isolated in aspiration-related pneumonia and less frequently intracellular bacteria in so-called atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila). CASE REPORTS: We report two cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted in intensive care unit and due to Lancefield Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Despite the increased incidence of invasive streptococcal infections, this microorganism still has a rare causative role in the pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. The case reports concern two young patients without any significant medical history and with many clinical, radiological and microbiological similarities. However, the prognosis was not the same because of the way the initial management has been provided. DISCUSSION: Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus could be a causative microorganism of severe and possibly fulminating community-acquired pneumonia, even in young and healthy patients as is the case with pneumococcal infections. Medical history, clinical symptoms and radiological signs should be taken into account to evoke the diagnosis and to initiate antibiotherapy early, taking into account that this microorganism is sensitive to Penicillin G.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little attention has been given to acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) caused by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS), although up to 10% of cases are caused by this microorganism. The objective of this study was to define the clinical and laboratory characteristics of AHO caused by GABHS. METHODS: Between January 1983 and June 1999, 29 patients were treated at Children's National Medical Center with AHO caused by GABHS. The characteristics of these patients were compared with those of 28 patients with AHO caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and those of a matched sample of 45 patients with AHO caused by Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Median ages of children with GABHS, S pneumoniae, and S aureus AHO were 36.0, 13.7, and 96.0 months, respectively. On admission, patients with GABHS AHO had a mean temperature of 38.9 +/- 1.3 degrees C and a mean white blood cell count of 17 000 +/- 7800/mm3, findings similar to those from patients with S pneumoniae AHO. Patients with S aureus AHO had significantly lower admission temperature (38.1 +/- 1.1 degrees C) and white blood cell count (10 600 +/- 4900/mm3). Varicella infection was the risk factor in 5 cases (17%) of GABHS AHO, whereas none of the cases of AHO caused by S pneumoniae and S aureus was associated with varicella infection. Adjacent septic arthritis occurred in 22%, 28%, and 61% of children with GABHS, S aureus, and S pneumoniae AHO, respectively. Admission erythrocyte sedimentation rate and frequency of bacteremia were similar in all groups. However, time to normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate was longer for GABHS and S aureus than for S pneumoniae AHO. GABHS, like S pneumoniae, affected fewer nonextremity bones compared with S aureus. CONCLUSIONS: GABHS should be considered in preschool- and early school-aged children who are suspected of having AHO and whose clinical and laboratory features are characterized by high fever and marked leukocytosis. It should also be highly considered in any child with AHO associated with varicella infection.
TI  - [The Viriato Study: update of antimicrobial susceptibility data of bacterial pathogens from community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Portugal in 2001 and 2002].
AB  - The Viriato Study is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter surveillance study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Portugal. In years 2001 and 2002, 31 laboratories participated in the study with a total of 2,600 strains, with testing undertaken in a central laboratory. Of the 486 Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from patients with acute tonsillitis all were susceptible to penicillin and other beta-lactams but 21.6% were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. From patients with lower respiratory tract infection 1,071 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 811 of Haemophilus influenzae, and 232 of Moraxella catarrhalis were studied. Among S. pneumoniae isolates 23% were resistant to penicillin (6.7% showing high-level resistance), 9.1% to cefuroxime, 1.0% to amoxycillin, 12.5% to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin, 10.9% to tetracycline, 29.8% to co-trimoxazol, and 3.0% to ofloxacin. Beta-lactamase was produced by 13.1% of H. influenzae and 94.4% of M. catarrhalis. In H. influenzae resistance to clarithromycin was 12.5% and to co-trimoxazole 15%. Most strains were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, azithromycin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. In M. catarrhalis resistance to co-trimoxazole was 25%. All strains were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. As verified in previous years of the Viriato Study, penicillin was the most active antimicrobial against S. pyogenes and amoxycillin/clavulanate the most active in vitro simultaneously against H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis isolated from patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection in Portugal.
TI  - Antibacterial resistance of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens recovered from patients in Latin America: results from the PROTEKT surveillance study (1999-2000).
AB  - PROTEKT (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin) is a global surveillance study established in 1999 to monitor antibacterial resistance of respiratory tract organisms. Thirteen centers from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico participated during 1999-2000; they collected 1806 isolates (Streptococcus pneumoniae 518, Haemophilus influenzae 520, Moraxella catarrhalis 140, Staphylococcus aureus 351, S. pyogenes 277). Overall, 218 (42.1%) of the S. pneumoniae isolates had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 79 (15.3%) were penicillin-resistant and 79 (15.3%) were erythromycin-resistant. Mexico had the highest prevalence of penicillin (76.5%) and erythromycin (31.2%) resistance. Of 77 erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae tested for resistance genotype, 43 possessed mef(A), 33 possessed erm(B) and 1 possessed both erm(B) and mef(A) mechanism. All S. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to telithromycin, linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin. Among H. influenzae isolates, 88 (16.9%) produced beta-lactamase, ranging from 11% (Brazil) to 24.5% (Mexico). Among M. catarrhalis isolates, 138 (98.6%) produced beta-lactamase. Twenty-four (8.7%) of the S. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin-resistant; resistance being attributable to mefA (n=18), ermTR (n=5) and ermB (n=1). All H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pyogenes were fully susceptible to telithromycin. Methicillin resistance was found in 26.5% of the S. aureus isolates (Argentina 15%; Mexico 20%; Brazil 31.3%). Telithromycin was effective against 97.7% of methicillin-susceptible isolates. PROTEKT confirms that antibacterial resistance is an emerging problem in Latin America. The previously reported high levels of pneumococcal resistance to the beta-lactam and macrolides were exceeded. New agents that do not induce resistance or that exert low selective pressure, e.g. telithromycin, are essential to safeguard future antibacterial efficacy.
TI  - Incidence and etiologies of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children, 1996 to 2001.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and causative organisms associated with complicated parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia are likely to have changed during the past several years. METHODS: Data regarding clinical and laboratory features were abstracted retrospectively from medical records of 76 subjects with complicated parapneumonic effusions at a tertiary children's hospital from 1996 through 2001. Incidence rates per 10 000 hospital discharges and per 1000 patients with nonviral pneumonia were calculated. RESULTS: Etiologic organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (31 subjects), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (5), Abiotrophia sp. (1) and no culture-confirmed agent (32). The annual incidence of complicated parapneumonic effusions per 10 000 discharges progressively increased from 4.5 in 1996 to 25.0 in 1999 (P = 0.0001), then declined to 10.1 in 2001 (P = 0.03). Similarly the incidence per 1000 cases of nonviral pneumonia increased from 2.9 in 1996 to 11.0 in 1999 (P = 0.003) and then declined to 4.8 in 2001 (P = 0.053). Whereas S. pneumoniae was the leading confirmed etiology in each year, the proportion of cases caused by Staphylococcus aureus increased from 6% in 1996 to 2000 (all of which were methicillin-susceptible) to 30% in 2001 (all methicillin-resistant; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia increased from 1996 to 1999 and then declined concomitant with the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Although cases caused by S. pneumoniae have decreased, community onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a cause of pneumonia with complicated effusions in children.
TI  - Bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of high dose amoxicillin for therapy of acute otitis media in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High dose (70 to 90 mg/kg/day) amoxicillin is recommended as first line therapy of acute otitis media (AOM) in geographic areas where drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is prevalent. Information on the bacteriologic efficacy of high dose amoxicillin treatment for AOM is limited. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of high dose amoxicillin as first line therapy in AOM. METHODS: In a prospective study 50 culture-positive patients ages 3 to 22 months (median, 9 months; 77% <1 year) were treated with high dose amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/day three times a day for 10 days) No antibiotics were administered 72 h before enrollment. Twenty-four (48%) patients presented with their first episode of AOM. Middle ear fluid was cultured by tympanocentesis at enrollment and on Days 4 to 6 of therapy. Additional middle ear fluid cultures were obtained if clinical relapse occurred. Bacteriologic failure was defined by positive cultures on Days 4 to 6 and clinical failure by no change or worsening of AOM signs and symptoms and requirement for additional antibiotics during therapy and/or at end of therapy. Patients were followed until Day 28 +/- 2. Susceptibility to penicillin and amoxicillin was measured by E-test. RESULTS: Sixty-five organisms were recovered at enrollment: Haemophilus influenzae (38), Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Streptococcus pyogenes (2) and Moraxella catarrhalis (1). Eighteen (75%) S. pneumoniae were nonsusceptible to penicillin (MIC > 0.1 microg/ml). All 24 S. pneumoniae isolates had amoxicillin MIC < or = 2.0 microg/ml. Thirteen (34%) of the 38 H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Eradication was achieved in 41 (82%) patients for 54 of 65 (83%) pathogens: 22 of 24 (92%) S. pneumoniae, 21 of 25 (84%) beta-lactamase-negative H. influenzae, 8 of 13 (62%) beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae, 2 of 2 S. pyogenes and 1 of 1 M. catarrhalis. Seven organisms not initially present were isolated on Days 4 to 6 in 5 patients: 3 beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae; 1 beta-lactamase-negative H. influenzae; 2 S. pneumoniae; and 1 M. catarrhalis. In total 14 of 50 (28%) patients failed bacteriologically on Days 4 to 6 (persistence + new infection), of whom 9 (64%) had beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae. Three (33%) of the 9 patients with bacteriologic failure (2 beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae, 1 S. pneumoniae) failed also clinically on Days 4 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant pathogens isolated from children with AOM failing high dose amoxicillin therapy were beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Because its overall clinical efficacy is good, high dose amoxicillin is still an appropriate choice as first line empiric therapy for AOM, followed by a beta-lactamase-stable drug in the event of failure.
TI  - Bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis compared with bacteremic cellulitis caused by  Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - In order to better characterize bacteremic cellulitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a review was conducted of 10 cases of bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis, which represented 0.9% of all cases of pneumococcal bacteremia (n=1,076) and 3.2% of all cases of community-acquired bacteremic cellulitis (n=312) that occurred in the Hospital de Bellvitge, Barcelona, from 1984 to 2001. In addition to these 10 cases, 28 cases of bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis from the literature (Medline 1975-2001) were reviewed. Pneumococcal cellulitis of the face, neck, and trunk was observed more frequently in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and hematologic disorders, while pneumococcal cellulitis of the limbs was more common in patients with diabetes, alcoholism, and parenteral drug use. In the Hospital de Bellvitge group, bacteremic cellulitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae was more frequently associated with severe underlying diseases than that due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes (100%, 57%, and 72%, respectively;P=0.01). A concomitant extracutaneous focus of infection (e.g., respiratory tract infection) suggesting hematogenous spread with metastatic cellulitis was more frequent in patients with pneumococcal cellulitis, while a local cutaneous entry of microorganisms was feasible in most patients with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis. The 30-day mortality was 10% in patients with pneumococcal cellulitis, 13% in patients with Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis, and 23% in patients with Streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis (P=0.3). Thus, bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis is an unusual manifestation of pneumococcal disease and occurs mainly in patients with severe underlying diseases. In most cases, pneumococcal cellulitis has a different pathophysiologic mechanism than cellulitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Amoxicillin-sulbactam: A clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  - Combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. This means that they are an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. The amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against Gram-positive cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), Gram-negative cocci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis and others), Gram-negative bacilli (nonhospital strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. Its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis). It is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. It is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. The new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. In summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children. (c) 2001 Prous Science. All rights reserved.

TI  - Synthesis of 9-oxime-11,12-carbamate ketolides through a novel N-deamination reaction of 11,12-hydrazonocarbamate ketolide.
AB  - A series of 9-oxime-11,12-carbamate ketolides was synthesized for the first time  through a key 11,12-hydrazonocarbamate intermediate that was first oximated and further deaminated to give the corresponding carbamate. The N-N bond cleavage was achieved through an original new reaction using glycoaldehyde dimer as deaminating reagent. The new compounds synthesized were shown to display improved antibacterial activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes resistant to erythromycin.
TI  - [Cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  - As a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. Cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; Activity against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter and Klebsiella species; Low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; Minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. Its spectrum is very large being very active against Gram-negative bacilii: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis and less active against Bacillus fragillis. Cefepime is also very active against Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; Enterococcus is resistant. Due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases Cefepime (Maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. Cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  - Between September and December 2001 in the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic of Bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. Introduced in therapy in the last decade of the XXth Century, Cefepime (Maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. Cefepime (Maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus fragillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Citrobacter and other Gram-negative bacilii, Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). The clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. We introduced Cefepime (Maxipime) as first choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with metronidazole. The results of our study support the utilization of Cefepime (Maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. Cefepime (Maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens in North America in 1999-2000: findings of the PROTEKT surveillance study.
AB  - The PROTEKT surveillance study commenced in 1999 to examine the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory pathogens. We report here the results from 2371 isolates collected during 2000 by North American centers (Canada, n = 7; USA, n = 8). Overall, 21.3% of pneumococci (n = 687) were penicillin G-resistant (Canada, 10.3%; USA, 32.6%). Corresponding rates of erythromycin resistance were 16.3% and 31.5%. Telithromycin inhibited all penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant isolates at < or =1 microg/ml. Among 612 Hemophilus influenzae isolates, 22.4% were beta-lactamase-positive. Antimicrobial susceptibility of H. influenzae varied between 82.4% (clarithromycin) and 100% (cefpodoxime, levofloxacin). Importantly, one isolate was found to be resistant to both moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Most Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were highly susceptible to the antimicrobials tested, except ampicillin. All Streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 382) were penicillin-susceptible and 5.2% were non-susceptible to erythromycin. S. pyogenes showed cross-resistance to other macrolides yet remained inhibited by telithromycin at < or =0.5 microg/ml. Methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus was common (19.9%), particularly in the USA. The PROTEKT study confirms the widespread prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens in North America, and hence the need for continued surveillance to guide optimal empiric therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - A novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 88: overexpression, purification, and characterization of unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of Bacillus sp. GL1.
AB  - Unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of Bacillus sp. GL1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced through the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate, and chondroitin lyases. An overexpression system for the enzyme was constructed in Escherichia coli cells involving regulation of the enzyme gene under the T7 promoter and terminator. The expression level of the enzyme in E. coli cells was 250-fold higher than that in Bacillus sp. GL1 cells. The enzyme expressed in E. coli cells was purified and characterized. The optimal pH and temperature, and substrate specificity of the purified enzyme were similar to those of the native enzyme from Bacillus sp. GL1 cells, although the enzyme expressed in E. coli cells underwent self-assembly into polymeric forms through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme was rich in alpha-helices. Genes showing high identity (over 40% identity) with that of the enzyme were found in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause serious diseases (e.g., meningitis and pneumonia). Therefore, the enzyme of Bacillus sp. GL1 and the streptococcal proteins form a new glycoside hydrolase family, 88.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - National surveillance programme on susceptibility patterns of respiratory pathogens in South Africa: moxifloxacin compared with eight other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - AIMS: The susceptibility patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from specimens submitted to 12 private laboratories in South Africa were determined. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations were performed on the isolates in the microbiology laboratory at Tygerberg Hospital according to the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). RESULTS: According to the NCCLS breakpoints, 24% of 729 S pneumoniae isolates were sensitive, 30% intermediate, and 46% resistant to penicillin. Rates of macrolide resistance were high, with 61% of the pneumococci being resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin. Co-trimoxazole resistance was also high, with 28% of pneumococcal strains being sensitive, 21% intermediate, and 51% resistant. beta Lactamase was produced by 7% of 736 H influenzae isolates and 91% of 256 M catarrhalis isolates. The quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were universally active against all isolates tested, which included S pneumoniae, H influenzae, M catarrhalis, K pneumoniae, and S pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus influenzae and S pneumoniae were the most commonly isolated organisms. Resistance to penicillin was one of the highest reported in the world (76%) in S pneumoniae, as was macrolide resistance in pneumonocci, although surprisingly, only 14% of S pyogenes were resistant. The quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were active against all organisms tested, including the penicillin and macrolide resistant strains and moxifloxacin was more active than levofloxacin against pneumococci.
TI  - Resistance pattern of bacteria isolated from acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) cases.
AB  - Out of 350 acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) patients 110 (31.4%) were positive on culture. Among then (35.5%) yielded from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and 64.5% yielded from lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Predominant bacterial isolates from URI were Staph aureus (12.4%) and Strepto. pyogen (9.8%) whereas predominant agent from LRI were Strepto. pneumoniae (14.7%) and Haemophilus influenzae (8.6%). Capsular typing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and type specific antisera revealed that 64.7% of the isolates were type-b and rest were non-b. The most frequent resistance pattern of H. influenzae was found resistant to penicillin-ampicillin (64.7%) followed by SMX-TMP (14.7%) and tetracycline (5.9%). Among penicillin-ampicillin resistant strains, 81.8% were beta lectamase positive and 18.2% were beta lectamase negative. Among beta lectamase positive strains 66.7% were capsular type-b and 33.3% were non-b, had MICS < or = 8 microgram/ml. and < or = 4 microgram/ml. respectively. 5.9% strains of Strepto. pneumoniae was found resistant to SMX-TMP, 5.9% to penicillin-ampicillin and 2.9% to cephalexin. Common resistance pattern of Staph aureus was penicillin-ampicillin (60%), SMX-TMP (37.2%) and tetracycline-erythromycine-cephalexin (11.4%). Strepto. pyogen was found resistant to tetracycline in 12.2% cases and to SMX-TMP in 8.3% cases.
TI  - Colonization of burn wounds in Ain Shams University Burn Unit.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out on 70 burned patients admitted to the Burn Unit, Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, with the aim to verify the pattern of microbial colonization of burn wounds. Throughout the study period starting from 1 June 1999 till 31 May 2001, 281 sampling procedures (surface swabs) were performed from the burn wounds. A total of 301 microbial isolates were grown in cultures. Eight different species of bacteria, and only one species of Candida (C. albicans) were detected. There was no incidence of recovery of anaerobic microorganisms. Our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.6%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.2%), then Escherichia coli (13.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (11.6%), Streptococcus pyogenes (8.3%), Enterobacter species (6.6%), and lastly Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans (5.9 and 3.6%, respectively). Studying the time-related changes in burn wound microbial colonization showed an initial predominance of gram-positive cocci upon admission (70.7%) over gram-negative bacilli (27.6%). During the first 5 days, gram-negative bacilli started to predominate (55.7%) over gram-positive cocci (40.3%). Burn wound sampling performed starting from the sixth day onwards, revealed further prevalence of gram-negative bacilli (72.7%) over gram-positive cocci (22.7%). As for Candida albicans, there was a gradual increase in the frequency of its recovery as time elapsed from admission. It is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This would enable early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall infection-related morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Quantitative detection of Moraxella catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal secretions by real-time PCR.
AB  - The recognition of Moraxella catarrhalis as an important cause of respiratory tract infections has been protracted, mainly because it is a frequent commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract and the diagnostic sensitivity of blood or pleural fluid culture is low. Given that the amount of M. catarrhalis bacteria in the upper respiratory tract may change during infection, quantification of these bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs) by real-time PCR may offer a suitable diagnostic approach. Using primers and a fluorescent probe specific for the copB outer membrane protein gene, we detected DNA from serial dilutions of M. catarrhalis cells corresponding to 1 to 10(6) cells. Importantly, there was no difference in the amplification efficiency when the same DNA was mixed with DNA from NPSs devoid of M. catarrhalis. The specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by the lack of amplification of DNAs from other Moraxella species, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, H. influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and various Neisseria species. The assay applied to NPSs from 184 patients with respiratory tract infections performed with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of up to 98% compared to the culture results. The numbers of M. catarrhalis organisms detected by real-time PCR correlated with the numbers detected by semiquantitative culture. This real-time PCR assay targeting the copB outer membrane protein gene provided a sensitive and reliable means for the rapid detection and quantification of M. catarrhalis in NPSs; may serve as a tool to study changes in the amounts of M. catarrhalis during lower respiratory tract infections or following vaccination against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or N. meningitidis; and may be applied to other clinical samples.
TI  - Current status of bacterial resistance in the otolaryngology field: results from  the Second Nationwide Survey in Japan.
AB  - The study reported here was a nationwide assessment of otitis media (466 patients with acute suppurative otitis media and 476 with chronic suppurative otitis media), sinusitis (447 with acute sinusitis and 426 with chronic sinusitis), acute tonsillitis (724 patients), and peritonsillar abscess (141 patients) performed between November 1998 and March 1999. Eighty university hospitals, 79 affiliated hospitals, and 103 general practitioners participated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) comprised 15.6% of the 786 isolated strains of S. aureus. MRSA was frequently detected in patients with suppurative otitis media, but was uncommon in those with acute tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess, and it was more common in those who had already been treated than in those who had not, with a significant difference between the groups. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest antimicrobial activity against MRSA and no VCM resistance was detected. Penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae(PSSP), penicillin-intermediate-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) accounted for 49.6%, 28.5%, and 21.9% of the 228 isolated strains of S. pneumoniae, respectively. PISP and PRSP were frequently detected in children aged 5 years or younger. beta-Lactamase was produced by 96 of the 100 strains (96%) of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The 281 strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolated consisted of 199 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-sensitive (BLNASe) strains (70.8%), 65 beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains (23.1%), and 17 beta-lactamase-producing strains (6.0%). BLNAR strains were frequently detected in pretreated patients. Of these 281 strains of H. influenzae, 214 had nontypable capsules. In conclusion, the major bacterial species showed resistance to beta-lactams, indicating that care should be taken when selecting an appropriate antimicrobial agent.
TI  - [The role of IVIG in treatment of generalized infections].
AB  - In the research basing on data of literature we showed opinions on the subject of using IVIG in treatment of sepsis and of septic shock, especially in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - How contagious are common respiratory tract infections?
AB  
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children.
AB  - Little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. Increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in South Africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the United States. This study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. Middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. While 92 per cent of the children had recently received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (nine), Staphylococcus aureus (six), Moraxella catarrhalis (two), Streptococcus pyogenes (two) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). Two isolates were identified in each of eight children. Antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35 (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. The pneumococcal serotypes found were 19F (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23F (23 per cent), 6B (nine per cent), 19A (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). Children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months) than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). Isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (OR = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (OR = 7.72, p = 0.03). Almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a leading pathogen.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute mastoiditis is a serious bacterial infection of the temporal bone and is the most common complication of otitis media. The goal of this study is to assess the clinical features, pathogens, management, and outcome of acute mastoiditis in children in northern Israel. METHODS: A systematic review of medical records of all children who were admitted with acute mastoiditis from January 1990 through December 2000. RESULTS: Fifty-seven children were included. Median was age: 36 months. In 26 patients (45.6%) mastoiditis complicated the first episode of acute otitis media (AOM). Twenty-five children (44%) received antibiotic treatment prior to admission. Frequent symptoms included mastoid area erythema in 54 children (94.7%), proptosis of the auricle in 52 children (91.2%) and fever in 43 children (75.4%). Middle ear, and subperiostal culture yielded growth of pathogen in 30 children (75%), two cultures yielded more then one pathogen. The most frequent pathogens were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 10 children (25%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in eight children (20%), Group A streptococcus in six children (15%). The highest incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in children who did not suffer from AOM before admission (35 vs. 5%). Fifty-two (91.2%) children were cured with antibiotic treatment alone. Seventeen children underwent computed tomography (CT) of the mastoid. Mastoid bone destruction was demonstrated in six children and subperiostal abscess in eight. Mastoidectomy was performed in five children. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of acute mastoiditis can be made on clinical basis alone requiring CT only when complications are suspected. Half of the children admitted with acute mastoiditis had no previous history of recurrent AOM. In those children S. pneumoniae was the leading pathogen while P. aeruginosa was more prevalent in children with recurrent AOM. Most of the children recovered with medical therapy alone, without surgical intervention.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Zingiber officinale and Garcinia kola on respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity of Zingiber officinale (ginger) Garcinia kola (bitter kola) on four respiratory tract pathogens. DESIGN: A prospective study based on laboratory investigations. SETTING: Department of Life Sciences, University of Buea. Throat swabs were collected from 333 individuals with running nostrils, cough and/or catarrh in three localities of Buea namely Bokwango, Molyko and Bolifamba. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were isolated from the specimens using standard microbiological procedures. The antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts of ginger and bitter kola, were investigated on these pathogens using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays. RESULTS: The extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against the pathogens. The MIC of extracts ranged from 0.0003 microg/ml to 0.7 microg/ml for ginger and 0.00008 microg/ml, to 1.8 microg/mL for bitter kola, while MBC ranged from 0.1.35 microg/ml to 2.04 microg/ml for ginger and 0.135 microg/ml to 4.2 microg/ml for bitter kola. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that extracts of ginger root and bitter kola may contain compounds with therapeutic activity.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by unusual gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Of a total of 81 patients hospitalized in the infectious diseases department in 1990-2000 with infectious endocarditis caused by Gram-positive pathogen, unusual etiological agents were found in several cases: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gemella morbillorum. Cardiac defects were present in the latter two patients: bicuspid aortic valve and tetralogy of Fallot. Two patients were successfully treated with antibiotics only and one patient with antibiotics and surgery. The patient with C. diphtheriae endocarditis died due to progressive sepsis and multiple organ failure.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Oral streptogramins in the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in debilitated patients are difficult to treat. We studied the clinical efficacy and safety of an oral streptogramin, pristinamycin, for these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were admitted consecutively to receive pristinamycin, usually with doxycycline, for 7-21 days. Fifty-six patients (average age 75 years) from hospital and community were treated for skin, soft tissue, chest and other infections. RESULTS: The overall clinical response rate was 39 of 53 patients (74%; 95% CI: 60%, 85%) cured or substantially improved, from 53 of 56 (95%) patients clinically and 49 of 56 (87.5%) patients bacteriologically evaluable. Toxic effects comprised gastrointestinal disturbances in eight patients (14%) and one (2%) possible skin rash. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that oral streptogramins may be useful in the management of debilitated patients with MRSA infections.
TI  - Acute septic arthritis of the hip in children in northern Australia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology, microbiology and clinical management of all children under 15 years of age presenting with acute septic arthritis of the hip to Royal Darwin Hospital from July 1994 to December 1999 were reviewed and the diagnostic value of various biological markers assessed. METHODS: Systematic review was undertaken of case notes of patients identified by searching the computerized hospital patient database and the admission records for the children's ward. RESULTS: Eleven cases were identified: 10 aboriginal and one caucasian. The mean temperature, white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) at presentation were 39.2 degrees C, 15,500/mL, 65 mm/h and 144 mg/L, respectively. All had ESR and/or CRP >20. Plain radiographs and ultrasonography were abnormal in 1/8 and 5/6 cases, respectively. Pathogens were isolated in nine cases: Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1). Patients received intravenous antibiotics for 8.6 days (range: 3-15 days) and subsequent oral antibiotics for 22 days (range: 0-42 days). The mean (range) time from hospital admission to arthrotomy; from hospital admission to antibiotic administration; and the overall hospital stay was 23 h (range: 3-48 h); 6 h (range: 0-48 h); and 41 days (range: 6-110 days), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of temperature, white cell count, ESR and CRP were useful indicators of septic arthritis but initial diagnosis must be made on a clinical basis. Many patients had to be transferred from regional aboriginal communities and there was significant delay from onset of symptoms to arthrotomy.
TI  - [Update on the susceptibility of streptococci to antibiotics (enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae excluded)].
AB  - Over the last years, the emergence of resistance to antibiotics has complicated the management of streptococcal infections. The resistance of streptococci to antibiotics is increasing and seems to be linked to the consumption of antibiotics. Resistances to antibiotics have been noted in all species of streptococci and no family of antibiotics is unaffected by resistances. The incidence of resistance to antibiotics varies from one species to another and according to countries. Presently, even though no Streptococcus pyogenes has shown diminished susceptibility to betalactams, this phenomenon has been reported for some strains in the B, C, and G groups, and for up to 56 % of oral streptococci. As for the resistance to macrolides, it reaches as many as 41 % of Streptococcus pyogenes, 46 % of group B streptococci, and 63 % of oral streptococci responsible for severe infections. This evolution is worrying for all streptococci but particularly for oral streptococci which represent a potential reservoir of virulence genes, notably towards Streptococcus pneumoniae. New families of antibiotics as the ketolides or the oxazolidinones appear to be effective in the treatment of streptococcal infections, but it seems that only a policy of control of the consumption of antibiotics could globally decrease the occurrence of resistance.
TI  - Naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary IgA levels.
AB  - Lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. Since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. A study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary IgA directed against surface antigens bacteria frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Streptococcus pyogenes (SPy), Morraxella catarrhalis (MC), Haemophylus influenzae (HI), and Streptococcus pnumoniae (SPn). In 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific IgA antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. In the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had IgA directed, respectively, to KP and SA, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. We found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary IgA in the adult than in the pediatric population for all the microorganism evaluated. In addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific IgA at oropharingeal level was KP. Interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. Nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (Ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. These results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.
TI  - [In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory pathogens in Latin America].
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and six other antibiotics frequently used in respiratory tract infections, against 1563 Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis clinical isolates from 21 centers in 10 Latin American countries from March 2000 to April 2001. Moxifloxacin was the most active compound against all the species included. Moxifloxacin was 2- to 4-fold more active than levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. This difference was much higher against levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC: 0.5 mg/l vs 8 mg/l). The activity of moxifloxacin against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was similar to levofloxacin; all the isolates were inhibited at < or = 1 mg/l concentrations of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin.
TI  - Synthesis of new 14-membered macrolide antibiotics via a novel ring contraction metathesis.
AB  - [reaction: see text] A novel ring opening ring closing metathesis (ROM-RCM) was demonstrated for cyclic conjugated dienes, effecting the excision of a C(2)H(2) unit and a net ring contraction. Applying the ring contraction metathesis, new 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotics were synthesized in a single step from existing 16-membered ring macrolides. This new class of macrolide antibiotics will provide access to new therapeutics for the treatment of macrolide-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing community-acquired respiratory infections in Spain: the SAUCE project.
AB  - Multicentre surveillance is essential in order to monitor the prevalence of certain resistance phenotypes and to identify rapidly the emergence of new ones. However, many surveillance studies are based either on a relatively small number of isolates from a single country, or on a large number of isolates from many different countries and so are not equally meaningful. Extensive national multicentre surveillance would provide a more reliable strategy for assessing the extent of antimicrobial resistance in individual countries. This article describes Spanish experience with the surveillance network SAUCE, and summarizes the main results on antimicrobial resistance in the three key bacterial pathogens involved in community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Spain: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: a class effect?
AB  - Antibiotic use has led to increased resistance to certain group markers: penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin for beta-lactams, macrolides and quinolones, respectively. The influence of resistance to markers in decreasing susceptibility to the drugs included (on the basis of chemical structure) in the corresponding antibiotic group can be defined as 'resistance class effect'. In the case of macrolides, this effect is dependent on the prevalent resistant phenotype among the isolates of the target bacteria: the class effect exists completely if the mechanism of resistance is constitutive MLS(B) (all macrolides are affected by resistance to erythromycin), and only partially if the mechanism is the efflux M phenotype (all but 16-membered macrolides are affected). In Spain, the first case is exemplified by Streptococcus pneumoniae and the second by Streptococcus pyogenes. For beta-lactams and quinolones, resistance to the group markers results in large decreases in the antimicrobial activity of the less potent members of the group, penicillin being a better driver of resistance for oral cephalosporins than for aminopenicillins, and ciprofloxacin being a better driver for older rather than for the newer quinolones, which have enhanced anti-pneumococcal activity. Empirical prescription guidelines based on the pharmacoepidemiology of resistance, recommending the use of potent drugs that are less influenced by resistance to the marker, may help to counter the spread of resistance in the community.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes in the pediatric population in Germany during 2000-2001.
AB  - In a nationwide study in Germany covering 13 clinical microbiology laboratories,  a total of 307 Streptococcus pyogenes (mainly pharyngitis) and 333 Streptococcus pneumoniae (respiratory tract infections) strains were collected from outpatients less than 16 years of age. The MICs of penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin A, clindamycin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin were determined by the microdilution method. In S. pyogenes isolates, resistance rates were as follows: penicillin, 0%; erythromycin A, 13.7%; and levofloxacin, 0%. Telithromycin showed good activity against S. pyogenes isolates (MIC(90) = 0.25 micro g/ml; MIC range, 0.016 to 16 micro g/ml). Three strains were found to be telithromycin-resistant (MIC >/= 4 micro g/ml). Erythromycin-resistant strains were characterized for the underlying resistance genotype, with 40.5% having the efflux type mef(A), 38.1% having the erm(A), and 9.5% having the erm(B) genotypes. emm typing of macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes isolates showed emm types 4 (45.2%), 77 (26.2%), and 12 (11.9%) to be predominant. In S. pneumoniae, resistance rates were as follows: penicillin intermediate, 7.5%; penicillin resistant, 0%; erythromycin A, 17.4%; and levofloxacin, 0%. Telithromycin was highly active against pneumococcal isolates (MIC(90) </= 0.016 micro g/ml; range, 0.016 to 0.5 micro g/ml). The overall resistance profile of streptococcal respiratory tract isolates is still favorable, but macrolide resistance is of growing concern in Germany.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of empyema.
AB  
TI  - Is antimicrobial resistance also subject to globalization?
AB  - In recent years one of the more alarming aspects of clinical microbiology has been the dramatic increase in the incidence of resistance to antibacterial agents among pathogens causing nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections. There are profound geographic differences in the incidence of resistance among pathogens of the respiratory tract, only some of which can be explained by the local use of antibiotics. A high percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains produce beta-lactamase and are thus resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics. In contrast, beta-lactamase production among strains of Haemophilus influenzae rarely reaches more than 30% around the world. Methicillin-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is a common and increasing problem in hospitals but its extent varies both locally and nationally. Resistance is usually associated with the local spread of resistant strains. High standards of hygiene in hospitals can prevent the spread of such strains but once established they can be difficult to eradicate. Although Streptococcus pyogenes remains highly susceptible to penicillins, even after many decades of their use, resistance to macrolides has occurred. This resistance can rise and fall. Although the increase of macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes can often be associated with an increase in the use of these drugs, this is not always so. In some cases it has been shown to be caused by the spread of one or more resistant clones. Eradication of these clones can reduce the level of resistance markedly. Resistance to both macrolides and penicillins among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae is seen world-wide but is highly variable from country to country. Local habits of drug usage may play a part. In Italy, for example, there is preference for the use of parenteral third-generation cephalosporins for some severe infections and there is a corresponding low level of penicillin-resistance among pneumococci.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of hypertrophied tonsils in children with secretory otitis media].
AB  - The potentially pathogenic bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major bacterial flora of hypertrophied tonsils. In children suffering from otitis media with inflammatory effusion an unfortunate decreased physiological flora of Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria is observed.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - [Therapy of acute mastoiditis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media is a common disease, mostly contracted at childhood. The development of acute mastoiditis has been decreased since the introduction of antibiotics. Currently it is only developed in 0.004 % cases of acute otitis media. But despite of this fact, even today one should not neglect this condition as the complications such as intracranial spread and lateral sinus thrombosis are still life threatening. METHODS AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective study from 01/96 - 09/00 we reviewed the cases of acute mastoiditis as a result of acute otitis media at our department. Additionally we compared study results out of 1972 until 1989 with our current results. RESULTS: Altogether mastoidectomy has been carried out at 157 patients. The cases have steadily increased since 1996. This is confirmed by comparison with study results of previous years. The majority of the patients were between 8 months and 3 years old (60 %). When the patients first presented at our department, the first signs of otitis media were 19.5 days ago in average. 38 % of the patients received no antibiotic treatment before admission. A thickened mucous membrane was seen by the mastoidectomy mostly (58 %). A subperiostal abscess we noted in 8.5 %. The most common isolated bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (33 %) and Streptococcus pyogenes (11 %). The patients stayed at the department about 10 days. In comparison to recent study results the "typical" mastoiditis has decreased. The causative pathogens have not changed. CONCLUSIONS: In the last years we realised an increasing number of mastoiditis at our department. The isolated bacteria are the same as presented in the literature. Early surgery combined with an effective antibiotic treatment can avoid the known complications of mastoiditis.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - Vaginal discharge due to undiagnosed bilateral duplicated collecting system with  ectopic ureters in a three-year-old female: an initial high index of suspicion for sexual abuse.
AB  - In prepubertal girls with vaginal discharge, consideration of the etiology must be given to respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis), enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Yersinia), poor hygiene, foreign body, nonabsorbent undergarments, irritants, vulvar skin disease, anatomic abnormalities (double vagina with fistula, pelvic abscess, and ectopic ureter), and sexual abuse. Prepubertal girls, outside the newborn period, with suspected gonococcal infection should be strongly considered to be victims of sexual abuse, once congenital and other newborn acquired forms of gonorrhea are excluded. We present a case of a three-year-old female with vaginal discharge and fever with a clouded social history, disproportionate distress on physical exam, and initial laboratory gram stain suggestive of gonococcus.
TI  - Genome analysis of an inducible prophage and prophage remnants integrated in the  Streptococcus pyogenes strain SF370.
AB  - The mitomycin C inducible prophage SF370.1 from the highly pathogenic M1 serotype Streptococcus pyogenes isolate SF370 showed a 41-kb-long genome whose genetic organization resembled that of SF11-like pac-site Siphoviridae. Its closest relative was prophage NIH1.1 from an M3 serotype S. pyogenes strain, followed by S. pneumoniae phage MM1 and Lactobacillus phage phig1e, Listeria phage A118, and Bacillus phage SPP1 in a gradient of relatedness. Sequence similarity with the previously described prophages SF370.2 and SF370.3 from the same polylysogenic SF370 strain were mainly limited to the tail fiber genes. As in these two other prophages, SF370.1 encoded likely lysogenic conversion genes between the phage lysin and the right attachment site. The genes encoded the pyrogenic exotoxin C of S. pyogenes and a protein sharing sequence similarity with both DNases and mitogenic factors. The screening of the SF370 genome revealed further prophage-like elements. A 13-kb-long phage remnant SF370.4 encoded lysogeny and DNA replication genes. A closely related prophage remnant was identified in S. pyogenes strain Manfredo at a corresponding genome position. The two prophages differed by internal indels and gene replacements. Four phage-like integrases were detected; three were still accompanied by likely repressor genes. All prophage elements were integrated into coding sequences. The phage sequences complemented the coding sequences in all cases. The DNA repair genes mutL and mutS were separated by the prophage remnant SF370.4; prophage SF370.1 and S. pneumoniae phage MM1 integrated into homologous chromosomal locations. The prophage sequences were interpreted with a hypothesis that predicts elements of cooperation and an arms race between phage and host genomes.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance: the Iowa experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past 10 years, the number of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other common respiratory pathogens that are resistant to penicillin has increased. OBJECTIVE: The Iowa Department of Public Health convened a multidisciplinary task force in January 1998 to develop strategies to combat antibiotic resistance in the state because they were alarmed by these reports. METHODS: Within 18 months, the task force implemented statewide surveillance of resistant organisms and posted information about the surveillance on the Internet, distributed a public health guide on judicious antibiotic use and infection control measures to 7500 healthcare providers, and held a press conference to inform the public about antibiotic resistance. The task force collaborated with several major insurers in the state to profile the top prescribers of antibiotic agents in their plan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The profiling and educational interventions led to a substantial decrease in both overall antibiotic prescribing and drug costs. Other states may want to undertake similar programs to help protect their citizens from infections caused by resistant pathogens.
TI  - Surveillance of resistance in bacteria causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics in community-acquired respiratory tract infections is a serious problem and is increasing in prevalence world-wide at an alarming rate. Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the main organisms implicated in respiratory tract infections, has developed multiple resistance mechanisms to combat the effects of most commonly used classes of antibiotics, particularly the beta-lactams (penicillin, aminopenicillins and cephalosporins) and macrolides. Furthermore, multidrug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae have spread to all regions of the world, often via resistant genetic clones. A similar spread of resistance has been reported for other major respiratory tract pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. To develop and support resistance control strategies it is imperative to obtain accurate data on the prevalence, geographic distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens and how this relates to antibiotic prescribing patterns. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing longitudinal national and international surveillance programs to monitor antibiotic resistance, such that the prevalence of resistance and underlying trends over time are now well documented for most parts of Europe, and many parts of Asia and the Americas. However, resistance surveillance data from parts of the developing world (regions of Central America, Africa, Asia and Central/Eastern Europe) remain poor. The quantity and quality of surveillance data is very heterogeneous; thus there is a clear need to standardize or validate the data collection, analysis and interpretative criteria used across studies. If disseminated effectively these data can be used to guide empiric antibiotic therapy, and to support-and monitor the impact of-interventions on antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of macrolide resistance in clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes from North America.
AB  - Resistance to macrolides is not a new phenomenon but it deserves attention because of the widespread use of these agents and their inclusion in many clinical guidelines for respiratory tract infections. The most common mechanisms by which Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes develop resistance to macrolides is by target site modification (erythromycin ribosome methylase, erm) and efflux of the drug out of the organisms (macrolide efflux, mef). Target site modification may be of greater concern because it confers high-level resistance to all antimicrobials in the macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminB (MLSB) group. The genotype profiles of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes differ somewhat across regions in the US and between the US and Canada and other countries. There is some evidence for an association between macrolide resistance and treatment failure but this must be researched more fully. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates resistant to macrolides are generally susceptible to ketolide antimicrobials because these agents bind more strongly to the relevant domain of the ribosomal subunit (withstanding erm resistance) and are less vulnerable to efflux compared to the macrolides.
TI  - What can PROTEKT tell us at a local level?
AB  - Because of increasing antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs), surveillance at local, regional, national and international levels is necessary to provide information to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy. PROTEKT (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin) is a longitudinal, global, multicenter surveillance study designed to monitor the worldwide development of antimicrobial resistance, and disseminate up-to-date information via the internet to assist in the choice of empiric therapy at the local level. In this paper, the results for the first year of PROTEKT are presented from a local perspective. In examples from Japan, USA and Europe, great variation was observed between antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae in countries and cities in close proximity to each other. Telithromycin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against all organisms and is a potential new candidate for the empiric therapy of CARTIs. The first year of PROTEKT has provided valuable information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents causing CARTIs that can be used for guiding empiric therapy and policies. Variation in local resistance observed in this study further emphasizes the need for accurate up-to-date surveillance data at the local level.
TI  - Global surveillance through PROTEKT: the first year.
AB  - The increasing antimicrobial resistance amongst bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs) necessitates surveillance at the local, regional, national and international levels to provide information to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy. PROTEKT (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin) is a longitudinal, global, multicenter surveillance study designed to monitor the worldwide development of antimicrobial resistance and disseminate up-to-date information via the internet to assist in the choice of empiric therapy at the local level. In this paper, the results for the first year of PROTEKT are presented from a global perspective. Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, are the principal organisms responsible for the majority of CARTIs. The global prevalence of penicillin G resistance in S. pneumoniae has risen to an alarming 36.3% (high-level resistance 22.1%, intermediate-level 14.2%) with the highest prevalence found in Asia (68%). In all regions, macrolide resistance is greater than penicillin G resistance with a global prevalence rate of 31.2%. High resistance rates were also found for tetracycline (30.5%) and co-trimoxazole (43.9%), and multiresistance was found between penicillin G, macrolides, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole. The prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was found to be similar to previous reports. Macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes was 0.3% overall. Telithromycin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against all organisms and is a potential new candidate for the empiric therapy of CARTIs. The first year of PROTEKT has provided valuable information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents causing CARTIs that can be used for guiding empiric therapy and policies. The rapidly developing and geographically varying resistance observed in this study further emphasizes the need for accurate up-to-date surveillance data.
TI  - A locus of group A Streptococcus involved in invasive disease and DNA transfer.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes diseases ranging from benign to severe infections such as necrotizing fasciitis (NF). The reasons for the differences in severity of streptococcal infections are unexplained. We developed the polymorphic-tag-lengths-transposon-mutagenesis (PTTM) method to identify virulence genes in vivo. We applied PTTM on an emm14 strain isolated from a patient with NF and screened for mutants of decreased virulence, using a mouse model of human soft-tissue infection. A mutant that survived in the skin but was attenuated in its ability to reach the spleen and to cause a lethal infection was identified. The transposon was inserted into a small open reading frame (ORF) in a locus termed sil, streptococcal invasion locus. sil contains at least five genes (silA-E) and is highly homologous to the quorum-sensing competence regulons of Streptococcus pneumoniae. silA and silB encode a putative two-component system whereas silD and silE encode two putative ABC transporters. silC is a small ORF of unknown function preceded by a combox promoter. Insertion and deletion mutants of sil had a diminished lethality in the animal model. Virulence of a deletion mutant of silC was restored when injected together with the avirulent emm14-deletion mutant, but not when these mutants were injected into opposite flanks of a mouse. DNA transfer between these mutants occurred in vivo but could not account for the complementation of virulence. DNA exchange between the emm14-deletion mutant and mutants of sil occurred also in vitro, at a frequency of approximately 10-8 for a single antibiotic marker. Whereas silC and silD mutants exchanged markers with the emm14 mutant, silB mutant did not. Thus, we identified a novel locus, which controls GAS spreading into deeper tissues and could be involved in DNA transfer.
TI  - Frequent oligonucleotide motifs in genomes of three streptococci.
AB  - Complete genomes of three closely related Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Lactococcus lactis are analyzed for abundances of short DNA sequence motifs (frequent words). The character and extent of frequent words are strikingly different among these genomes. The frequent words of S.pneumoniae split into three categories: parts of the previously characterized RUP and BOX repetitive elements and a 24 bp tandem repeat in the gene SP1772. The most abundant frequent words of L.lactis are all related to the 13 bp motif, WWNTTACTGACRR or its inverted complement YYGTCAGTAANWW. Distributional analysis of this motif, which we called highly repetitive motif (HRM), indicates its possible dual role. Frequent occurrences immediately downstream of genes suggest a possible role in transcription termination whereas spacings of consecutive HRMs consistent with the DNA helical period are indicative of a protein-binding site. Two regions of the L.lactis genome feature an intriguing pattern of several periodically occurring HRMs separated by precisely 59 bp. In a striking contrast to S.pneumoniae and L.lactis, S.pyogenes contains hardly any frequent words.
TI  - Iron acquisition by Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - For the majority of bacterial pathogens, acquisition of iron from host proteins is a prerequisite for growth during infection. The mechanisms by which Gram-negative bacteria obtain iron from host proteins have been well described, but only recently has substantial progress been made in identifying these mechanisms for Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. This review provides an overview of the existing knowledge on the genetic basis of iron transport for important Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Ketolides: the future of the macrolides?
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections is increasing. Ketolides, semi-synthetic derivatives of erythromycin, overcome the macrolide resistance mechanisms found in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, two key pathogens. They also have improved potency and longer post-antibiotic effects, while maintaining the antibacterial spectrum of the macrolide class. The new ketolides cethromycin (ABT-773) and telithromycin have overall antibacterial properties that suggest they will be clinically useful new antibiotics and are undergoing clinical development and regulatory review.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Patterns of isolation of common gram positive bacterial pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents in Jimma Hospital.
AB  - Gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients. The pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between January 1997 and June 2000 in Jimma Hospital. Of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. The following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), CoNS, 36 (31.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) Streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and Streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. The in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin G, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. The majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. The resistance patterns of S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7% and 100% respectively. Penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects (< 60%) on both S. aureus and CoNS. Multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. All isolates of S. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. This entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.
TI  - Molecular characterization of macrolide resistance mechanisms among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from the PROTEKT 1999-2000 study.
AB  - In this study, the distribution of macrolide resistance mechanisms was determined for isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes obtained from the PROTEKT 1999-2000 study (a global, longitudinal study of the antibacterial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections). The global macrolide resistance mechanism distribution results for 1043 macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates collected from 25 countries were as follows: 35.3% mef(A), 56.2% erm(B), 6.8% both mef(A) and erm(B), 0.2% erm(A) subclass erm(TR) and 1.5% negative for mechanisms tested. Mechanisms of macrolide resistance were found to vary widely between countries and different geographical regions with mef(A) predominating in North America and erm(B) in Europe. Approximation of genotype from macrolide MIC without molecular determination of the mechanism of resistance resulted in an error of 10.2% (106 isolates). Overall, for 143 macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes isolates, 46.1% of the isolates tested were mef(A), 30.8% were erm(B), 23.1% were erm(A) subclass erm(TR) and no isolates were negative for all the genetic markers tested. Again, the distribution varied widely between countries and geographical regions. This study provides valuable baseline data for the continued monitoring of the evolution of macrolide resistance development in these important respiratory tract pathogens. The ketolide telithromycin retained excellent anti-pneumococcal activity irrespective of macrolide resistance mechanism, having a MIC(90) of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/L against mef(A), erm(B) and mef(A)+erm(B) macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, respectively. It also exhibited potent activity against S. pyogenes that had become resistant to macrolides via either mef(A), (MIC(90 )0.5 mg/L) or erm(TR), (MIC(90) 0.03 mg/L).
TI  - [Interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  mecA, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. In relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsB, the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been recently described. In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for Staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vanA is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.
TI  - Anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including Gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal G. vaginalis in both genders. From a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. Inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. Several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. At least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. Most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). S. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, Streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and Haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. G. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of Nitens mouthwash (cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate) on  multiple isolates of pharyngeal microbes: a controlled study against chlorhexidine, benzydamine, hexetidine, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clarithromycin, and cefaclor.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute oropharyngeal and respiratory tract infections are due to a wide spectrum of microorganisms. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the in vitro activity of four antiseptics (cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate, chlorhexidine, benzydamine, hexetidine) to four antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clarithromycin, cefaclor) on strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed on 90, aerobic and anaerobic, bacterial strains, isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (by microdilution) and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined and compared. RESULTS: Our selected panel of bacteria was highly susceptible to the antiseptics, particularly to chlorhexidine and naproxenate, even more so than two of the most frequently used antibiotics. Data were statistically significant (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: In view of their bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties, these antiseptics may be effective in controlling the transitory colonization of the oral cavity by microbes that cause or worsen disease in patients with mild infections.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of erythromycin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from blood and noninvasive sites.
AB  - Erythromycin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood cultures and noninvasive sites were studied over a 3-year period. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance was 11.9% (19 of 160) in blood culture isolates but 4.2% (60 of 1,435) in noninvasive-site isolates. Sixty-two of the 79 resistant isolates were available for study. The M phenotype was responsible for 76% (47 of 62) of resistance, largely due to a serotype 14 clone, characterized by multilocus sequence typing as ST9, which accounted for 79% (37 of 47) of M phenotype resistance. The ST9 clone was 4.8 times more common in blood than in noninvasive sites. All M phenotype isolates were PCR positive for mef(A), but sequencing revealed that the ST9 clone possessed the mef(A) sequence commonly associated with Streptococcus pyogenes. All M phenotype isolates with this mef(A) sequence also had sequences consistent with the presence of the Tn1207.1 genetic element inserted in the celB gene. In contrast, isolates with the mef(E) sequence normally associated with S. pneumoniae contained sequences consistent with the presence of the mega insertion element. All MLS(B) isolates carried erm(B), and two isolates carried both erm(B) and mef(E). Fourteen of the 15 MLS(B) isolates were tetracycline resistant and contained tet(M). However, six M phenotype isolates of serotypes 19 (two isolates) and 23 (four isolates) were also tetracycline resistant and contained tet(M). MICs for isolates with the mef(A) sequence were significantly higher than MICs for isolates with the mef(E) sequence (P < 0.001). Thus, the ST9 clone of S. pneumoniae is a significant cause of invasive pneumococcal disease in northeast Scotland and is the single most important contributor to M phenotype erythromycin resistance.
TI  - Complete genome sequence and comparative genomic analysis of an emerging human pathogen, serotype V Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The 2,160,267 bp genome sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae, the leading cause of bacterial sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis in neonates in the U.S. and Europe, is predicted to encode 2,175 genes. Genome comparisons among S. agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and the other completely sequenced genomes identified genes specific to the streptococci and to S. agalactiae. These in silico analyses, combined with comparative genome hybridization experiments between the sequenced serotype V strain 2603 V/R and 19 S. agalactiae strains from several serotypes using whole-genome microarrays, revealed the genetic heterogeneity among S. agalactiae strains, even of the same serotype, and provided insights into the evolution of virulence mechanisms.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. Recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill C. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. We examined C. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. We demonstrate that S. pyogenes kills C. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. Unlike P. aeruginosa and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the killing by S. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. Major exotoxins of S. pyogenes are not involved in the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout mutants. Moreover, no accumulation of S. pyogenes in C. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. Preliminary results show that S. pneumoniae can also kill C. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill C. elegans.
TI  - Antistreptococcal activity of telithromycin compared with seven other drugs in relation to macrolide resistance mechanisms in Russia.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 468 recent Russian clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates and 600 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, from 14 centers in Russia, to telithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, levofloxacin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and penicillin G were tested. Penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae strains were rare except in Siberia, where their prevalence rate was 13.5%: most were penicillin intermediate, but for three strains (two from Smolensk and one from Novosibirsk) the MICs of penicillin G were 4 or 8 micro g/ml. Overall, 2.5% of S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Efflux was the prevalent resistance mechanism (five strains; 41.7%), followed by ribosomal methylation encoded by constitutive erm(B), which was found in four isolates. Ribosomal mutation was the mechanism of macrolide resistance in three isolates; one erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolate had an A2059G mutation in 23S rRNA, and two isolates had substitution of GTG by TPS at positions 69 to 71 in ribosomal protein L4. All S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and 11% were erythromycin resistant. Ribosomal methylation was the most common resistance mechanism for S. pyogenes (89.4%). These methylases were encoded by erm(A) [subclass erm(TR)] genes, and their expression was inducible in 96.6% of isolates. The rest of the erythromycin-resistant Russian S. pyogenes isolates (7.6%) had an efflux resistance mechanism. Telithromycin was active against 100% of pneumococci and 99.2% of S. pyogenes, and levofloxacin and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all isolates of both species.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial-resistance of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes in healthy children in the region of Madrid.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are common agents of respiratory or ORL pathology. Pneumococcus sensitivity has progressively decreased to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents, mainly in south of Europe, but this resistance report can be erroneous by a selection bias, because they sampled only hospital cases. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility and risk factors of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes in healthy children under 5 years of age who go to infant school. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Cross sectional study in six infant schools. An epidemiological inquiry (risk factors of carrier state) was filled out and a nasopharyngeal specimen was taken from each child, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were identified and antimicrobial tests were performed. RESULTS: We have studied 156 children with a mean age of 2.24 (standard deviation (S.D.), 0.85) and 58% have been treated with antibiotic in the last 3 months. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae or S. pyogenes were 12.2 and 5.1%, respectively. S. pyogenes only was isolated in two schools. Age was associated with S. pyogenes carrier but the rest of studied factors have no statistical significance with both microorganisms. All the S. pneumoniae showed resistance to one or more antibiotic (mainly to clavunate-amoxycillin: 94.7%), while S. pyogenes only was resistant to clavunate-amoxycillin. CONCLUSION: Healthy children (0-4 years) with antibiotherapy in last 3 months have a great frequency of resistant S. pneumoniae. It is necessary to reduce the antibiotic use at home (Medical education).
TI  - Legionnaires disease with bacteremic coinfection.
AB  - We describe 6 patients who had bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia and unsuspected Legionella pneumophila coinfection. We reviewed case records of patients who were diagnosed as having a recent Legionella infection on the basis of either the presence of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine or a 4-fold increase in L. pneumophila antibody level and with a blood culture that yielded a bacterium other than L. pneumophila. Three patients were diagnosed with legionellosis on the basis of the presence of antigen in urine, and 3 were diagnosed on the basis of a 4-fold increase in antibody titer. Of these 6 patients, 4 were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 with Streptococcus pyogenes, and 1 with Enterobacter cloacae. L. pneumophila infection in these patients may have predisposed them to concomitant bacteremia. Initial empiric antimicrobial therapy for patients who live in areas of endemicity and who are smokers should be treated with antimicrobial agents that have activity against pneumococcus and Legionella species.
TI  - Antibody to streptococcal cysteine proteinase as a seromarker of group A Streptococcal (Streptococcus pyogenes) infections.
AB  - Serological tests are commonly employed to aid the diagnosis of Streptococcus pyogenes infections, particularly when non-suppurative sequelae are suspected. Conventional laboratory practice is to measure antibody levels to various combinations of the extracellular group A Streptococcus (GAS) antigens streptolysin O (SLO), DNase B, streptokinase and hyaluronidase. Antibody to the extracellular cysteine proteinase streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B) and its precursor zymogen is also produced in response to GAS infections. An indirect hemagglutination test for antibody to zymogen/SPE B was established and evaluated in serum samples from 168 patients with proven (n = 27) or suspected GAS (n = 141) infections, which were also screened for antibodies using the 4 conventional tests. For comparison, sera from 56 patients infected with a variety of other pathogens, as well as sera from 16 patients infected with either S. agalactiae or S. pneumoniae and 34 sera from healthy subjects, were tested. Statistical analysis confirmed that antibody to zymogen/SPE B is a serological marker that can discriminate GAS infections. It can be ranked with the anti-SLO titer, currently the most widely used test, as a marker of an antecedent GAS infection.
TI  - Evolving resistance patterns in community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens: first results from the PROTEKT global surveillance study. Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin.
AB  - In recent years, antibacterial resistance among respiratory pathogens implicated  in community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has spread worldwide at an alarming rate. Thus, there is a pressing need for new antibacterials that retain activity against resistant organisms, have a low potential to select for resistance and do not induce cross-resistance. Telithromycin is the first of a new class of antibacterials - the ketolides - that have been designed specifically to overcome resistance among respiratory tract pathogens. This paper presents the first results of the PROTEKT study (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin), a worldwide surveillance study initiated to chart the prevalence of important resistance phenotypes and genotypes and the comparative activity of telithromycin against such strains. Analysis of over 7,000 bacterial isolates by April 2001 has confirmed the notable prevalence of strains resistant to commonly prescribed RTI antibacterials for all the pathogens studied. Telithromycin demonstrates high activity against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, irrespective of penicillin G, macrolide or fluoroquinolone resistance. Telithromycin is also highly active against other respiratory tract pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes and beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. These data justify the assertion that telithromycin is a promising new candidate for the empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs, particularly in the face of increasing antibacterial resistance.
TI  - The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in PmpA, the PrsA-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The prsA-like gene from Lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to PrsA, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in Bacillus subtilis, was characterized. This gene, annotated pmpA, encodes a lipoprotein of 309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. A slight increase in the expression of the PrsA-like protein (PLP) in L. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the Staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. This shows that PmpA either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease HtrA. Unlike the case for B. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding PmpA reduced only slightly the growth rate of L. lactis in standard conditions. However, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. Like PrsA of B. subtilis and PrtM of L. lactis, the L. lactis PmpA protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. These proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (PPIases) for which parvulin is the prototype. Almost all PLP from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the PPIase signature. An exception to this situation was found only in Streptococcaceae, the family to which L. lactis belongs. PLP from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of L. lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus mutans do not. However, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of PLP is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. The activity associated with the expression of PmpA in L. lactis and these genomic data show that either the PPIase motif is not necessary for PPIase activity or, more likely, PmpA foldase activity does not necessarily require PPIase activity.
TI  - [Lung abscess due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in an adolescent].
AB  - Pulmonary abscess is an uncommon complication of pneumonia in children. Pyogenes, in particular Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae are the principal responsible bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is rarely the cause. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old child was hospitalized with right thoracic pain. The patient was non-febrile and had a recent history of moderate infection. He was receiving antibiotic (macrolide) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. CT scan confirmed a mid-lobe abscess in the right lung. Interruption of therapy resulted in fever and increase in C-reactive level with hyperleucocytosis, suggesting that the abscess was caused by a bacterial infection. The child's general condition and the radiographic picture improved with combined antibiotic therapy with amoxycillin and clavulanic acid, aminoglycosides and macrolides. The suspected diagnostic of M. pneumoniae was confirmed by increased IgM antibodies for M. pneumoniae. Recovery was complete two months later without sequelae. COMMENT: Pulmonary abscess is a rare complication of M. pneumoniae infection in children. This complication should be considered when the general condition does not improve despite appropriate early treatment of a pneumonia, as in the case of our patient.
TI  - In vitro activities of the ketolides ABT-773 and telithromycin and of three macrolides against genetically characterized isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.
AB  
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2000).
AB  - Susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahS) and viridans group (VgS) streptococci in the four regions of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program: Asia-Pacific (APAC), Europe (EU), Latin America (LA) and North America (NA). In 1997 through 2000, SENTRY Program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria. Among the betahS processed, 81.9% of strains were either Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or S. agalactiae (n = 1,190). The VgS were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or S. mitis (n = 254; 22%). Seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (ER), clindamycin (CM), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), vancomycin (VA), teicoplanin (TP) and linezolid (LZ) were tested. Rank order of susceptibility for betahS isolates was: ceftriaxone (CTX) = Q/D = VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (GATI) = trovafloxacin (TROV, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (LEVO; 99.7%) > penicillin (PEN; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (GREPA; 97.4%) > CM (94.4%) > ER (85.5%). ER versus betahS had the highest MIC(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in NA to 97.3% in LA). Among the VgS, susceptibility rank order was: VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > Q/D (99.1%) > GATI = LEVO = TROVA (98.0%) > GREPA (96.5%) > CTX (92.8%) > CM (90.3%) > PEN (68.6%) > ER (64.5%). Macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the M-phenotype was highest in the Americas, with erm-patterns predominating in EU and APAC regions. BMS284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. Like Streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefpodoxime in respiratory tract infection.
AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis are respiratory tract infections frequently encountered by primary-care physicians. Increasing bacterial resistance, particularly in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is one of the most important respiratory tract bacteria implicated in community-acquired respiratory tract infections, has led to concern about the current options for empirical antibiotic treatment and has prompted a search for effective alternative treatments. Data from in vitro studies show that cefpodoxime has good activity against the main respiratory tract pathogens, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Clinical studies confirm the efficacy of cefpodoxime in AOM, sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis. As with all broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is the risk of promotion of bacterial resistance associated with overuse. However, if used with care, cefpodoxime can be considered as an alternative for empirical treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections encountered in general practice, particularly where penicillins and macrolides have reduced efficacy against the main bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral beta-lactam antibiotics as a two-dimensional approach to their efficacy.
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are increasingly recognized as important determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of an antibiotic. For beta-lactam antibiotics, the most important determinant of the antimicrobial efficacy, and hence predictor of therapeutic efficacy, is the length of time that serum concentrations exceed the MIC. Dosing schedules for beta-lactam antibiotics should maintain serum concentrations above the MIC for the bacterial pathogen for at least 50% of the dosing interval to achieve therapeutic efficacy and prevent the development of resistance. This is a basic criterion for the clinical efficacy of beta-lactams. A combination of microbiological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics was applied to calculate the time that serum antibiotic concentrations exceed the MIC for the major respiratory tract pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In contrast with some other oral beta-lactam antibiotics, cefpodoxime 200 mg bd maintains serum concentrations above the MIC for each organism for at least 50% of the dosing interval and may therefore be an attractive choice for empirical therapy of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against community-acquired respiratory pathogens from three European countries.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is universally recognized as a major problem. A European resistance survey was established to monitor the activity of widely used oral antibiotics against common respiratory tract pathogens. Studies were conducted in Italy, Spain and Austria to monitor resistance patterns among respiratory Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, penicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, clarithromycin and azithromycin (the antibiotics tested varying slightly from country to country). Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the NCCLS-recommended broth microdilution method. Among the antibiotics tested, cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin, was remarkably active against the major respiratory pathogens in all three countries. Cefpodoxime was more potent than cefaclor, cefixime and ceftibuten against pneumococci, especially against strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. Pneumococci and staphylococci displayed a very high level of in vitro macrolide resistance. These data indicate that cefpodoxime represents an appropriate choice in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the three countries surveyed.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Expression of fibronectin-binding protein FbpA modulates adhesion in Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - Fibronectin binding is considered to be an important virulence factor in streptococcal infections. Adhesion of the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii to immobilized forms of fibronectin is mediated, in part, by a high molecular mass wall-anchored protein designated CshA. In this study, a second fibronectin-binding protein of S. gordonii is described that has been designated as FbpA (62.7 kDa). This protein, which is encoded by a gene located immediately downstream of the cshA gene, shows 85 and 81% identity to the fibronectin-binding proteins PavA, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and FBP54, of Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. Purified recombinant FbpA bound to immobilized human fibronectin in a dose-dependant manner, and isogenic mutants in which the fbpA gene was inactivated were impaired in their binding to fibronectin. This effect was apparent only for cells in the exponential phase of growth, and was associated with reduced surface hydrophobicity and the surface expression of CshA. Cells in the stationary phase of growth were unaffected in their ability to bind to fibronectin. By utilizing gene promoter fusions with cat (encoding chloramphenicol O-acetyltransferase), it was demonstrated that cshA expression was down-regulated during the exponential phase of growth in the fbpA mutant. Expression of fbpA, but not cshA, was sensitive to atmospheric O2 levels, and was found to be up-regulated in the presence of elevated O2 levels. The results suggest that FbpA plays a regulatory role in the modulation of CshA expression and, thus, affects the adhesion of S. gordonii to fibronectin.
TI  - Cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir. METHODS: Studies were identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-September 2001) of the English-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed. RESULTS: Cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of the common beta-lactamases. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin V, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil. CONCLUSIONS: Cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Comparison of selection for mutants with reduced susceptibility to ABT-773, erythromycin and rifampicin in respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Attempts were made to select mutants on agar media containing the new ketolide ABT-773, erythromycin or rifampicin, at concentrations above the MICs, from Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, including erythromycin-resistant strains. ABT-773 did not select for mutants in four strains, whereas in eight strains the frequencies at 72 h were < or = 10(-9). ABT-773 MICs were 0.015-4 mg/L for mutants, except those selected from inducible Erm(A) S. aureus. Mutants selected on ABT-773 or erythromycin were cross-resistant to ABT-773, erythromycin and, sometimes, clindamycin. The susceptibility profiles indicate that different mutations were selected and that ABT-773 and erythromycin may interact with the ribosome differently.
TI  - Increased prevalence of erythromycin resistance in streptococci: substantial upsurge in erythromycin-resistant M phenotype in Streptococcus pyogenes (1979-1998) but not in Streptococcus pneumoniae (1985-1999) in Taiwan.
AB  - A total of 394 nonduplicate isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes collected from 1979 to 1998 and 267 nonduplicate isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae collected from October, 1998, to May, 1999, in Taiwan were evaluated. Among the 220 erythromycin-resistant (MIC, > or =1 microg/ml) S. pyogenes isolates, 35% had an M phenotype and 65% had an ML phenotype (inducible resistance [iML], 0.5%, and constitutive resistance [cML], 64.5%). Among the 243 erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates, the majority (65.4%) had an ML phenotype (iML, 0.4%, and cML, 65%) and 34.6% had an M phenotype. A substantial upsurge in the incidence of M-phenotype erythromycin-resistant isolates was found with time for S. pyogenes (0% in 1979-1984 and 100% in 1997-1998), and an increasing incidence of M-phenotype among erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae was also noted (<20% before 1994 and 45.4% in 1999). All S. pyogenes and all but four S. pneumoniae isolates exhibiting a cML or iML phenotype had harbored the ermAM gene. The presence of the mefA gene was demonstrated in all isolates of S. pyogenes and the mefE gene in all but four S. pneumoniae isolates exhibiting the M phenotype. Due to the increasing susceptibility of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae isolates to clindamycin, susceptibility tests of these two organisms to macrolides and clindamycin should be performed simultaneously in the clinical microbiology laboratory, particularly in areas with high rates of macrolide resistance.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Viridans group streptococci: a reservoir of resistant bacteria in oral cavities.
AB  - The worldwide spread of erythromycin A-resistant streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, is of concern. Many studies have demonstrated that the viridans group streptococci can be a reservoir of erythromycin A resistance. Within oral streptoccoci, an important difference in the susceptibility pattern has been noted. The purpose of this short editorial is to highlight the importance of this group of bacteria as a reservoir of resistance to erythromycin A and the possible transfer of resistance to S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes: results of a multicentre study in Turkey.
AB  - The in vitro activities of several antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (283), Haemophilus influenzae (272), Moraxella catarrhalis (179) and Streptococcus pyogenes (256) were determined in a multicentre study with the participation of five hospitals from four cities in Turkey. Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae was evaluated using the E-test and the remaining agents by disk diffusion. For S. pneumoniae overall 25.8% of the isolates were intermediately and 3.9% were highly resistant to penicillin and resistance to chloramphenicol, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) was 3.8, 2.1 and 55.4%, respectively. Seven percent of H. influenzae produced beta-lactamase and all were susceptible to cefotaxime and azithromycin; the highest rate of resistance, 23.5%, was for TMP/SMX. Eighty-one percent of M. catarrhalis isolates produced beta-lactamase, 18.4% were resistant to TMP/SMX and all were susceptible to sulbactam/ampicillin combination. Resistance to chloramphenicol and azithromycin of S. pyogenes was 2.2 and 1.9%, respectively.
TI  - In vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  - Fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. The trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. Carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both Gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. We determined the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. All Gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/L of carboxyfullerene, whereas Gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/L carboxyfullerene. Bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for Gram-positive species, particularly for Streptococcus pyogenes A-20, which was killed rapidly. Intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by TEM and anti-carboxyfullerene binding assay. Damage to the cell membrane in Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. These findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  - Genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. Among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (CPs) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. In the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. The capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the CP of Streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. A more complex situation has been found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. On the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. Streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. This concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae,  Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis from community acquired respiratory infections in 2000].
AB  - The Viriato Study is a nationwide, multicenter prospective study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Portugal. In 2000, 28 laboratories participated in the study with a total of 1071 strains, with testing undertaken in a central laboratory. Of the 213 Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from patients with acute tonsillitis, all were susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefuroxime, but 21.1% were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and 16.4% to tetracycline. From patients with lower respiratory tract infection, 403 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 366 of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 89 of Moraxella catarrhalis were studied. 13.1% of H. influenzae and 94.4% of M. catarrhalis produced beta-lactamase. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 25.1% were resistant to penicillin (8.8% showing high-level resistance), 14.5% to tetracycline, 12.8% to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin, and 10.1% to cefuroxime. Overall, penicillin was the most active antimicrobial against S. pyogenes and amoxycillin/clavulanate the most active in vitro simultaneously against H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis isolated from patients with community-acquired LRTI in Portugal.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new ketolide ABT-773 against community acquired respiratory tract isolates and Viridans Streptococci.
AB  - A total of 230 isolates were collected from clinical specimens of patients attending five health centers of the Buenos Aires, Argentina. ABT-773 was compared to erythromycin, azithromycin and clindamycin against bacterial isolates responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections and viridans streptococci showing different resistance patterns. Time-kill curves were also performed against selected resistant isolates. All but one of the 105 pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to ABT-773. Among the erythromycin resistant S. pyogenes isolates, all the M type and inducible isolates were susceptible to ABT-773. ABT-773 showed excellent activity against macrolide, azalide, lincosamide (MAL) inducible S. aureus producers but was inactive against constitutive producers. ABT-773 activity against viridans streptococci was also excellent.ABT-773 exerted bactericidal activity against selected isolates of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, however, it was only bacteriostatic against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - The effect of carbon dioxide on susceptibility testing of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes by broth microdilution and the Etest: Artemis Project-first-phase study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of carbon dioxide on the susceptibility testing, using broth microdilution and the Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. METHODS: Fresh clinical isolates collected from 36 hospital laboratories in 12 countries were evaluated using the Etest in the presence of carbon dioxide. The isolates were retested under ambient conditions (absence of carbon dioxide) using broth microdilution and/or the Etest. RESULTS: Carbon dioxide falsely elevated azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin MIC90S for S. pneumoniae, determined by the Etest, approximately 12-fold. Also, the azithromycin MIC90 for S. pyogenes was increased fourfold; the effect was less marked for clarithromycin and roxithromycin. When isolates were retested in the absence of carbon dioxide, using the Etest or microdilution, susceptibilities to azithromycin were comparable to those to clarithromycin (S. pneumoniae, 93.4% versus 91.3%; S. pyogenes, 96.4% versus 95.8%). Both organisms were less susceptible to roxithromycin (S. pneumoniae, 71.3%; S. pyogenes, 85.7%). An internal standard control, consisting of 50 isolates each of S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, confirmed that azithromycin susceptibility testing resulted in falsely elevated MICs. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon dioxide falsely elevated azithromycin MICs for S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, with an apparent reduction in susceptibility. When the in vitro activity of azithromycin and other macrolides against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes is being evaluated, awareness of the pH effect is essential.

AB  
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of ABT-773 and telithromycin against macrolide-susceptible and -resistant streptococci and staphylococci.
AB  - The activity of a new ketolide, ABT-773, was compared to the activity of the ketolide telithromycin (HMR-3647) against over 600 gram-positive clinical isolates, including 356 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 167 Staphylococcus aureus, and 136 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates. Macrolide-susceptible isolates as well as macrolide-resistant isolates with ribosomal methylase (Erm), macrolide efflux (Mef), and ribosomal mutations were tested using the NCCLS reference broth microdilution method. Both compounds were extremely active against macrolide-susceptible isolates, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC90s) for susceptible streptococci and staphylococci ranging from 0.002 to 0.03 microg/ml for ABT-773 and 0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml for telithromycin. ABT-773 had increased activities against macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (Erm MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml; Mef MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml) compared to those of telithromycin (Erm MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml; Mef MIC90, 1 microg/ml). Both compounds were active against strains with rRNA or ribosomal protein mutations (MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml). ABT-773 was also more active against macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes (ABT-773 Erm MIC90, 0.5 microg/ml; ABT-773 Mef MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml; telithromycin Erm MIC90, >8 microg/ml; telithromycin Mef MIC90, 1.0 microg/ml). Both compounds lacked activity against constitutive macrolide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but had good activities against inducibly resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ABT-773 MIC90, 0.06 microg/ml; telithromycin MIC90, 0.5 microg/ml). ABT-773 has superior activity against macrolide-resistant streptococci compared to that of telithromycin.
TI  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations and time-kill determination of moxifloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic isolates.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a new oral 8-methoxy-quinolone with a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, atypical micro-organisms and multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. This study was designed to assess the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria with different resistance patterns, anaerobes and atypical micro-organisms such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma. Moxifloxacin had good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae with all strains inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of moxifloxacin for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae ranged from 0.03 to 0.5 mg/l while those of ciprofloxacin were about two- to four-fold higher (MICs=0.12-1 mg/l). Moxifloxacin was poorly active against enterococci but its activity against Clostridium and Bacteroides spp. was in the same range as that of metronidazole and superior to that of clindamycin. Moxifloxacin was substantially more active than both ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Chlamydia.
TI  - [Current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ENT-infections].
AB  - In bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis Streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. S. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. To decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ENT-infections is necessary. The new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. Efficacy of short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. In more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. Both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. In more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime are widely used and effective. Ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while Ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). A dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ENT-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.
TI  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial respiratory pathogens from Norway is low.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the degree of bacterial susceptibility to the most commonly used drugs for respiratory infections in Norway, and to find if bacterial resistance is emerging. METHODS: Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci from respiratory tract specimens and from the eye were collected from different parts of Norway during two study periods. During the first period (1993-1994), three laboratories, covering 15% of the Norwegian population, participated. During the second study period in 1997, five laboratories, covering 27% of the population, collected respiratory isolates. In total, 494 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 696 isolates of H. influenzae and 694 isolates of group A streptococci were included in the study. The study population comprised children and adults attending hospital and general practice. Bacterial susceptibility was determined by the E test, and breakpoints were according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial resistance was low, and we observed no significant increase in bacterial resistance between the two study periods. In 1997, only 0.6% of pneumococci had decreased susceptibility to penicillin, 1.6% of group A streptococci were resistant to erythromycin, and 6.7% of all isolates of H. influenzae produced beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens in Norway is low.
TI  - Upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Acute respiratory infections accounts for 20-40% of outpatient and 12-35% of inpatient attendance in a general hospital. Upper respiratory tract infections including nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and otitis media constitute 87.5% of the total episodes of respiratory infections. The vast majority of acute upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses. Common cold is caused by viruses in most circumstances and does not require antimicrobial agent unless it is complicated by acute otitis media with effusion, tonsillitis, sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infection. Sinusitis is commonly associated with common cold. Most instances of rhinosinusitis are viral and therefore, resolve spontaneously without antimicrobial therapy. The most common bacterial agents causing sinusitis are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus and S. pyogenes. Amoxycillin is antibacterial of choice. The alternative drugs are cefaclor or cephalexin. The latter becomes first line if sinusitis is recurrent or chronic. Acute pharyngitis is commonly caused by viruses and does not need antibiotics. About 15% of the episodes may be due to Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABS). Early initiation of antibiotics in pharyngitis due to GABS can prevent complications such as acute rheumatic fever. The drug of choice is penicillin for 10-14 days. The alternative medications include oral cephalosporins (cefaclor, cephalexin), amoxicillin or macrolides.
TI  - Cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. Cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the Gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the important Gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. In healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/L and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/L, respectively. Cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. In two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. Clinical cure rates in patients with AECB were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. In patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. In uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. These cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
TI  - Susceptibility to moxifloxacin and other antimicrobial agents of major pathogens  responsible for community acquired respiratory tract infection in Poland.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of other antimicrobial agents against 470 bacterial strains isolated from patients with respiratory tract infection. Bacteria studied included 110 penicillin susceptible and 110 penicillin non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, 50 strains of S. pyogenes, 120 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 80 strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin was the most active of the antimicrobials tested.
TI  - Review of cefditoren, an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefditoren is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic approved for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin/skin structure infections in adult and adolescent patients. OBJECTIVE: This article briefly reviews the chemistry, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of cefditoren. METHODS: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1985 to October 2001) of the medical literature, review of the English-language literature, reference lists within these articles, as well as data presented at the 40th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. RESULTS: Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobes, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. Cefditoren is rapidly absorbed (time to peak plasma concentration, approximately 2-3 hours) from the gastrointestinal tract and is almost completely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of the compound is approximately 0.8 to 1.3 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Cefditoren is effective in the management of AECB (in regimens of 400 mg twice daily for 10 days) and acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngotonsillitis due to S pyogenes, and uncomplicated skin/skin structure infections (in regimens of 200 mg twice daily for 10 days). Cefditoren possesses broad activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of numerous beta-lactamases. Its pharmacokinetic properties, in conjunction with in vitro susceptibility data, document the feasibility of twice-daily dosing.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on respiratory tract pathogens, using a modified dilution assay method.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the antibacterial effects of a wide variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major components was evaluated by agar-plate dilution assay under sealed conditions, with agar used as a stabilizer for homogeneous dispersion. Of the selected strains of four major bacteria causing respiratory tract infection, Haemophilus influenzae was most susceptible to the essential oils, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus was less susceptible. No cross-resistance was observed between penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Escherichia coli, used as a control bacterium, showed the lowest susceptibility. Essential oils containing aldehyde or phenol as a major component showed the highest antibacterial activity, followed by the essential oils containing terpene alcohols. Other essential oils, containing terpene ketone, or ether, had much weaker activity, and an oil containing terpene hydrocarbon was inactive. Based on these findings, thyme (wild, red, and geraniol types), cinnamon bark, lemongrass, perilla, and peppermint oils were selected for further evaluation of their effects on respiratory tract infection.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against respiratory pathogens isolated from children in Japan.
AB  - There is an increasing spread and incidence of penicillin-resistant bacteria that are becoming less susceptible to commonly prescribed oral antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Against this background, we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and the in-vitro activity of oral antimitrobials. Between April 1996 and December 1997, in 245 children with respiratory tract infections (bronchitis in 61, pharyngitis in 115, and tonsillitis in 69), 119 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 89 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 61 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 36 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 34 strains of Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from the pharynx. The antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed by a broth microdilution method. The isolation incidence of penicillin-intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-highly resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was 59.0% and 13.1%, respectively. Most strains of PISP and PRSP were highly resistant to cefaclor, cefpodoxime, cefteram, cefdinir, clarithromycin, ampicillin, and minocycline, but susceptibile to ofloxacin and cefditoren (CDTR). The in-vitro activity of CDTR was superior to that of other cephalosporins, such as cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime, when tested against both the beta-lactamase-positive and -negative H. influenzae isolated. CDTR was also active against all the other strains, including methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and M. catarrhalis. This study suggested that CDTR was a useful oral antibiotic for pediatric respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus C-terminal motif, Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG). This sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. Using the type strain of Streptococcus suis, NCTC 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. One gene, designated srtA, was linked to gyrA, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. Three genes, designated srtB, srtC, and srtD, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. The remaining gene, designated srtE, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five Srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus, except that SrtA of S. suis had 65% identity with that of S. gordonii. Isogenic mutants deficient for srtA, srtBCD, or srtE were generated by allelic exchanges. The protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with N-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srtA mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srtA cloned from S. suis. Four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. The deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the LPXTG motif in their C-terminal regions. On the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srtA mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtBCD and srtE mutants. These results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srtA is also present in S. suis.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated in 1998 and 1999 from patients with infections of upper airways residing in Western Pomerania.
AB  - Sensitivity to antibiotics of the most common pathogens isolated from the upper airways in north-west part of Poland shown significant regional variation. The rise in resistance to penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae (to 22%) and to macrolides for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus was observed. No differences in sensitivity have been found between pathogens isolated from hospital and ambulatory patients.
TI  - A XerD recombinase with unusual active site motifs in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - XerD belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. Sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of E. coli XerD and related enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids R-H-R-H that are spaced along the C-terminal domain in addition to a conserved K and the active site Y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative S. pneumoniae XerD contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in L-Q-R-L; moreover, the active site Y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme C-terminal region suggested to be involved in interaction of E. coli XerD with XerC was lacking. Severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerD mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the S. pneumoniae XerD protein. Highly related xerD genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in S. mitis, S. mutans and S. pyogenes but not in other Gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. There are at least another four genes in the S. pneumoniae KNR_7/87 genome encoding Xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerC homologue. The xerD and xerC genes were present in a sample of 20 S. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.
TI  - Comparative pharmacodynamics of azithromycin and roxithromycin with S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae in a model that simulates in vitro pharmacokinetics in human tonsils.
AB  - Most macrolides penetrate and persist in peripheral tissues, irrespective of plasma concentrations. For this reason, comparative pharmacodynamics of macrolides might be better based on tissue rather than plasma pharmacokinetics. The present study compares the antimicrobial effects of azithromycin and roxithromycin on Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae using in vitro simulations of steady-state pharmacokinetics in human tonsils expected after a third 500 mg dose of azithromycin administered once a day and after a sixth 150 mg dose of roxithromycin administered twice a day. Clinical isolates of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae (MICs 0.12 and 0.47 mg/L of azithromycin, and 0.15 and 0.60 mg/L of roxithromycin, respectively) were used. More pronounced antistreptococcal effects were observed with azithromycin than with roxithromycin. Despite similar rates of initial killing of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, the respective 12 h areas between the control growth curve and the time-kill curve of antibiotic-exposed bacteria (ABBCs) were 22% and 36% greater with azithromycin than roxithromycin. Moreover, with azithromycin, viable bacterial counts reached the theoretically achievable limit of detection (10 cfu/mL) 8-10 h after drug administration, with no regrowth within 48 h. In contrast to azithromycin, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae exposed to roxithromycin regrew 26 and 6 h, respectively, after initial reduction of the starting inoculum. Further in vitro simulations of tissue pharmacokinetics might be useful for pharmacodynamic comparisons among other macrolides.
TI  - Epidemiological aspects of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Respiratory infections are the most frequent reason for primary health care consultation. The main causes of respiratory tract infections in children are viruses and the most common types are upper respiratory tract infections: common cold, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Pneumonia is much more serious. As well as viruses, bacteria are often involved in respiratory tract infections. Three bacterial species are most commonly isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria isolated from community-acquired infection usually are sensitive to the majority of suitable drugs, but during the past two decades, significant antibiotic resistance has emerged. Resistance to penicillins has spread among H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The mechanism of penicillin resistance in H. influenzae is mainly by production of beta-lactamases TEM-1 and ROB-1, whereas in S. pneumoniae resistance is an effect of the changes in penicillin binding proteins. Among respiratory pathogens, resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has also appeared. Several mechanisms depending on changes in target, active efflux and modifying enzymes are involved.
TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis media recently treated with aminopenicillins.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sparse recent data are available in the United States regarding the pathogens of acute otitis media (AOM) most likely to be recovered from children recently treated with the two most frequently prescribed antibiotics, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC). METHODS: Of the 704 rural Kentucky children with culture-positive AOM who underwent a single tympanocentesis or culture of otorrhea between 1992 and 1998, 96 pathogens were recovered from 90 children during therapy or within 7 days posttherapy with an aminopenicillin. Identification and susceptibility testing of AOM pathogens were performed by routine National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods. RESULTS: Pathogens recovered from children with AOM recently treated (0 to 7 days) with amoxicillin (n = 38) and AMC (n = 58), respectively, were as follows: Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase-negative), 16 and 29%; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase-positive), 11 and 22%; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 and 12%; intermediately penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP), 20 and 10%; resistant PNSP 13 and 17%; Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase-positive), 13 and 7%; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 and 2%. H. influenzae was also isolated from 8 (75%) of 12 children treated with high dose AMC ( approximately 80 mg/kg/day amoxicillin component). Significantly fewer children recently treated with amoxicillin were otitis-prone than those given AMC (24% vs. 74%, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The predominant pathogen recovered from children with AOM recently treated with amoxicillin was S. pneumoniae (59%) rather than beta-lactamase-producing organisms (24%). H. influenzae was the predominant (51%) pathogen, rather than PNSP (27%), recovered from children recently treated with AMC.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of 1,684 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2,039 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates and their ecological relationships: results of a 1-year (1998-1999) multicenter surveillance study in Spain.
AB  - A nationwide multicenter susceptibility surveillance study which included 1,684 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2,039 S. pyogenes isolates was carried out over 1 year in order to assess the current resistance patterns for the two most important gram-positive microorganisms responsible for community-acquired infections in Spain. Susceptibility testing was done by a broth microdilution method according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M100-S10 interpretative criteria. For S. pneumoniae, the prevalences of highly resistant strains were 5% for amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; 7% for cefotaxime; 22% for penicillin; 31% for cefuroxime; 35% for erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin; and 42% for cefaclor. For S. pyogenes, the prevalence of erythromycin resistance was 20%. Efflux was encountered in 90% of S. pyogenes and 5% of S. pneumoniae isolates that exhibited erythromycin resistance. Erythromycin resistance was associated with clarithromycin and azithromycin in both species, regardless of phenotype. Despite the different nature of the mechanisms of resistance, a positive correlation (r = 0.612) between the two species in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance was found in site-by-site comparisons, suggesting some kind of link with antibiotic consumption. Regarding ciprofloxacin, the MIC was >or=4 microg/ml for 7% of S. pneumoniae and 3.5% of S. pyogenes isolates. Ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC, >or=4 microg/ml) was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with macrolide resistance in both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae and with penicillin nonsusceptibility in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Novel erythromycin derivatives with aryl groups tethered to the C-6 position are  potent protein synthesis inhibitors and active against multidrug-resistant respiratory pathogens.
AB  - A novel series of erythromycin derivatives has been discovered with potent activity against key respiratory pathogens, including those resistant to erythromycin. These compounds are characterized by having an aryl group tethered to the C-6 position of the erythronolide skeleton. Extensive structural modification of the C-6 moiety led to the discovery of several promising compounds with potent activity against both mef- and erm-mediated resistant Streptoccoccus pneumoniae. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the new macrolides are potent protein synthesis inhibitors, which interact with methylated ribosomes isolated from resistant organisms. In experimental animal models, these compounds exhibited excellent in vivo efficacy and balanced pharmacokinetic profiles.
TI  - A secondary RNA polymerase sigma factor from Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (the group A streptococcus or GAS) causes diseases ranging from mild, self-limiting pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. Regulation of the expression of GAS genes in response to specific environmental differences within the host is probably key in determining the course of the infectious process, however, little is known of global regulators of gene expression in GAS. Although secondary RNA polymerase sigma factors act as global regulators of gene expression in many other bacteria, none has yet been isolated from the GAS. The newly available GAS genome sequence indicates that the only candidate secondary sigma factor is encoded by two identical open reading frames (ORFS). These ORFS encode a protein that is 40% identical to the transcription factor ComX, believed to act as an RNA polymerase sigma factor in Streptococcus pneumoniae. To test whether the GAS ComX homologue functions as a sigma factor, we cloned and purified it from Escherichia coli. We found that in vitro, this GAS protein, which we call sigmaX, directed core RNA polymerase from Bacillus subtilis to transcribe from two GAS promoters that contain the cin-box region, required for transcription by S. pneumoniae ComX in vivo. On the other hand, GAS sigmaX did not promote transcription of a GAS promoter (hasA) expected to be dependent on sigmaA, the housekeeping or primary RNA polymerase sigma factor. Addition of monoclonal antibody that inhibited sigmaA-directed transcription had no effect on sigmaX-directed transcription, showing that the latter was not the result of contaminating sigmaA. Transcription of both cin-box-containing promoters initiated downstream of the cin-box and two different single basepair substitutions in the cin-box of the cinA promoter each caused a severe reduction of sigmaX-directed transcription in vitro. Thus, the cin-box is required for sigmaX-directed transcription.
TI  - Multicentre study of the in vitro evaluation of moxifloxacin and other quinolones against community acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and trovafloxacin against 710 strains (180 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 180 Haemophilus influenzae, 160 Moraxella catarrhalis and 190 Streptococcus pyogenes) isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections. MIC values for moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin were 0.25/0.25, 0.03/0.03, 0.06/0.03 and 0.125/0.0125 mg/l for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catharralis and S. pyogenes. Based upon the MIC(90) values and the MIC distributions, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were the most active of the quinolones tested. They showed enhanced activity against Gram-positive organisms including penicillin non susceptible S. pneumoniae strains. Moxifloxacin was also highly active against ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains.
TI  - Telithromycin: an oral ketolide for respiratory infections.
AB  - The ketolides represent a new subclass of antibiotics among the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin group. Telithromycin, the first ketolide to be awarded approvable status for clinical use, demonstrates in vitro activity against community-acquired respiratory pathogens including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. An extended half-life permits once-daily oral administration. Telithromycin is a substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and also inhibits drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. A relatively high frequency of mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal adverse effects has been reported. Similar clinical and microbiologic efficacy has been demonstrated with oral dosing in comparative clinical trials for community-acquired pneumonia, acute sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and pharyngitis. Although limited data on penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes are available from clinical trials, this drug appears promising for respiratory infections caused by these pathogens.
TI  - Activities of a new fluoroketolide, HMR 3787, and its (des)-fluor derivative RU 64399 compared to those of telithromycin, erythromycin A, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and clindamycin against macrolide-susceptible or -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes.
AB  - Activities of HMR 3787 and RU 64399 were compared to those of three macrolides, telithromycin, and clindamycin against 175 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates and 121 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates. HMR3787 and telithromycin were the most active compounds tested against pneumococci. Telithromycin and RU 64399 were equally active against macrolide-susceptible (MICs, 0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml) and -resistant S. pyogenes isolates, but HMR 3787 had lower MICs for ermB strains.
TI  - An observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. In recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. The aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. Subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. Overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. A total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. Among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), Streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates, 18%), Staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). The susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to 95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. The susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. In contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. We conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. In particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.
TI  - Detection of macrolide resistance mechanisms in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes using a multiplex rapid cycle PCR with microwell-format probe hybridization.
AB  - In this study, a multiplex rapid cycle PCR with microwell-format probe hybridization method was developed to perform high-volume screening for macrolide resistance determinants in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The method was then utilized to determine the distribution of macrolide resistance mechanisms in recent isolates of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes from Great Britain and Ireland. For 83 strains of macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae tested, 51 (61.4%) were positive for mef(A), 29 (34.9%) erm(B), two (2.4%) double mechanisms mef(A) + erm(B), and one (1.2%) negative for all mechanisms tested. For 56 strains of macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes tested, 33 (58.9%) were positive for erm(A) subclass erm(TR), 18 (32.1%) mef(A) and five (8.9%) erm(B).
TI  - The pavA gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae encodes a fibronectin-binding protein that is essential for virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx in up to 40% of healthy subjects, and is a leading cause of middle ear infections (otitis media), meningitis and pneumonia. Pneumococci adhere to glycosidic receptors on epithelial cells and to immobilized fibronectin, but the bacterial adhesins mediating these reactions are largely uncharacterized. In this report we describe a novel pneumococcal protein PavA, which binds fibronectin and is associated with pneumococcal adhesion and virulence. The pavA gene, present in 64 independent isolates of S. pneumoniae tested, encodes a 551 amino acid residue polypeptide with 67% identical amino acid sequence to Fbp54 protein in Streptococcus pyogenes. PavA localized to the pneumococcal cell outer surface, as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy, despite lack of conventional secretory or cell-surface anchorage signals within the primary sequence. Full-length recombinant PavA polypeptide bound to immobilized human fibronectin in preference to fluid-phase fibronectin, in a heparin-sensitive interaction, and blocked binding of wild-type pneumococcal cells to fibronectin. However, a C-terminally truncated PavA' polypeptide (362 aa residues) failed to bind fibronectin or block pneumococcal cell adhesion. Expression of pavA in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 conferred > sixfold increased cell adhesion levels to fibronectin over control JH2-2 cells. Isogenic mutants of S. pneumoniae, either abrogated in PavA expression or producing a 42 kDa C-terminally truncated protein, showed up to 50% reduced binding to immobilized fibronectin. Inactivation of pavA had no effects on growth rate, cell morphology, cell-surface physico-chemical properties, production of pneumolysin, autolysin, or surface proteins PspA and PsaA. Isogenic pavA mutants of encapsulated S. pneumoniae D39 were approximately 104-fold attenuated in virulence in the mouse sepsis model. These results provide evidence that PavA fibronectin-binding protein plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates in Argentina.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against 1,000 clinical isolates of 147 Streptococcus pneumoniae (115, penicilin susceptible; 26, intermediate penicillin-resistant and 6, penicillin-resistant), 127 Hemophilus influenzae (109, beta lactamasa non-producer; 18, beta lactamase producers), 95 Streptococcus pyogenes (6, azytromycin-resistant), 84 Moraxella catarrhalis (79, beta lactamase producers), 110 Staphilococcus aureus (89, methicillin-susceptible; 21, methicilin-resistant), 98 Eenterococcus faecalis and 339 Enterobacteriacea, (recovered from patients with respiratory tract infection; skin and soft tissue infection and urinary tract infection), was compared with the activities of four fluorquinolones and five other antimicrobial agents. Of the quinolones tested, gemifloxacin was the most potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin intermediate and resistant strains. Mic(90) values obtained for gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin and trvafloxacin were 0.03, 2, 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/L respectively. Gemifloxacin was 16 fold more potent than ciprofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 32 fold more potent than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes. When tested against Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Enterobacteriaceae, all the quinolones showed similar activity. Our results demonstrate that gemifloxacin has similar activity than the other quinolones tested against Gram-negative organisms and is considerably more potent against Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Prevalence and mechanism of resistance against macrolides and lincosamides in Streptococcus suis isolates.
AB  - Eighty-seven Streptococcus suis isolates recovered in 1999-2000 from diseased pigs, all from different farms, were screened for resistance against macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics by the disk diffusion and agar dilution test and a PCR assay, amplifying the ermB gene and the mefA/E gene. Seventy-one percent of the isolates showed constitutive resistance to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics (MLS(B)-phenotype). All these isolates were positive for the ermB gene in the PCR, but negative for the mefA/E gene. For all strains minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against five other antimicrobial agents were determined. All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Ninety-nine percent of the isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin and tiamulin. Eighty-five percent of the strains were resistant to doxycycline. A 540bp fragment of the ermB genes of eight S. suis strains was sequenced and compared with ermB genes of five S. pneumoniae and five S. pyogenes strains of human origin. A 100% homology was found between these fragments in seven S. suis, one S. pneumoniae and three of the S. pyogenes isolates. This study demonstrates that resistance against macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B is widespread in S. suis and mediated by ribosome methylation, encoded by the ermB gene.
TI  - Activity of the ketolide antibacterial telithromycin against typical community-acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the developed world. They cause considerable morbidity, resulting in a major impact on public health both clinically and socioeconomically. The bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with community-acquired RTIs are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, with Streptococcus pyogenes predominating in pharyngitis. Over the past years, each of these pathogens has developed mechanisms to evade susceptibility to antibacterials, leading to an alarming global increase in antibacterial resistance among these pathogens. There is great concern that currently available antibacterials are insufficient to treat community-acquired RTIs and there is an urgent requirement for new agents with activity against all strains of common community-acquired RTI pathogens. Telithromycin (HMR 3647) belongs to a new family of antibacterials, the ketolides, and has been specifically designed for the treatment of community-acquired RTIs. This review covers the potent in vitro activity of telithromycin against the most common community-acquired RTI pathogens compared with other currently available antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Relative potency of telithromycin, azithromycin and erythromycin against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A ketolide (telithromycin), an azalide (azithromycin) and a macrolide (erythromycin) were tested against 2,733 isolates of gram-positive cocci gathered from 11 different medical centers. Telithromycin was active against erythromycin-resistant staphylococci that were susceptible to clindamycin but was not active against those that were resistant to clindamycin. More than 99% of all Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were susceptible to 1 microg/ml of telithromycin including erythromycin- and azithromycin-resistant strains. Telithromycin was not only more potent than azithromycin against macrolide-susceptible strains, it was also active against most macrolide-resistant strains. Although the prevalence of macrolide-resistant pneumococci increased from 19% to 27% between 1997 and 1999, macrolide resistance among other gram-positive cocci did not change substantially in that 2-year period.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefditoren and other oral beta-lactams against nonpneumococcal streptococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In vitro studies of cefditoren activity have focused primarily on Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacterial species isolated from patients with respiratory infections, but relatively few reports have been published describing the activity of cefditoren against clinical isolates of nonpneumococcal streptococci. METHODS: Cefditoren activity was determined by broth microdilution (M7-A5, NCCLS, 2000) for 450 viridans group streptococci, 917 Streptococcus pyogenes and 800 other beta-hemolytic streptococci collected throughout the US during 1999-2000. RESULTS: Against viridans group streptococci, cefditoren (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml) was 4- to 32-fold more active than the other beta-lactams tested (penicillin ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefprozil and cefuroxime). The difference in activity between cefditoren and the other beta-lactams was greater for penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates (MIC(90s), 1 microg/ml versus 8-32 microg/ml) than among penicillin-susceptible isolates (MIC(90s), 0.12 versus 0.25- 1 microg/ml). Cefditoren also demonstrated potent activity against S. pyogenes (MIC(90), 0.015 microg/ml) and other beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(90), 0.06 microg/ml), comparable to that of the other beta-lactams. CONCLUSIONS: The activity demonstrated by cefditoren against nonpneumococcal streptococci, including beta-lactam- and macrolide-resistant isolates, suggests that this agent holds promise as therapy for infections caused by all clinically significant species of streptococci.
TI  - Comparison of once-daily versus twice-daily administration of cefdinir against typical bacterial respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - In an in vitro pharmacodynamic model, a twice-daily cefdinir dosing regimen was more effective than a once-daily regimen against common bacterial respiratory pathogens in producing 3-log(10) killing and preventing the occurrence of regrowth at 24 h. Twice-daily administration is likely the more appropriate cefdinir dosing strategy for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - A simple model host for identifying Gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  - We demonstrate the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several Gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or Streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult C. elegans. Focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both E. faecalis and E. faecium kill C. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only E. faecalis kills the adults. In the case of adults, a low inoculum of E. faecalis grows to a high titer in the C. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on E. faecium. Interestingly, a high titer of E. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. Two E. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. We exploit the apparent parallels between Gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an E. faecalis virulence factor, ScrB, which is relevant to mammalian pathogenesis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Microbiological profile of telithromycin, the first ketolide antimicrobial.
AB  - Telithromycin, the first of the ketolide antimicrobials, has been specifically designed to provide potent activity against common and atypical/intracellular or cell-associated respiratory pathogens, including those that are resistant to beta-lactams and/or macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminB (MLS(B)) antimicrobials. Against gram-positive cocci, telithromycin possesses more potent activity in vitro and in vivo than the macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin. It retains its activity against erm-(MLS(B)) or mef-mediated macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes and against Staphylococcus aureus resistant to macrolides through inducible MLS(B) mechanisms. Telithromycin also possesses high activity against the Gram-negative pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, regardless of beta-lactamase production. In vitro, it shows similar activity to azithromycin against H. influenzae, while in vivo its activity against H. influenzae is higher than that of azithromycin. Telithromycin's spectrum of activity also extends to the atypical, intracellular and cell-associated pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. In vitro, telithromycin does not induce MLS(B) resistance and it shows low potential to select for resistance or cross-resistance to other antimicrobials. These characteristics indicate that telithromycin will have an important clinical role in the empirical treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-773, a new ketolide, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - ABT-773 is a novel ketolide effective against antibacterial-resistant respiratory tract pathogens. The pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-773 was studied in rats and consisted of a mean peak concentration in plasma of 1.07 microg/ml and an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 12.03 microg. h/ml when the compound was delivered at a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight. It concentrated in rat lung tissue, with a lung tissue-to-plasma ratio of 29 based on the AUC. In acute systemic infections in mice, ABT-773 showed efficacy against macrolide-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Listeria monocytogenes. Additionally, ABT-773 improved the survival of mice infected with resistant S. pneumoniae containing either the ermB gene, the mefE gene, or altered penicillin binding protein genes. In a rat lung model of infection, ABT-773 demonstrated 50% effective doses lower than those of comparator macrolides when evaluated against the following strains of S. pneumoniae: a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-susceptible strain, an ermB strain, and an mefE strain. ABT-773 was also effective against Haemophilus influenzae lung infections in rats. Thus, ABT-773 may prove to be a useful new antibacterial agent for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters for antimicrobial effects of cefotaxime and amoxicillin in an in vitro kinetic model.
AB  - An in vitro kinetic model was used to study the relation between pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) parameters for antimicrobial effect, e.g., the time above MIC (T>MIC), maximum concentration in serum (C(max)), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli were exposed to cefotaxime, and the activity of amoxicillin against four strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae with different susceptibilities to penicillin was studied. The drug elimination rate varied so that the T>MIC ranged from 20 to 100% during 24 h, while the AUC and/or the initial concentration (C(max)) were kept constant. For S. pyogenes and E. coli, the maximal antimicrobial effect (E(max)) at 24 h occurred when the antimicrobial concentration exceeded the MIC for 50 and 80% of the strains tested, respectively. The penicillin-susceptible pneumococci (MIC, 0.03 mg/liter) and the penicillin-intermediate strain (MIC, 0.25 mg/liter) showed maximal killing by amoxicillin at a T>MIC of 50%. For a strain for which the MIC was 2 mg/liter, C(max) needed to be increased to achieve the E(max). Under the condition that C(max) was 10 times the MIC, E(max) was obtained at a T>MIC of 60%, indicating that C(max), in addition to T>MIC, may be an important parameter for antimicrobial effect on moderately penicillin-resistant pneumococci. For the strain for which the MIC was 4 mg/liter, the reduction of bacteria varied from -0.4 to -3.6 log(10) CFU/ml at a T>MIC of 100%, despite an initial antimicrobial concentration of 10 times the MIC. Our studies have shown that the in vitro kinetic model is a useful complement to animal models for studying the PK-PD relationship for antimicrobial effect of antibiotics.

TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT-773 versus macrolides and quinolones against resistant respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - ABT-773, a novel ketolide, was compared to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and gemifloxacin against antibiotic-resistant strains recently isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections. MICs were determined by agar dilution using standard NCCLS methodology. ABT-773 (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L) was more active than the macrolides (MIC(90) > or = 2 mg/L) and fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) > or = 0.5 mg/L) against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The fluoroquinolones were the most active agents tested against beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90) < or = 0.01-0.06 mg/L), against which ABT-773 (MIC(90) 4 mg/L) was comparable to azithromycin and two- and four-fold more active than erythromycin and clarithromycin, respectively. Against beta-lactamase positive Moraxella catarrhalis, the activity of ABT-773 (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L) was comparable to gemifloxacin, trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) 0.03-0.06 mg/L) and 4- to eightfold greater than that of clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, and erythromycin. These data suggest ABT-773 could be a valuable compound for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including those resistant to usual oral therapy.
TI  - alpha-Enolase of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a plasmin(ogen)-binding protein displayed on the bacterial cell surface.
AB  - Binding of human plasminogen to Streptococcus pneumoniae and its subsequent activation promotes penetration of bacteria through reconstituted basement membranes. In this study, we have characterized a novel pneumococcal surface protein with a molecular mass of 47 kDa, designated Eno, which specifically binds human plasmin(ogen), exhibits alpha-enolase activity and is necessary for viability. Using enzyme assays, we have confirmed the alpha-enolase activity of both pneumococcal surface-displayed Eno and purified recombinant Eno protein. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated the presence of Eno in the cytoplasm as well as on the surface of encapsulated and unencapsulated pneumococci. Plasminogen-binding activity was demonstrated with whole pneumococcal cells and purified Eno protein. Binding of activated plasminogen was also shown for Eno; however, the affinity for plasmin is significantly reduced compared with plasminogen. Results from competitive inhibition assays indicate that binding is mediated through the lysine binding sites in plasmin(ogen). Carboxypeptidase B treatment and amino acid substitutions of the C-terminal lysyl residues of Eno indicated that the C-terminal lysine is pivotal for plasmin(ogen)-binding activity. Eno is ubiquitously distributed among pneumococcal serotypes, and binding experiments suggested the reassociation of secreted Eno to the bacterial cell surface. The reassociation was also confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. The results suggest a mechanism of plasminogen activation for human pathogens that might contribute to their virulence potential in invasive infectious processes.

TI  - [Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (Zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  - Azithromycin (Zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in Japan in March 2000. It showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Its activity against H. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. After oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. Its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of S. aureus. In experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. These pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ABT-773, a novel antibacterial ketolide.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ABT-773, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin were compared. ABT-773 was the most active compound against macrolide-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. It also had good activity against gram-negative and atypical respiratory tract pathogens and Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of acute otitis media in Chilean children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a main cause for antimicrobial prescription in Latin America. Pathogen diversity in different geographic regions underscores the need for updated knowledge on AOM microbiology. AIM: To prospectively determine the role of bacteria and viruses in Chilean children with AOM. METHODS: Between July, 1998, and June, 1999, children >3 months with a presumptive diagnosis of AOM were referred to the study ear, nose and throat physician. Middle ear fluid and nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from children with confirmed AOM and processed for common bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and viruses. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were determined. RESULTS: An ear, nose and throat physician confirmed diagnoses for 222 (42%) of 529 children referred with diagnosis of AOM, and 170 children met eligibility criteria for the study. One or more pathogens were detected in 140 of 170 (82%) children. Predominant bacteria were S. pneumoniae (37%), Haemophilus influenzae (24%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (13%). M. catarrhalis was detected in 2 children, C. pneumoniae was found in 1 and M. pneumoniae was not detected. Viruses were detected in 22 children (13%) from nasopharyngeal aspirates, and in 6 of them the same virus was detected in middle ear fluid. Penicillin-resistant (intermediate and high) S. pneumoniae represented 40% of isolates and 10% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. All 10 penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains were resistant to cefuroxime. Eighteen S. pneumoniae serotypes were detected and 19F was associated with high level penicillin resistance. CONCLUSION: This study can impact local management of AOM, and it should encourage continuous surveillance of AOM microbiology in Chile and other developing countries.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of thiamphenicol-glycinate and thiamphenicol-glycinate-acetylcysteinate and other antimicrobials against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Thiamphenicol-glycinate-acetylcysteinate (TGA; CAS 20192-91-0) is widely used for the treatment of infections of varied aetiology. The aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol-glycinate (TG; CAS 15318-45-3), TGA, amoxicillin (CAS 61336-70-7) plus clavulanic acid (CAS 58001-44-8), azithromycin (CAS 83905-01-5) and ceftriaxone (CAS 104376-79-6). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methods. The effects of changes in assay conditions were also examined. The activity of TG and TGA was similar to that of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, with the exception of methicillin resistant S. aureus. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were characterised by a limited activity against gram-positive cocci and methicillin resistant and cefinase-positive S. aureus, respectively. TG and TGA are characterized by a wide spectrum of activity, comparable to that of recent commercialized antibiotics for treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  - In vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in Europe and Australia.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826, L-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. Its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in Europe and Australia, with imipenem, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. Ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. Ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and Moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its MIC(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most Enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. Ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional NCCLS MIC breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them Enterobacter aerogenes. Resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 Bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 Clostridium difficile strain. Ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which MICs were as high as 2 microg/ml. Of 234 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem MICs of 2 microg/ml and one required an MIC of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-Streptococcus pyogenes, non-Streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem MICs of 2 and 16 microg/ml. These streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem. The Etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major constituents against respiratory tract pathogens by gaseous contact.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major constituents in the gaseous state was evaluated against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. For most essential oils examined, H. influenzae was most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and then S. aureus. Penicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. pneumoniae were comparable in susceptibility. Escherichia coli, which was used as a control, showed least susceptibility. A minimal inhibitory dose (MID) was introduced as a measure of the vapour activity. Among 14 essential oils, cinnamon bark, lemon-grass and thyme oils showed the lowest MID, followed by essential oils containing terpene alcohols as major constituents. The essential oils containing terpene ketone, ether and, in particular, hydrocarbon had high MIDS. The vapour activity on short exposure was comparable to that following overnight exposure, and rapid evaporation was more effective than slow evaporation of essential oils. The vapour concentration and absorption into agar of essential oils reached a maximum 1 or 2 h after rapid evaporation. These results indicate that the antibacterial action of essential oils was most effective when at high vapour concentration for a short time.
TI  - Nationwide German multicenter study on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in streptococcal blood isolates from neutropenic patients and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobials.
AB  - In a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. Streptococcus oralis (26.3%), S. pneumoniae (26.3%), S. agalactiae (11.5%), S. mitis (9%), and S. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. Four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. One strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (MIC, 8 mg/liter). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among S. oralis (14.6%), S. mitis (7.1%), and S. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes. Resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%. Quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; MIC(90), 1 mg/liter, MIC range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).
TI  - Linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the United States. It is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. It also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. METHODS: Using the terms linezolid, PNU-100766, and oxazolidinone, we performed a literature search of the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to September 2000), HealthSTAR (1993 to September 2000), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966 to September 2000), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2000), PharmaProjects (January 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). RESULTS: Linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. Consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. It is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. To date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent requiring dose adjustment. Linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. Reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. Preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. Due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.
TI  - Bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for treatment of acute otitis media.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T/S) has often been used as first and  second line of treatment for acute otitis media (AOM). Because of the increasing resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae to T/S, we undertook the present study to investigate the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of this drug in AOM. METHODS: Fifty-four culture-positive evaluable patients ages 3 to 32 months with AOM were treated with T/S 4/20 mg/kg in two divided daily doses for 10 days. Middle ear fluid (MEF) was cultured at enrollment (Day 1) and on Days 4 and 5 after initiation of treatment. Additional MEF cultures were obtained if clinical relapse occurred. Clinical failure was determined when the symptoms and signs of AOM did not improve or recurred during therapy. Bacteriologic failure was defined by positive culture on Days 4 and 5, or negative on Days 4 and 5 but positive again before the end of treatment. Patients were followed until Day 28 +/- 2. RESULTS: A total of 67 organisms were isolated from MEF specimens of the 54 study patients: S. pneumoniae, 24; H. influenzae, 40; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 3. Fifteen (63%) of 24 S. pneumoniae were nonsusceptible to T/S (trimethoprim MIC, >0.5 microg/ml), of which 10 (67%) were highly resistant to T/S (trimethoprim MIC, > or = 4.0 microg/ml). Twelve (30%) of 40 H. influenzae and all 3 S. pyogenes isolates were nonsusceptible to T/S (MIC > or = 4.0 microg/ml). Bacteriologic eradication occurred in 9 of 9 (100%) and 27 of 27 (100%) T/S-susceptible S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively, vs. 4 of 15 (27%) and 6 of 12 (50%) T/S-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively (P < 0.001). The 3 patients with S. pyogenes failed bacteriologically. Nine new organisms, not initially isolated, emerged during treatment, 7 of which (77%) were resistant to T/S. Altogether bacteriologic failure (organisms not eradicated plus newly emerged) occurred in 29 (53%) of 54 patients. Clinical failures occurred in 8 (15%) of 54 patients, and in 7 of these 8 cases the clinical failures occurred in those with bacteriologic failures. Ten patients relapsed clinically after completion of treatment and in 8 of them tympanocentesis for MEF culture was performed. Six of these 8 cultures were positive, and the initial pathogen was isolated in 4 of 6 (67%). CONCLUSIONS: A high bacteriologic failure rate as well as a considerable clinical failure rate occurred among patients with AOM treated with T/S. We believe that T/S is no longer an appropriate empiric choice for the treatment of AOM in regions where high T/S resistance among respiratory pathogens is reported.
TI  - Differentiation of resistance phenotypes among erythromycin-resistant Pneumococci.
AB  - Laboratory differentiation of erythromycin resistance phenotypes is poorly standardized for pneumococci. In this study, 85 clinical isolates of erythromycin-resistant (MIC > or = 1 microg/ml) Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested for the resistance phenotype by the erythromycin-clindamycin double-disk test (previously used to determine the macrolide resistance phenotype in Streptococcus pyogenes strains) and by MIC induction tests, i.e., by determining the MICs of macrolide antibiotics without and with pre-exposure to 0.05 microg of erythromycin per ml. By the double-disk test, 65 strains, all carrying the erm(AM) determinant, were assigned to the constitutive macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance (cMLS) phenotype, and the remaining 20, all carrying the mef(E) gene, were assigned to the recently described M phenotype; an inducible MLS resistance (iMLS) phenotype was not found. The lack of inducible resistance to clindamycin was confirmed by determining clindamycin MICs without and with pre-exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin. In macrolide MIC and MIC-induction tests, whereas homogeneous susceptibility patterns were observed among the 20 strains assigned to the M phenotype by the double-disk test, two distinct patterns were recognized among the 65 strains assigned to the cMLS phenotype by the same test; one pattern (n = 10; probably that of the true cMLS isolates) was characterized by resistance to rokitamycin also without induction, and the other pattern (n = 55; designated the iMcLS phenotype) was characterized by full or intermediate susceptibility to rokitamycin without induction turning to resistance after induction, with an MIC increase by more than three dilutions. A triple-disk test, set up by adding a rokitamycin disk to the erythromycin and clindamycin disks of the double-disk test, allowed the easy differentiation not only of pneumococci with the M phenotype from those with MLS resistance but also, among the latter, of those of the true cMLS phenotype from those of the iMcLS phenotype. While distinguishing MLS from M resistance in pneumococci is easily and reliably achieved, the differentiation of constitutive from inducible MLS resistance is far more uncertain and is strongly affected by the antibiotic used to test inducibility.
TI  - The relationship between trends in macrolide use and resistance to macrolides of  common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The correlation between increased macrolide consumption and the resistance of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis to macrolides in Slovenia from 1994 to 1999 was evaluated. The outpatient consumption of macrolides increased from 1.89 to 3.84 defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/day during the observation period. This increase in macrolide consumption was paralleled by a steady increase in macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes (from 0 to 7.4%, r = 0.90, P = 0.014) and upper respiratory S. pneumoniae isolates (from 0 to 9%, r = 0.82, P = 0.044). In other pathogens studied, no significant increase was detected.
TI  - rho is not essential for viability or virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We have identified the gene for transcription termination factor Rho in Staphylococcus aureus. Deletion of rho in S. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. We also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of Rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. Exceptions include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, all of which appear not to possess a Rho homolog. Complementation studies indicate that S. aureus Rho possesses the same activity as Escherichia coli Rho and that the Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against S. aureus Rho. Our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: steps to reduce the problem with emphasis on antibiotic utilization the Rapid City experience.
AB  - In summary, as the SHEA/IDSA Joint Committee on Prevention of Antimicrobial Resistance suggested, it should be easier to prevent the acquisition of resistance than to respond after the problem is extensive. We have taken that approach in the measures undertaken and outlined above. Our lower rates of resistant microorganisms are, in part, due to this, but also due to the diligent use of antibiotics by the medical staff-largely in avoiding empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy when not needed. Our formulary is not restrictive but new antibiotics are not added unless there is a proven niche. The most appropriate and effective antibiotic at our hospital for Streptococcus pneumoniae is penicillin, for Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin, for Staphylococcus aureus, nafcillin, for a severe Escherichia Coli infection, gentamicin, and for Pseudomonas aeurginosa, gentamicin and ceftazidime. Our efforts are to maintain this favorable situation for our patients and clinicians. Additionally, we will continue to explore and implement new avenues of prevention, with an emphasis on optimal antibiotic utilization, toward the goal of protecting our patients and health care workers from resistant bacteria.
TI  - Investigation of antimicrobial activity of essential oils of several Macedonian Thymus L. species (Lamiaceae).
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of twenty specimens of essential oils of eleven Thymus species, naturally occurring in the Macedonian flora, was investigated by agar diffusion and broth dilution methods. Inhibition of growth and microbicidal action was examined on three Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In spite of wide variability in essential oil composition, ranging from traces of thymol to the amount of about 50% thymol in oils, all examined samples of Thymus essential oil possessed strong antibacterial activity. Zones of inhibition of growth (for 25% dilution of oils) was from 10-54 mm in diameters. MICs ranging from 0.012-0.1% while MMCs were from 0.025-0.4% for essential oils that contained large amounts of phenols and 0.2-1.6% for those which contained traces of phenols and large amounts of geraniol, linalool and (Z + E)-citral.
TI  - Susceptibility to selected antibiotics of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  
TI  - [A comparative study of antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin against clinical isolates].
AB  - Ceftibuten is an orally active third generation new cephalosporin. Its antibacterial activity in vitro was tested to many clinical isolates and was compared to the activity of ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin, by twofold serial dilution method in Muller-Hinton agar--detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and by the disc-diffusion method of Kirby-Bauer. The new cephalosporin demonstrated great activity against the different clinical important strains. Many resistant strains to ampicillin were high susceptible to ceftibuten. The majority of Gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacteriaceae, the respiratory pathogens M.(B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae are highly susceptible to Ceftibuten, however Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter are resistant. The majority of methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus are resistant too. New cephallosporin was also active against S. pyogenes (Streptococcus gr. A) and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, but was inactive against S. agalactiae (Streptococcus gr. B), S. pneumoniae penicillin-resistant strains and enterococci, similar to the other cephalosporins. The activity of ceftibuten was higher than that of ampicillin and cefuroxime against beta-lactamases positive strains of H. influenzae and M.(B) catarrhalis, also against tested strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The major priority of the new antibacterial agent over other cephalosporins and ampicillin is its stability to hydrolysis by the main broad-spectrum beta-lactamases producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae sp.
TI  - Evidence for symmetric chromosomal inversions around the replication origin in bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whole-genome comparisons can provide great insight into many aspects  of biology. Until recently, however, comparisons were mainly possible only between distantly related species. Complete genome sequences are now becoming available from multiple sets of closely related strains or species. RESULTS: By comparing the recently completed genome sequences of Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to those of closely related species - Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes and Mycobacterium leprae, respectively - we have identified an unusual and previously unobserved feature of bacterial genome structure. Scatterplots of the conserved sequences (both DNA and protein) between each pair of species produce a distinct X-shaped pattern, which we call an X-alignment. The key feature of these alignments is that they have symmetry around the replication origin and terminus; that is, the distance of a particular conserved feature (DNA or protein) from the replication origin (or terminus) is conserved between closely related pairs of species. Statistically significant X-alignments are also found within some genomes, indicating that there is symmetry about the replication origin for paralogous features as well. CONCLUSIONS: The most likely mechanism of generation of X-alignments involves large chromosomal inversions that reverse the genomic sequence symmetrically around the origin of replication. The finding of these X-alignments between many pairs of species suggests that chromosomal inversions around the origin are a common feature of bacterial genome evolution.
TI  - In vitro development of resistance to six quinolones in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were exposed to subinhibitory MICs of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, clinafloxacin, and gemifloxacin during a 10-day period. Subculturing led to resistance development, regardless of the initial potencies of the quinolones. None of the quinolones was associated with a significantly slower rate of resistance development.
TI  - In vitro activities of the novel ketolide telithromycin (HMR 3647) against erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus species.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 184 erythromycin-resistant streptococci to a novel ketolide, telithromycin (HMR 3647), were tested. These clinical isolates included 111 Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 group C streptococcus, 18 group G streptococcus, and 37 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. The MICs for all but eight S. pyogenes strains were < or =0.5 microg/ml, indicating that telithromycin is active in vitro against erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus strains. All strains for which MICs were > or =1 microg/ml had an erm(B) resistance gene and six strains for which MICs were > or =4 microg/ml had a constitutive erm(B) gene (MIC range, 4 to 64 microg/ml). Interestingly, for S. pneumoniae strains with a constitutive erm(B) gene, MICs were < or =0.25 microg/ml (MIC range, < or =0.008 to 0.25 microg/ml). Our in vitro data show that for S. pyogenes strains which constitutively express the erm(B) methylase gene, MICs are so high that the strains might be clinically resistant to telithromycin.
TI  - Telithromycin: a new ketolide antimicrobial for treatment of respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial, specifically developed for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. It has a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against common respiratory pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. It also has activity against atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Telithromycin maintains activity against beta-lactam and macrolide-resistant respiratory tract pathogens and does not appear to induce cross-resistance to other members of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) group of antimicrobials. It demonstrates bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and has a prolonged concentration-dependent post-antibiotic effect (PAE) in vitro. The drug has favourable pharmacokinetics following oral administration. It is well absorbed, achieves good plasma levels and is highly concentrated in pulmonary tissues and white blood cells. In clinical trials, telithromycin given orally at a dose of 800 mg once daily for 5 - 10 days was as effective as comparator antimicrobials for the treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis and group A-beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis. The adverse events and safety profile were similar to comparator antimicrobials. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea, headache and dizziness. Telithromycin should provide an effective, convenient and well-tolerated once-daily oral therapy for treatment of respiratory infections.
TI  - Pharyngeal colonization prevalence rates for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae in a respiratory chemoprophylaxis intervention study using azithromycin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A prospective assessment of the pharyngeal colonization prevalence rates for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae before and after an azithromycin chemoprophylaxis intervention clinical trial in a cohort of US Marine Corps trainees. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all streptococcal isolates, for azithromycin, penicillin, erythromycin and cefotaxime are reported. METHODS: Between November 1994 and March 1995, 1108 asymptomatic male US Marine Corps trainees, located in Southern California, were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: (1) weekly oral azithromycin, 500 mg (n = 362); (2) 1.2 MU benzathine penicillin G, intramuscularly once (n = 374); or (3) no chemoprophylaxis (n = 372). Subjects provided both a pre- and post-training pharyngeal culture and microbial analysis was conducted to determine the colonization status of each study subject. RESULTS: The pretraining colonization prevalence was 1.2% for S. pneumoniae and 2.4% for S. pyogenes. There was no statistical difference in pretraining prevalence between the three treatment groups for either organism. Post-training pharyngeal cultures revealed an overall prevalence of 1.1% with no difference between treatment arms. However, the overall post-training prevalence of S. pyogenes colonization increased to 4.8%, with the azithromycin group having significant evidence of protection (0.7%) in comparison with the no-treatment group (8.2%). The Etest method demonstrated no significant difference in the MIC50, MIC90, and MIC ranges between pre- and post-training isolates for any of the tested drugs. CONCLUSION: The use of azithromycin as a chemoprophylactic agent to reduce the colonization and subsequent infection of streptococcal respiratory disease among healthy adult male military recruits may be beneficial.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of moxifloxacin compared to grepafloxacin and clarithromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes investigated using an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to study and compare the killing activity of two new fluoroquinolone compounds, moxifloxacin and grepafloxacin, and a new generation macrolide, clarithromycin, against three clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant) and two Streptococcus pyogenes (erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant) strains by simulating their human pharmacokinetics in a pharmacodynamic model. Results were achieved by measuring the reduction in viable bacterial count during the 24-h experimental period. All three antimicrobials led to a continuous reduction in the bacterial counts of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae and erythromycin-susceptible S. pyogenes strains, the maximal reduction observed after 8-10 hours being 5-6 logs for moxifloxacin and 3 logs for grepafloxacin; clarithromycin exhibited a similar reduction of 5 logs only after 24 h. No regrowth was observed for any strain after 24 h with any of the antibiotics. The bactericidal activity of both the fluoroquinolones was not affected by penicillin resistance of S. pneumoniae and erythromycin resistance of S. pyogenes. In contrast, clarithromycin was not able to reduce the bacterial count of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes strains. Moxifloxacin exhibited, within 24 h, higher and faster bactericidal activity than grepafloxacin and clarithromycin against S. pneumoniae, and was not affected by penicillin resistance. These results suggest that moxifloxacin is a promising new agent for treatment of streptococcal infections.
TI  - [Orbital and periorbital cellulitis. Review of 107 cases].
AB  - AIM: To report the epidemiology, clinical features, management and complications  of orbital and periorbital cellulitis; to evaluate the use of imaging tests in the detection of complications. METHODS: Retrospective study of 107 pediatric patients admitted to the San Joan de Deu Pediatric Hospital with orbital or periorbital cellulitis from January 1991 to January 1999. RESULTS: The incidence of cellulitis was highest in the second year of life and during winter. No significant differences were found between the sexes. In 68 patients (63.6%) the cause of cellulitis was identified as sinusitis. The most frequently identified organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Computed tomography identified retroseptal damage in 36 patients with 23 super osteal abscesses, 3 orbital abscesses and 3 intracranial complications. Sixty nine percent of the patients were treated with a single antibiotic (cefotaxime, cefuroxime or amoxicillin clavulanic acid) while 31% underwent multiple antibiotic therapy. Only 8.4% required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital cellulitis is a relatively common and potentially serious disease in children. The early use of CT to assess the extent of damage is important in establishing prognosis and in assessing the need for surgical therapy.
TI  - Cefdinir: an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of cefdinir, an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-November 1999) of the medical literature, review of English-language literature and bibliographies of these articles, and product information. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Additional information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir was also reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cefdinir, an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and -positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. Cefdinir is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia) and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse event profile is similar to that of comparator agents. CONCLUSIONS: Cefdinir is a second-line alternative to first-line antimicrobial agents, with convenient once- or twice-daily dosing in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of many beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and policy in Belgium.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in Belgium. A few examples to illustrate this problem: S. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; Salmonella and Campylobacter are becoming more and more resistant to the fluoroquinolones. In hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the Belgian hospitals. Antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. The popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". Infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. In this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. We will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens Salmonella and Campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen E. coli. This resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. In Belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. Our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. This information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. A unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. However, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. Therefore, a Coordination Commission for Antibiotic Policy was installed recently by the Ministers of Social Affairs, Public Health and Agriculture.
TI  - Five-day twice daily cefdinir therapy for acute otitis media: microbiologic and clinical efficacy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the microbiologic and clinical efficacy of a 5-day course of cefdinir in the treatment of tympanocentesis-documented acute otitis media (AOM). DESIGN: Open label noncomparative trial. SETTING: Primary care, ambulatory. PATIENTS: Children ages 6 months through 12 years with signs of AOM and middle ear effusion confirmed by tympanometry in at least one ear. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent tympanocentesis at baseline and received cefdinir 7 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presumptive eradication of middle ear pathogens determined by clinical cure of signs and symptoms of AOM at end of therapy (Study Days 7 to 9) and Visit 3 (Study Days 16 to 21). RESULTS: A total of 125 of 177 enrolled children had 134 pathogens isolated by tympanocentesis: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 69 (51.5%); Haemophilus influenzae 44 (32.8%; beta-lactamase-positive in 18 of 44 strains); beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella catarrhalis, 15 (11.2%); and Streptococcus pyogenes, 6 (4.5%). The clinical cure rates by patient in the microbiologically and overall clinically evaluable groups, respectively, were 73% (84 of 115) and 77.4% (130 of 168) at the end of therapy visit and 57.4% (66 of 115) and 61.9% (104 of 168) at Visit 3. Presumptive eradication rates at end of therapy were 8 of 11 (72.7%) and 4 of 8 (50%) for patients with penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. Adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients, with diarrhea (11%) occurring most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-day regimen of cefdinir was effective in the eradication of the common causative pathogens of nonrefractory AOM, including intermediate penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Cefdinir should be considered a suitable second line antibiotic for AOM.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of certain plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
AB  - Eighteen crude extracts, including six hexanic, six chloroformic and six methanolic from six different plant species used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory infections, were evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for each extract using a two-fold dilution assay. The results showed that 16 crude extracts (89%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested at concentrations of 5 mg/ml or below. The extracts from Gnaphalium oxyphyllum, Gnaphalium americanum, and Crescentia alata possessed strong antimicrobial activity against the pathogens tested.
TI  - Group A streptococcal growth phase-associated virulence factor regulation by a novel operon (Fas) with homologies to two-component-type regulators requires a small RNA molecule.
AB  - A novel growth phase-associated two-component-type regulator, Fas (fibronectin/fibrinogen binding/haemolytic activity/streptokinase regulator), of Streptococcus pyogenes was identified in the M1 genome sequence, based on homologies to the histidine protein kinase (HPK) and response regulator (RR) part of the Staphylococcus aureus Agr and Streptococcus pneumoniae Com quorum-sensing systems. The fas operon, present in all 12 tested M serotypes, was transcribed as polycystronic message (fasBCA) and contained genes encoding two potential HPKs (FasB and FasC) and one RR (FasA). Downstream of fasBCA, we identified a small 300 nucleotide monocistronic transcript, designated fasX, that did not appear to encode true peptide sequences. Measurements of luciferase promoter fusions revealed a growth phase-associated transcription of fasBCA and fasX, with peak activities during the late exponential phase. Insertional mutagenesis disrupting fasBCA and fasA led to a phenotype similar to agr-null mutations in S. aureus, with prolonged expression of extracellular matrix protein-binding adhesins and reduced expression of secreted virulence factors such as streptokinase and streptolysin S. In addition, fasX transcription was dependent on the RR FasA; however, deletion mutagenesis of fasX resulted in a similar phenotype to that of the fasBCA or fasA mutants. Complementation of the fasX deletion mutant, with the fasX gene expressed in trans from a plasmid, restored the wild-type fasBCA regulation pattern. This strongly suggested that fasX, a putative non-translated RNA, is the main effector molecule of the fas regulon. However, using spent culture supernatants from wild-type and fas mutant strains, we were not able to show an influence on the logarithmic growth phase expression of fas and dependent genes. Thus, despite structural and functional similarities between fas and agr, to date the fas operon appears not to be involved in group A streptococcal (GAS) quorum-sensing regulation.
TI  - Recombination within natural populations of pathogenic bacteria: short-term empirical estimates and long-term phylogenetic consequences.
AB  - The identification of clones within bacterial populations is often taken as evidence for a low rate of recombination, but the validity of this inference is rarely examined. We have used statistical tests of congruence between gene trees to examine the extent and significance of recombination in six bacterial pathogens. For Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. The lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter were not possible for Strep. pyogenes). In contrast, gene trees constructed for Hemophilus influenzae and pathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli showed a higher degree of congruence, suggesting lower rates of recombination. The impact of recombination therefore varies between bacterial species but in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in gene trees.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of signal peptidase I from gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Bacterial signal peptidase I is responsible for proteolytic processing of the precursors of secreted proteins. The enzymes from gram-negative and -positive bacteria are different in structure and specificity. In this study, we have cloned, expressed, and purified the signal peptidase I of gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae. The precursor of streptokinase, an extracellular protein produced in pathogenic streptococci, was identified as a substrate of S. pneumoniae signal peptidase I. Phospholipids were found to stimulate the enzymatic activity. Mutagenetic analysis demonstrated that residues serine 38 and lysine 76 of S. pneumoniae signal peptidase I are critical for enzyme activity and involved in the active site to form a serine-lysine catalytic dyad, which is similar to LexA-like proteases and Escherichia coli signal peptidase I. Similar to LexA-like proteases, S. pneumoniae signal peptidase I catalyzes an intermolecular self-cleavage in vitro, and an internal cleavage site has been identified between glycine 36 and histidine 37. Sequence analysis revealed that the signal peptidase I and LexA-like proteases show sequence homology around the active sites and some common properties around the self-cleavage sites. All these data suggest that signal peptidase I and LexA-like proteases are closely related and belong to a novel class of serine proteases.
TI  - Identification of an erm(A) erythromycin resistance methylase gene in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in Greece.
AB  - In a serotype 11A clone of erythromycin-resistant pneumococci isolated from young Greek carriers, we identified the nucleotide sequence of erm(A), a methylase gene previously described as erm(TR) in Streptococcus pyogenes. The erm(A) pneumococci were resistant to 14- and 15-member macrolides, inducibly resistant to clindamycin, and susceptible to streptogramin B. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of resistance to erythromycin in S. pneumoniae attributed solely to the carriage of the erm(A) gene.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of telithromycin In vitro against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Telithromycin (HMR 3647) is a new ketolide that belongs to a new class of semisynthetic 14-membered-ring macrolides which have expanded activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. The aim of the present study was to investigate different basic pharmacodynamic properties of this new compound. The following studies of telithromycin were performed: (i) studies of the rate and extent of killing of respiratory tract pathogens with different susceptibilities to erythromycin and penicillin exposed to a fixed concentration that corresponds to a dose of 800 mg in humans, (ii) studies of the rate and extent of killing of telithromycin at five different concentrations, (iii) studies of the rate and extent of killing of the same pathogens at three different inocula, (iv) studies of the postantibiotic effect and the postantibiotic sub-MIC effect of telithromycin, and (v) determination of the rate and extent of killing of telithromycin in an in vitro kinetic model. In conclusion, telithromycin exerted an extremely fast killing of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae both with static concentrations and in the in vitro kinetic model. A slower killing of the strains of Streptococcus pyogenes was noted, with regrowth in the kinetic model of a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-inducible strain. The strains of Haemophilus influenzae were not killed at all at a concentration of 0.6 mg/liter due to high MICs. A time-dependent killing was seen for all strains. No inoculum effect was seen for the strains of S. pneumoniae, with a 99.9% reduction in the numbers of CFU for all inocula at both 8 h and 24 h. The killing of the strains of S. pyogenes was reduced by 1 log(10) CFU at 8 h and 2 to 3 log(10) CFU at 24 h when the two lower inocula were used but not at all at 8 and 24 h when the highest inoculum was used. For both of the H. influenzae strains there was an inoculum effect, with 1 to 2 log(10) CFU less killing for the inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml in comparison to that for the inoculum of 10(6) CFU/ml. Overall, telithromycin exhibited long postantibiotic effects and postantibiotic sub-MIC effects for all strains investigated.
TI  - In vitro activity of ketolides telithromycin and HMR 3004 against italian isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with different erythromycin susceptibility.
AB  - Two ketolides, telithromycin and HMR 3004, were evaluated for their in vitro activity against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. On the basis of their resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics, erythromycin-resistant test strains were assigned to the constitutive resistance (cMLS) phenotype, the inducible resistance (iMLS) phenotype or the M phenotype. iMLS S. pyogenes strains were further subdivided into the three recently described subtypes iMLS-A, -B and -C. Telithromycin and HMR 3004 were uniformly and highly active against pneumococci (regardless of their susceptibility or resistance to erythromycin and/or penicillin), erythromycin-susceptible S. pyogenes and erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes strains of the M phenotype (in which resistance is mediated by an efflux system) or iMLS-B or -C phenotype (in which resistance is mediated by a methylase encoded by the ermTR gene). Both ketolides were less active against erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes strains with the cMLS phenotype or the iMLS-A subtype (where resistance is mediated by a methylase encoded by the ermAM gene), these strains ranging in phenotype from the upper limits of susceptibility to low-level resistant.
TI  - Ribosomal Resistance: Emerging Problems and Potential Solutions.
AB  - Many systemic antibiotics use ribosomal inhibition to suppress the replication of bacteria. Current research suggests that resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) antibiotics is emerging among clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin methylases, encoded by erm genes, modify an essential adenine residue in 23S rRNA and confer cross-resistance to MLS(B) antibiotics. More recently, macrolide efflux (mef) genes were identified in isolates of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae that show resistance to 14- and 15-membered macrolides (M phenotype). Resistance to MLSB has been associated with the increased use of erythromycin, and the recent emergence of the M phenotype has coincided with the marketing of newer macrolides. However, despite increasing macrolide resistance among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae, convincing data on treatment failures directly attributable to MLS(B) or M phenotypes are limited. Possible solutions to emerging MLS(B) and M phenotype resistance include the introduction of alternative antibiotics, the more prudent use of antibiotics, combination therapy, molecular diagnostics, enhanced understanding of pharmacodynamic variables, and redefined resistance breakpoints.
TI  - Emerging and reemerging pathogens.
AB  - From 1973 to 1995, 29 new and reemerging pathogenic microbes were recognized. However, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. Many of what we refer to as emerging diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. Thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of Legionella pneumophila infections. New diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. We summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (MDR tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes).
TI  - Epidemiological survey of bacterial resistance in upper respiratory tract infections in italy.
AB  - The vast majority of infections in the upper airways are caused by four bacterial species;, in Italy as elsewhere, antibiotics resistant strains are emerging. Enzymatic resistance to beta-lactams in Haemophilus influenzae is becoming more important and affects 15% of isolates. On the other hand less than 0.3% of H. influenzae strains are fluoroquinolone-resistant. The number of beta-lactamase-producing Moraxella catarrhalis strains in Italy has been thought to be lower than in other countries, but recent studies suggest 90% of strains are positive, a figure similar to figures reported in the international literature. The most recent data estimate high-level resistance to penicillin in pneumococci to be around 5%, but varies greatly in different geographical areas and with the different origins of the isolates. In spite of the low incidence of penicillin-resistant strains, the most recent figures for macrolide-resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae range from 26.4 to 31.7%. More than 3 years after the dramatic increase in erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, the resistance levels in Italy are still among the highest in the world. Unlike the experience in other countries, resistance is often related not to the active efflux of antibiotic from the bacterial cell but to ribosomal methylation, thus affecting not only 14- and 15-membered macrolides, but also 16-membered compounds and lincosamides.
TI  - Immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'Dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  - The immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. In this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. A long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. The influence of orally given Dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. A two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. In immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, IgG) and coproantibodies (predominantly, S-IgA) determined by ELISA, has been found. The results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation D, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: review of the current status.
AB  - BACKGROUND: acute mastoiditis is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. Its management is still a challenge due to potentially serious consequences. This study was designed to evaluate the recent experience with pediatric acute mastoiditis at our institution and to determine if the incidence of this entity is changing over time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: retrospective review of records of children with acute mastoiditis treated at the hospital of the Medical School at the University of Porto, Portugal, between July 1993 and June 1998. Criteria for the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis were postauricular swelling and erythema, protrusion of the auricle, and evidence of co-existent or recent otitis media. RESULTS: 43 patients fulfilled the entry criteria. Most were boys (69%). Ages ranged from 8 months to 14 years and 4 months; infants represented 40% of the total. Acute mastoiditis was the first recognized sign of otitis media in 48% of patients. More recent years of the study saw an increase in the number of children referred with acute mastoiditis. Upon admission, 56% were under antibiotic treatment, with an average intake of 5.8 days. All patients were hospitalized; 26 cases recovered after intravenous antibiotics plus myringotomy, and the rest required an additional surgical procedure. The most common organisms recovered from cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In our series, associated complications occurred in 13.9%; facial paralysis in one, and involvement of the central nervous system in five. CONCLUSIONS: pediatric acute mastoiditis continues to be a potentially dangerous infection in the antibiotic era. The incidence of this complication may be increasing recently in the community studied. Great care is required of clinicians to reach an early diagnosis in order to promote adequate management and prevent inherently severe complications.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - A review of antimicrobial resistance in Canada.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. Over the past 10 years, considerable efforts and resources have been expended to detect, monitor, and understand at the basic level the many different facets of emerging and increasing resistance. This review summarizes our current understanding of bacterial antimicrobial resistance issues in Canada with particular emphasis given to the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, future concerns and programs for ongoing surveillance are discussed.
TI  - Predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. Knowledge of their occurrence and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. We performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. OBJECTIVE: To delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. METHODS: Children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. Characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (TBSA), burn 15%]. Twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis, 6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13 involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia, 2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). Twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by CDC criteria no organism was recovered. Organisms causing infection were: Staphylococcus aureus, 19; Candida albicans, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 4; Enterococcus sp., 3; Escherichia coli, 1; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and Candida parapsilosis, 1. Burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (TBSA >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors for infection; young age and site of burn were not. CONCLUSION: The most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. Characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. Children with flame and inhalation injury, TBSA burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin(BAY 12-8039) against respiratory tract pathogens from six Latin-American countries.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin (BAY 12-8039) was evaluated against 636 isolates of respiratory tract pathogens. The isolates were collected from July 1997 to August 1998 in the frame of a multinational Latin American study. E-test strips calibrated to read moxifloxacin MIC ranges from 0.002 to 32 microg/ml were used in susceptibility testing. Weekly quality control tests in each laboratory ensured reproducibility. Laboratories from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay participated. MIC(90) for moxifloxacin were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (304 isolates) 0.25 microg/ml, Haemophilus influenzae (135 isolates) 0.125 microg/ ml, Streptococcus pyogenes (66 isolates) 0.25 microg/ml, Moraxella catarrhalis (62 isolates) 0. 25 microg/ml and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (69 isolates) 0.25 microg/ml. These results agreed with reports from other areas. Moxifloxacin showed excellent activity against respiratory pathogens from participant countries.
TI  - Resistance to multiple fluoroquinolones in a clinical isolate of Streptococcus pyogenes: identification of gyrA and parC and specification of point mutations associated with resistance.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to multiple fluoroquinolones was isolated from the blood of an immunocompromised patient. Resistance to fluoroquinolones in S. pyogenes has not been previously studied. Compared to 10 sensitive strains of S. pyogenes, the fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolate of S. pyogenes presented point mutations in gyrA, predicting that serine-81 was changed to phenylalanine and that methionine-99 was changed to leucine, and in parC, predicting that serine-79 was changed to tyrosine. The mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in this isolate of S. pyogenes appears to be analogous to previously reported mechanisms for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical site infections and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study post surgical infections and sensitivity of the Isolates so that recommendations can be made for their prevention and empirical antibiotic treatment. SETTING: Swabs/pus specimens from the patients developing surgical site infections at PNS Shifa, Karachi were processed in the Department of Pathology during January, 1998 to September, 1999. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine swabs/pus specimens from various types of surgical sites suspected to be infected on clinical grounds were processed, by standard methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing of all the isolates was done by using Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Of the one hundred and fifty-three organisms isolated, the most common was Staphylococcus aureus (50.32%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.3%), Escherichia coli (14.37%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.76%), miscellaneous gram negative rods (5.88%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.30%). About 50% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. In case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli more than 60% of the isolates were found resistant to Gentamicin. The resistance to third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone ciprofloxacin was also quite high. Other isolates also showed a very high level of antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: In addition to the economic burden for antibiotic treatment, such infections for multi-resistant organisms are a serious threat to our surgical patients. To prevent these happenings, there is an urgent need to adopt basic principles of asepsis and sterilisation and to make judicious use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics.
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin compared to those of seven agents against bacteria recovered from outpatients with respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin and levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone and clarithromycin was evaluated against 173 S. pneumoniae strains (128, penicillin-susceptible strains; 32, intermediate penicillin- resistant strains and 13, penicillin-resistant strains), 163 H. influenzae strains (128, beta-lactamase non-producer; 35, beta-lactamase producers), 111 M. catarrhalis (9, beta-lactamase non-producer; 102, beta-lactamase producers), 95 Streptococcus pyogenes and 116 S. aureus strains (96, methicillin-susceptible; 20, methicillin-resistant) recovered from outpatients with respiratory tract infection. Based upon the MICs at which 50% and 90% of the isolates were inhibited we concluded that gatifloxacin proved to be the most active antibiotic against respiratory pathogens, including all the penicillin-resistant pneumococci and H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis producing beta-lactamase. Furthermore, their MICs against S. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were lower than those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.Therefore, this new fluoroquinolone displayed in vitro features that make it suitable for treating community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro comparative dynamics of modified-release clarithromycin and of azithromycin.
AB  - Antibacterial kinetics of modified-release clarithromycin (CLA) and azithromycin  (AZI) against respiratory tract pathogens were compared in relation to their pharmacokinetic profile. The study was carried out in three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, respectively, exposed to concentration gradients of CLA and AZI simulating human serum pharmacokinetics after administration of 500 mg p.o. in a single dose. Bactericidal kinetics were assessed by counting the number of survivors before each change in concentration over a period of 36 h. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CLA and AZI were evaluated at time 0 and after 36 h of exposure to antibiotics in the surviving organisms. The results showed that CLA and AZI, in the experimental conditions adopted, had different antibacterial kinetics. Moreover, the addition of the 14-OH metabolite of CLA at the same concentrations reached in human serum exerted a bactericidal effect against two strains of H. influenzae resistant to CLA and AZI. An increase in MICs was observed against S. pyogenes and H. influenzae, with higher values for AZI.
TI  - Micro-organisms responsible for osteo-articular infections.
AB  - Identification of the aetiological agents responsible for bone and joint infections requires either hard to obtain specimens that are easy to interpret, or easy to obtain specimens of difficult interpretation. Isolates obtained by blood cultures, arthrocentesis, or trephine or surgical biopsy bone samples are usually clinically significant. In contrast, samples obtained from sinus tracts or through open wounds are very often easy to obtain but difficult to interpret. Micro-organisms such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common cause of infections around prosthetic joint materials but are usually of little significance when obtained from the sinus tract of a patient with chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia without osteosynthesis. Other micro-organisms to be interpreted with caution include Corynebacterium spp. and Enterococcus spp. The most important families of antimicrobial agents and their utility in bone and joint infections are briefly reviewed at the end of the chapter. Bone and joint infections require long-term antimicrobial therapy based on the correct diagnosis and the appropriate selection of antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, resistance of Gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. New antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. We conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates of the gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. RESULTS: All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s were 1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S aureus. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. The MIC90s were 1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes and viridans streptococci. Ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. H influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. B catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. CONCLUSIONS: We found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and B catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against H influenzae.
TI  - The Naval Health Research Center Respiratory Disease Laboratory.
AB  - Concern about emerging and reemerging respiratory pathogens prompted the development of a respiratory disease reference laboratory at the Naval Health Research Center. Professionals working in this laboratory have instituted population-based surveillance for pathogens that affect military trainees and responded to threats of increased respiratory disease among high-risk military groups. Capabilities of this laboratory that are unique within the Department of Defense include adenovirus testing by viral shell culture and microneutralization serotyping, influenza culture and hemagglutination inhibition serotyping, and other special testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Projected capabilities of this laboratory include more advanced testing for these pathogens and testing for other emerging pathogens, including Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Such capabilities make the laboratory a valuable resource for military public health.
TI  - [Antibiotic therapy. Strong bacteriocidal effect prevents development of resistant pathogens].
AB  
TI  - In vitro study of the post-antibiotic effect and the bactericidal activity of Cefditoren and ten other oral antimicrobial agents against upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and batericidal activity of cefditoren  was compared to that of cefixime, cefuroxime, loracarbef, cefaclor, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin against ATCC culture strains and clinical respiratory isolates. A PAE > 1 h was observed for cefditoren and generally for the macrolides against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-negative Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas the other beta-lactams showed mixed results. Cefditoren was the only beta-lactam showing significant bactericidal activity (>3 log reduction of viable cells) within 4 h against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Only cefditoren and ciprofloxacin showed significant bactericidal activity against beta-lactamase-negative (after 24 h) and beta-lactamase-positive strains of H. influenzae (after 12 h). Against beta-lactamase-positive strains of M. catarrhalis, cefditoren was the only agent to show significant bactericidal activity at 6 h (versus cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin at 12 h).
TI  - [National multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens. Spanish Study Group on Moxifloxacin].
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Genetic characterization of a Streptococcus mutans LraI family operon and role in virulence.
AB  - Proteins belonging to the LraI (for "lipoprotein receptor antigen") family function as adhesins in several streptococci, as a virulence factor for endocarditis in at least one of these species, and potentially as metal transporters in many bacteria. We have identified and characterized the chromosomal locus containing the LraI family gene (designated sloC) from Streptococcus mutans, an agent of dental caries and endocarditis in humans. Northern blot analysis indicated that sloC is cotranscribed with three other genes. As with other LraI operons, the sloA and sloB genes apparently encode components of an ATP-binding cassette transport system. The product of the fourth gene, sloR, has homology to the metal-dependent regulator from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, DtxR. A potential binding site for SloR was identified upstream from the sloABCR operon and was conserved upstream from LraI operons in several other streptococci. Potential SloR homologs were identified in the unfinished genomic sequences from two of these, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Mutagenesis of sloC in S. mutans resulted in apparent loss of expression of the entire operon as assessed by Northern blot analysis. The sloC mutant was indistinguishable from its wild-type parent in a gnotobiotic rat model of caries but was significantly less virulent in a rat model of endocarditis. Virulence for endocarditis was restored by correction of the sloC mutation but not by provision of the sloC gene in trans, suggesting that virulence requires the expression of other genes in the sloC operon.
TI  - [Phenotypes of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin resistant Streptococcus  viridans isolated from blood].
AB  - Macrolide resistance has been widely studied in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae although not in viridans group streptococci (VGS). We studied 30 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci (25 resistant to erythromycin: 10 S. mitis, 8 S. milleri, 6 S. sanguis and 1 S. salivarius; and 5 susceptible: 2 S. mitis, 2 S. milleri and 1 S. sanguis). We carried out a double-disk test and determined MICs. The susceptibility testing was carried out by agar dilution for 14-, 15- and 16-member lactone ring macrolides, as well as for clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Fifty-six percent of the erithromycin-resistant strains (6 S. mitis, 6 S. milleri and 2 S. sanguis) showed an MLS(B) phenotype, with a high level of intrinsic resistance to all the macrolides studied and clindomycin; 28&#37; were of the M phenotype (4 S. sanguis, 2 S. mitis and 1 S. salivarius). We found a third resistance phenotype, which was present in 4 strains with MICs of 2-8 microg/ml, with resistance to macrolides and different degrees of resistance to clindamycin. All isolates were fully susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The MLS(B) and M phenotypes initially described in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are also observed in VGS.
TI  - [National Multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens]
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Different phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant blood isolates in viridans group  streptococci]
AB  - Macrolide resistance has been widely studied in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae although not in viridans group streptococci (VGS). We studied 30 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci (25 resistant to erythromycin: 10 S. mitis, 8 S. milleri, 6 S. sanguis and 1 S. salivarius; and 5 susceptible: 2 S. mitis, 2 S. milleri and 1 S. sanguis). We carried out a double-disk test and determined MICs. The susceptibility testing was carried out by agar dilution for 14-, 15- and 16-member lactone ring macrolides, as well as for clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Fifty-six percent of the erithromycin-resistant strains (6 S. mitis, 6 S. milleri and 2 S. sanguis) showed an MLS(B) phenotype, with a high level of intrinsic resistance to all the macrolides studied and clindomycin; 28&#37; were of the M phenotype (4 S. sanguis, 2 S. mitis and 1 S. salivarius). We found a third resistance phenotype, which was present in 4 strains with MICs of 2-8 microg/ml, with resistance to macrolides and different degrees of resistance to clindamycin. All isolates were fully susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The MLS(B) and M phenotypes initially described in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are also observed in VGS.
TI  - [Multilocus sequencing--a new method of genotyping bacteria and first results of  its use].
AB  - Comparative characterization (molecular typing) of isolates within a bacterial species is one of the major problems in microbiology and epidemiology. However, it is rather difficult to correlate data obtained in various laboratories, because traditional, including molecular, methods employed in typing pathogenic microorganisms cannot be standardized. In 1998, Maiden et al. proposed multilocus sequence typing (MLST); through which alleles of several housekeeping genes are directly assessed by nucleotide sequencing, each unique allele combination determining a sequence type of a strain. The advantages of this approach are that the culturing of pathogenic microorganisms is avoided, as their gene fragments are amplified directly from biological samples, and that the sequencing data are unambiguous, easy to standardize, and electronically portable. The latter makes it possible to generate an expandable global database for each species at an Internet site, in order to use it for the purposes of genotyping pathogenic bacteria (and other infectious agents). MLST protocols have been elaborated for Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori; those for Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae are now being developed. Basic principles and the first results of MLST have been reviewed, including data on the distribution and microevolution of N. meningitidis clones causing epidemic meningococcal infection, the relative recombination and mutation rates in the N. meningitidis genome, the identification of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae clones causing severe generalized infection, the grouping of H. pylori isolates from various geographic regions, etc.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant streptococci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the new agents linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin were determined and compared with those of penicillin, clindamycin, and four macrolides against 53 erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 117 S. pyogenes (64 erythromycin-susceptible and 53 -resistant), and 101 S. agalactiae (53 erythromycin-susceptible and 48 -resistant) isolates. Differentiation of macrolide resistance phenotypes was performed by the double-disk method. The genetic basis for macrolide resistance in 52 strains was also determined. The M phenotype was found in 84.9, 6.3, and 1.9% of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. These strains were susceptible to miocamycin and clindamycin. Strains with the inducible phenotype accounted for 27.1% of S. agalactiae isolates and 9.4% each of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae isolates. All erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to the 14- and 15-membered macrolides tested. Strains with all three phenotypes were susceptible to </=2 microgram of linezolid per ml. Quinupristin-dalfopristin exhibited good in vitro activity against all strains, irrespective of their resistance to erythromycin (MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.2 to 1 microgram/ml). Against the erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae strains, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were the most active agents (MIC(90)s, 0.1 microgram/ml). The new antimicrobials evaluated may be alternative agents to treat infections caused by macrolide-resistant as well as macrolide-susceptible streptococci.
TI  - The first structure of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase reveals the catalytic residues necessary for the two-fold oxidation.
AB  - Bacterial UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGlcDH) is essential for formation of the  antiphagocytic capsule that protects many virulent bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes andStreptococcus pneumoniae type 3 from the host's immune system. We have determined the X-ray structures of both native and Cys260Ser UDPGlcDH from S. pyogenes (74% similarity to S. pneumoniae) in ternary complexes with UDP-xylose/NAD(+) and UDP-glucuronic acid/NAD(H), respectively. The 402 residue homodimeric UDPGlcDH is composed of an N-terminal NAD(+) dinucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal UDP-sugar binding domain connected by a long (48 A) central alpha-helix. The first 290 residues of UDPGlcDH share structural homology with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, including conservation of an active site lysine and asparagine that are implicated in the enzyme mechanism. Also proposed to participate in the catalytic mechanism are a threonine and a glutamate that hydrogen bond to a conserved active site water molecule suitably positioned for general acid/base catalysis.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of growth of erythromycin A-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive bacteria by the ketolides telithromycin (HMR 3647) and HMR 3004.
AB  - We investigated the in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of the ketolides telithromycin (HMR 3647) and HMR 3004 and analyzed the results using the sigmoid E(max) model. Mean maximum telithromycin PAEs against erythromycin A-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 3. 7, 8.9, and 9.7 h, respectively, while maximum PAEs for erythromycin A-resistant strains were much shorter. Mean maximum HMR 3004 PAEs were 3.2 to 4.4 h for all species.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: an increase in frequency in Northern Virginia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mastoiditis is reported to occur 2 or 3 times annually in the largest children's hospitals. We encountered an average of 1 case annually at our hospital from 1986 to 1991. During an 8-year period ending October 31, 1999, 22 patients were diagnosed and treated at our hospital. Of these, 17 presented during the last 34 months. METHODS: Retrospective chart review from office and hospital records of children from infancy to age 12 years with a discharge diagnosis of acute mastoiditis who were treated from 1992 through 1999. RESULTS: All children were referred to one of the two pediatric otolaryngologists in our community because of forward protrusion of the auricle and retroauricular cellulitis. Eleven (50%) were <14 months old. Ninety-five percent had a concomitant ipsilateral, inflamed, bulging, immobile eardrum. Computerized tomographic imaging, performed on all patients, revealed universal cortical destruction, subperiosteal abscess or bone destruction in four and dural venous thrombosis in two. Mastoidectomy was necessary for eight children (36%) because of complications of mastoiditis (n = 4) or for failure to improve with antibiotics and myringotomy drainage (n = 4). Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from 10 of 17 children (59%) from whom cultures were obtained. CONCLUSION: Cases of acute mastoiditis have markedly increased in our suburban children's hospital. The disease was most common during infancy. Serious complications of mastoiditis occurred in four (18%) of the children in this series.
TI  - The gene encoding IIAB(Man)L in Streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic IIAB protein, called IIAB(Man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. This paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the specific components of the mannose-PTS of Streptococcus salivarius. The man operon was composed of four genes, manL, manM, manN and manO. These genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (Pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mRNA that contained a 5'-UTR (untranslated region). The predicted manL gene product encoded a 35.5 kDa protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the IIA and IIB phosphorylation sites already determined from purified S. salivarius IIAB(Man)L. Expression of manL in Escherichia coli generated a 35 kDa protein that reacted with anti-IIAB(Man)L antibodies. The predicted ManM protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kDa. ManM had similarity with IIC domains of the mannose-EII family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-IIC proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. From multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified IIC(Man) signature is proposed: GX3G[DNH]X3G[LIVM]2XG2[STL][LT][EQ]. The deduced product of manN was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. The ManN protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the IID domains of the mannose-EII family. manO encoded a 13.7 kDa protein. This gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a promoter located in the manN-manO intergenic region. A search of current databases revealed the presence of IIAB(Man)L, ManM, ManN and ManO orthologues in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. This work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose PTS in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (ManO) within the man operon.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced Gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some Gram-positive organisms. We compared the in vitro activity of these compounds against 4151 Gram-negative and -positive organisms. Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. All compounds were highly active (overall) against Gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that the advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The extracellular hyaluronidase gene (hylA) of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Group A streptococci produce an extracellular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate lyase) which may be associated with the spread of the organism during infection. The gene for this hyaluronidase (hylA) encodes an 868 amino acid protein with a molecular size of 99636 Da. Cleavage of the proposed signal peptide results in an extracellular protein of 95941 Da. Comparison with other bacterial hyaluronidases indicates strong similarities to the genes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. A region internal to the hylA gene was amplified from all 175 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested suggesting a widespread distribution of the gene.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of diospyrin, isodiospyrin and bisisodiospyrin from the root of Diospyros piscatoria (Gurke) (Ebenaceae).
AB  - Two dimeric naphthoquinones, diospyrin and isodiospyrin, isolated from the root of Diospyros piscatoria (Gurke), a common ingredient in several folk medicines, have been shown to have a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of diospyrin against Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12344 and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 33400 ranged from 1.56 to 50 microg/mL. While those against Salmonella choleraesuis serotype typhi (S. typhi), ATCC 6539 and Mycobacterium chelonae ATCC 19977 were between 25 and 100 microg/mL. Isodiospyrin was more active than its racemic isomer diospyrin. The MICs against Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 0.78 to 50 microg/mL. While those against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15443 and S. typhi ranged from 50 to 100 microg/mL. The MIC for M. chelonae was between 6.25 and 25 microg/mL. MICs were found to increase with the concentration of cells used for the inoculum. The MICs for Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 increased up to the highest concentration of cells tested. The same phenomenon was observed on M. chelonae, but with better effect in the latter. The kinetics of bacteria studies against both B. subtilis and M. chelonae increases with increasing concentration of isodiospyrin tested. Two tetrameric forms of plumbagin were isolated. The naphthoquinone bisisodiospyrin, gave MIC values between 300 and 400 micro g/mL. The second, as yet unidentified tetramer, was not active at 500 micro g/mL.
TI  - Macrolide resistance and erythromycin resistance determinants among Belgian Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.
AB  - Resistance of streptococci to macrolide antibiotics is caused by target-site modification or drug efflux. The phenotypic expression of target-site modification can be inducible or constitutive. The prevalence of the three phenotypes among Belgian erythromycin-resistant Group A streptococci (GAS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was surveyed, their MICs for seven antibiotics were determined and the clonality of the isolates was explored. Of the 2014 GAS isolates tested 131(6.5%) were erythromycin resistant (MIC > 1 mg/L): 110 (84.0%) showed the M-resistance phenotype whereas the remaining 21 strains (16.0%) were constitutively resistant. No inducibly resistant strains were detected. Of 100 S. pneumoniae isolates, 33 were erythromycin resistant (MIC > 1 mg/L). In contrast to the GAS isolates, only 9.1% of the 33 erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates showed the M-resistance phenotype. The presence of mefA/E and ermB genes in the M-resistant and constitutively and inducibly resistant strains, respectively, was confirmed by PCR analysis. Genomic analysis based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the restriction enzyme SfiI, revealed 54 different PFGE patterns among the 131 erythromycin-resistant GAS isolates, of which an M6 clone represented 16.0% of the strains; all other clones, exhibiting different M-types, represented <7% of the strains. The S. pneumoniae isolates also appeared to be polyclonally based, as determined by arbitrarily primed PCR. The macrolides miocamycin and rovamycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the ketolide HMR 3647 showed excellent activity against the M-resistant GAS and S. pneumoniae strains.
TI  - Interleukin 8 in middle ear fluid during acute otitis media: correlation with aetiology and bacterial eradication.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the concentration of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in the middle ear  fluid of children with acute otitis media and the association between IL-8 concentrations, aetiology of acute otitis media, and bacteriological sterilisation. STUDY DESIGN: Middle ear fluid was obtained by tympanocentesis at enrollment (day 1) and on day 4-5 in 81 children aged 3-36 months with acute otitis media who received antibiotic treatment. IL-8 concentrations were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: 101 samples were obtained on day 1 and 47 samples on day 4-5. 94 pathogens were isolated in 79 of 101 samples obtained on day 1: 56 Haemophilus influenzae, 35 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 Moraxella catarrhalis, and 1 Streptococcus pyogenes. Among 40 paired, initially culture positive samples, sterilisation was achieved on day 4-5 in 22 but not in 18 (13 H influenzae, 2 S pneumoniae, and 3 H influenzae and S pneumoniae concomitantly). IL-8 was detected in 96 of 101 and 46 of 47 samples obtained on days 1 and 4-5, respectively. Mean (SD) IL-8 concentration on day 1 was significantly higher in culture positive than in negative samples (12,636 (23,317) v 5,920 (7,080) pg/ml). In paired samples, IL-8 concentration fell in 12 of 22 ears in which sterilisation was achieved and in 9 of 21 ears with persistent or new infection. Mean (SD) IL-8 concentrations on day 4-5 were significantly higher in culture positive than in negative samples (15,420 (15,418) v 6,695 (5,092) pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Higher IL-8 concentrations are found in culture positive middle ear fluid in acute otitis media. Bacterial eradication is associated with a fall in these concentrations.
TI  - Impact of azithromycin on oropharyngeal carriage of group A Streptococcus and nasopharyngeal carriage of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections are a cause of serious morbidity and high mortality. There is a need for a simple, effective antimicrobial regimen that could be used to prevent invasive GAS disease in high risk situations. To assess azithromycin as a chemoprophylactic agent, we evaluated its efficacy for eradication of oropharyngeal (OP) GAS and its impact on the nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization rate of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: We obtained OP and NP swabs for GAS and pneumococcus culture, respectively, from 300 schoolmates of a child with an invasive GAS infection. GAS culture-positive students were treated with daily azithromycin (12 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. We obtained follow-up OP and NP swabs at 9 (Day 17) and 24 (Day 32) days post-treatment from those students identified as GAS carriers on Day 0 and determined macrolide susceptibility of GAS and pneumococcal isolates. RESULTS: Of the 300 students swabbed 152 (50%) carried GAS in their oropharynx. On Day 17, efficacy of azithromycin for GAS eradication was 95% (140 of 147) for all students. NP colonization rates for pneumococci decreased from 46% (67 of 146) to 12% (17 of 144; P < 0.001) by Day 17 and to 20% (27 of 137; P < 0.001) by Day 32. The prevalence of erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates increased from 2% (3 of 146) to 4% (6 of 144) by Day 17 and to 8% (11 of 137; P = 0.04) by Day 32. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin is an effective short course regimen for eradication of oropharyngeal GAS. However, azithromycin selected for macrolide-resistant strains of pneumococci. These findings highlight the importance of determining the appropriate circumstances for antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent invasive GAS infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Multilocus sequence typing.
AB  - Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) provides a new approach to molecular epidemiology that can identify and track the global spread of virulent or antibiotic-resistant isolates of bacterial pathogens using the Internet. MLST databases, together with interrogation software, are available for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae and databases for Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus will be released shortly.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  - High-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (MIC: 12-25 microM against S. pyogenes). In an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. One such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. This molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial RNA, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. Structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. Although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. Compound 22 was tested for its ability to cure a systemic K. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  - Macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as Legionella, Chlamydia, Campylobacter spp, Branhamella spp, Pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. Emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are found in France and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. RU 004, HMR 3647, and TE 802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. Research at Abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-O-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae. Research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. Another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. Ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. Bacterial resistance ( such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. Many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. The new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. This presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.
TI  - Etiology of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in infants younger than three months of age in Ethiopia.
AB  - METHODS: Within a multicenter study coordinated by WHO, an investigation of the etiologic agents of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis was performed among infants younger than 3 months of age seen at the Ethio-Swedish Children's Hospital in Addis Ababa for a period of 2 years. Of the 816 infants enrolled 405 had clinical indications for investigation. RESULTS: There were a total of 41 isolates from blood cultures from 40 infants. The study showed that the traditionally known acute respiratory infection pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae was most common in this extended neonatal age group, found in 10 of 41 blood isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes was a common pathogen in this setting (9 of 41 blood isolates), whereas Salmonella group B was found in 5 of 41 isolates. Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a common pathogen in developed countries, was absent. A study of the susceptibility pattern of these organisms suggests that a combination of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside is adequate for initial treatment of these serious bacterial infections, but the combination is not optimal for the treatment of Salmonella infections. Among 202 infants on whom immunofluorescent antibody studies for viruses were performed based on nasopharyngeal aspirates, respiratory syncytial virus was found in 57 (28%) infants, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 32 (15.8%) of 203 infants.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in very young Filipino infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections are leading causes  of death in developing countries. As part of a multicenter study we aimed to determine the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections in a cohort of Filipino infants ages 90 days or younger. METHOD: During a 2-year period, 2053 infants age 90 days or younger presenting to 1 of 3 Manila community hospitals were screened; 873 had signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious illness, and 608 were judged to have clinical features suggestive of severe infection and had laboratory workup including blood for culture and white blood cell count, nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology, cerebrospinal fluid culture when indicated and chest radiograph. Chest radiographs were read independently by 3 radiologists without knowledge of clinical findings. RESULTS: Of the 873 enrolled infants, 81 died (91%). After exclusion of presumed contaminants, positive bacterial culture from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in 35 infants (5.8%; 95% confidence interval 4%, 8%), 9 of whom died. The organisms responsible for meningitis were Acinetobacter spp. (4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter spp. (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (1); those responsible for the other clinical diagnoses were Salmonella spp. (6), Enterobacter spp. (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), other Gram-negative organisms (8), S. pneumoniae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (2). In 685 infants examined for viral causes of their illness, 223 viruses were isolated from 219 infants (32%; 95% confidence interval 28%, 36%). Enteroviruses were the most common potential pathogens identified (22% of infants studied), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (17%), rhinovirus (10%) and adenovirus (4%). Concomitant virus identification occurred in 10 of those with positive bacterial culture (29%; 95% confidence interval, 15%, 46%), with enterovirus being found in 7 of these cases. CONCLUSION: Many young Filipino infants with life-threatening illness were evaluated in this study. Thirty-five had infections attributable to bacteria, with Salmonella spp. being the most common, followed by Gram-negative organisms. Pneumococcus was an unusual cause.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of severe infection in children less than three months old in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the bacterial and viral etiology of severe infection in young Papua New Guinean infants as part of a multicenter study in four developing countries aimed at improving case management guidelines. METHODS: Between March, 1991, and April, 1993, children aged <3 months were recruited at the outpatient department of Goroka Base Hospital, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Children with pre-defined inclusion criteria were enrolled, a history was taken and clinical examination was performed. Blood and urine were collected from children with signs suggestive of severe disease together with eye, umbilical and pernasal swabs as appropriate. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children with and without signs of severe disease for identification of viruses and Chlamydia trachomatis by direct fluorescent antibody staining. RESULTS: 3280 infants were triaged and 2168 enrolled, among whom 968 had signs suggestive of severe disease. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus were the most important bacterial pathogens isolated from children < 1 month old with severe infections, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were most important in older children. Of 292 eye swabs 19 (7%) grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Of 116 umbilical swabs 51 (44%) grew S. pyogenes and 45 (39%) grew Staphylococcus aureus. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most important viral cause of acute lower respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are important causes of severe infection in young children in the PNG highlands. It is necessary to improve access to clean water, promote hand-washing in the hospital and at home and investigate further the use of maternal immunization for the prevention of severe disease in young infants.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - V2 regions of 16S ribosomal RNA used as a molecular marker for the species identification of streptococci in peripheral blood and synovial fluid from patients with psoriatic arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of 3 streptococcal species in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection targets bacterial 16S rRNA, which is present in bacteria at high copy numbers. The 3 species-specific primers for group A streptococci (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes), group B streptococci (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were designed from the fragments of highly variable V2 regions of 16S rRNA. Total RNA was prepared from whole peripheral blood and joint fluid obtained from patients with PsA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All positive PCR reactions were then sequenced with a Pharmacia ALF DNA sequencing system. RESULTS: Our data in 19 PsA patients showed that 7 peripheral blood samples were positive for GAS (P = 0.006 versus GAS-positive RA patients [n = 0], by Fisher's exact test), and 2 were also positive for GBS. One synovial fluid sample from a PsA patient was positive for GAS. S pneumoniae was absent from all specimens. Seventeen patients with RA were PCR negative for the 3 streptococcal species. Peripheral blood from a patient with inflammatory bowel disease was positive for GAS. CONCLUSION: The presence of GAS 16S rRNA in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with PsA supports the concept that PsA is a reactive arthritis to certain streptococci.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - [Compliance in antibiotic therapy of respiratory tract infections].
AB  
TI  - Is there an ecological relationship between rates of antibiotic resistance of species of the genus Streptococcus? The Spanish Surveillance Group for Respiratory Pathogens.
AB  - The relationship between resistance to antibiotics on the part of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was studied by comparing different prevalences of resistance among hospitals obtained from a recent microbiological surveillance of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. A high correlation for erythromycin resistance was found between S. pneumoniae isolates from lower respiratory tract infections and S. pyogenes isolates collected from pharyngeal swabs.
TI  - Influence of increased macrolide consumption on macrolide resistance of common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The impact of increased macrolide consumption on the resistance of common respiratory pathogens to erythromycin and azithromycin was evaluated. The study focused mainly on azithromycin. During the period from 1991 to 1996, a 3.5-fold increase in macrolide prescriptions for outpatients was observed in Slovenia. Compared to 1994, when no macrolide resistance was evident in Streptococcus pyogenes and noninvasive Streptococcus pneumoniae, a significant increase in macrolide resistance was observed in these two pathogens in 1997. Moraxella catarrhalis remained uniformly susceptible to macrolides. Close monitoring of macrolide resistance of common respiratory pathogens is thus necessary.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefetamet against clinically isolated strains from community acquired respiratory tract infections. Part III].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (CEMT) against clinically isolated strains  from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections were investigated in comparison with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics during the period from January to March, 1998. The results are summarized as follows; 1. CEMT showed strong antimicrobial activities against three major pathogens causing community acquired respiratory tract infections, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. However, antimicrobial activities of CEMT against penicillins (PCs)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCs-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were slightly weaker than those of some of the reference antibiotics. 2. No chronological changes of CEMT-MIC level were observed in the antimicrobial activities against S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis or Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. In contrast to this, due to the increase of PISP and PRSP strains, resistance to CEMT appears increasing with time.
TI  - [Septic polyarthritis: treatment complications and results].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rare polyarticular clinical presentation of peripheric septic arthritis has worst prognosis than monoarticular one. We studied 10 patients with polyarticular septic arthritis treated during the last 8 years, to evaluate functional result and complications after surgical treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 5 men and 5 women, with an average age of 46.5 years (range 18-75 years), they presented septic arthritis in two or more joints. We discuss aetiology, clinical presentation and treatment. RESULTS: Treatment was surgical debridement and parenteral antibiotic therapy. Functional result was poor in 54% of the joints treated, 50% of patients presented septic shock and three died.
TI  - Correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and development of resistance in bacteria.
AB  - The correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and the emergence of resistance in bacteria is complex and has proved difficult to establish. Besides antimicrobial use, many other distinct contributing factors are also involved in the issue. Despite this complexity, there is a substantial body of evidence that the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis and in therapy is associated with the development of resistance in the hospital and in the community. Some examples are reviewed, including increase of resistance in enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase Negative Staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes after the use of beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Success in reversing the rise of resistant strains has been rarely described. Two examples are highlighted, the reduction in the incidence of nasal carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in Icelandic children, and a significant decline in erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes after the reduction in the use of macrolides in Finland.

TI  - Streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  - Streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. We report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). The patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. Nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. Causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; Streptococcus agalactiae, 3; Streptococcus bovis, 2; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 1. Four Streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (MIC, 0.5-2 microg/mL). Five patients (17%) died. The infection is increasing in the hospital setting. Streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. In cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the Streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobials used for therapy of otitis media and sinusitis: effect of previous antimicrobial therapy and smoking.
AB  - We undertook to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens isolated from patients with otitis media or maxillary sinusitis who failed to respond to antimicrobial therapy, and correlate it with previous antimicrobial therapy and smoking. We analyzed isolates recovered from 2 consecutive cultures obtained from middle ear aspirate obtained through an open perforation in 22 children with otitis, and maxillary sinus aspirate collected by endoscopy from 20 patients. Forty-seven isolates were repeatedly recovered from 42 culture-positive individuals. The organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (14), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Moraxella catarrhalis (6), and Streptococcus pyogenes (5). Resistance of at least 2 tube dilutions to the antimicrobial agents used was found in 23 of the 47 (49%) isolates that were found in 20 (48%) of the patients. These included 10 of 15 (67%) isolates of S pneumoniae, 4 of 14 (29%) H influenzae (all were beta-lactamase producers), 4 of 7 (57%) S aureus (all beta-lactamase producers), 5 of 6 (83%) M catarrhalis (all beta-lactamase producers), and none of 5 S pyogenes. In the 21 patients who failed to respond to amoxicillin, H influenzae and S pneumoniae predominated. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 4 of the 11 (36%) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 4 of 21 (19%) after amoxicillin, 2 of 3 (67%) after azithromycin dihydrate, and 1 of 4 (25%) after cefixime. A statistically significant higher recovery of resistant organisms was noted in those treated 2 to 6 months previously, and in those with sinusitis who smoked. The data illustrate the relationship between resistance to antimicrobials and failure of patients with otitis media and sinusitis to improve.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of LJC 11,036, an active metabolite of L-084, a new oral carbapenem antibiotic with potent antipneumococcal activity.
AB  - LJC 11,036 is the active metabolite of L-084, a novel oral carbapenem that exhibits potent broad-spectrum activity. Antibacterial activities of LJC 11,036 against clinical isolates from respiratory infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 52), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 19), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 50), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 53), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 53), and from urinary-tract infections, such as Escherichia coli (n = 53) (MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.1, </=0.006, 0.39, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively), were 2- to 64-fold higher than those of imipenem, cefdinir, and faropenem. Moreover, against these bacterial species, except for H. influenzae, the MIC(90)s of LJC 11,036 were 4- to 512-fold lower than those of levofloxacin. LJC 11,036 showed bactericidal activity equal or superior to that of imipenem. Bactericidal activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) did not vary with the phase of growth. LJC 11,036 had potent activity against various beta-lactamase-producing strains, excluding carbapenemase producers. Against renal dehydropeptidase-I, LJC 11,036 was more stable than imipenem. Furthermore, LJC 11,036 produced in vitro postantibiotic sub-MIC effects against PRSP HSC-3 (6.0 h at one-fourth the MIC) and H. influenzae LJ5 (9.2 h at one-half the MIC). LJC 11,036 showed high binding affinities for PBP1A, -1B, -2A/2X, -2B, and -3 of PRSP and for PBP1B, -2, -3A, and -3B of H. influenzae.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - After 30 years of therapeutic use, thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate (CAS  20192-91-0) is still widely employed in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. This is due to its particular characteristic to exert at pulmonary level, either the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol (CAS 15318-45-3) and the mucolytic activity of N-acetylcysteine (CAS 616-91-1). The aim of this study was to evaluate the present pattern of susceptibility of several clinical isolates to thiamphenicol and the interference of N-acetylcysteine on this parameter. The studies have been performed in vitro. Equimolar concentrations of N-acetylcysteine and even higher concentrations did not interfere with the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. The spectrum of activity of thiamphenicol was similar to that observed in the past and was superior to that of erythromycin and amoxicillin. The activity of thiamphenicol was greater than that of erythromycin against H. influenzae and streptococci and equivalent versus Branhamella catarrhalis. In comparison with amoxicillin the activity of thiamphenicol was higher against H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis and slightly lower against streptococci. The results demonstrate that thiamphenicol maintains its therapeutic value confirming the importance of thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of and pathogen responses to sparfloxacin with those of other agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of and pathogen responses to sparfloxacin were compared with those of standard therapies for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated skin or skin-structure infections, urinary tract infections, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute maxillary sinusitis in 7 multicenter controlled trials in North America. Sparfloxacin was administered orally as a 400-mg loading dose followed by 200 mg once daily for up to 10 days. The bacteriologic efficacy of sparfloxacin (84% to 95%) was comparable to that of comparator drugs (77% to 100%). Sparfloxacin was generally 2 to 8 times more active (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains tested [MIC90]: 0.03 to 0.5 microg/mL) than comparators against common pathogens isolated in community-acquired infections, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains; Moraxella catarrhalis; Haemophilus influenzae; Streptococcus pyogenes; and Staphylococcus aureus. Sparfloxacin was also effective against Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species. The emergence of resistance was uncommon during sparfloxacin therapy (0.3% of 1100 cases). Higher area under the plasma concentration-time curve/MIC and maximum plasma concentration/MIC ratios for sparfloxacin were associated with clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, whereas lower ratios were associated with clinical and bacteriologic failure. The clinical efficacy of sparfloxacin (80% to 95%) was comparable to that obtained with the comparator drugs (71% to 92%). In addition, sparfloxacin was well tolerated and had an overall frequency of related adverse events similar to that of the comparators. There was a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions but a lower level of digestive adverse events with sparfloxacin compared with comparators. Sparfloxacin is a suitable therapeutic alternative for the empiric treatment of respiratory tract infections owing to its favorable pharmacokinetic profile and activity against typical and atypical respiratory tract pathogens, even in geographic areas with a high incidence of penicillin resistance.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of moxifloxacin and post-antibiotic effect.
AB  - The time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of moxifloxacin were studied for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moxifloxacin had a bactericidal effect against all strains tested, with the least rapid bactericidal effect being against S. pyogenes and the most rapid effect against S. aureus and E. coli. The PAE of moxifloxacin was similar to that of other fluoroquinolones and increased with increasing concentration. No association was found between the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin and the duration of PAE. Gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also exposed to concentrations of moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin that simulated the drug concentrations obtained in human serum after standard oral dosing schedules. Simulation of moxifloxacin concentrations in human serum reduced viable counts more effectively and more rapidly than shown in time-kill experiments; in contrast, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin were less effective than when constant concentrations of these antibacterials were used.
TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis in monozygotic twins: studies on immunological parameters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: 11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with AS, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. The peripheral T cell receptor Vbeta repertoire was investigated using FACS analysis and 14 different Vbeta antibodies. In addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma ELISPOT assays. RESULTS: Twins suffering from AS showed cellular hyporeactivity against K pneumoniae, S pyogenes, C albicans in the ELISPOT assays compared with healthy twins. In contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, AS concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their Vbeta repertoire on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective T cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. There are probably other environmental factors that influence disease concordance.
TI  - Dynamics of interleukin-1 production in middle ear fluid during acute otitis media treated with antibiotics.
AB  - In an ongoing prospective study, IL-1 concentrations were measured in 78 children (aged 3-36 months) with acute otitis media receiving antibiotics. Middle ear fluid IL-1 concentrations were determined using ELISA kits. Ninety-eight middle ear fluid samples were obtained by tympanocentesis at enrollment (day 1) and 43 samples were collected on days 4-5. Ninety-two pathogens were isolated in 77/98 samples obtained on day 1: 55 Haemophilus influenzae, 34 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 Moraxella catarrhalis and 1 Streptococcus pyogenes. Among 37 paired samples initially culture-positive, eradication of the pathogen was achieved on day 4-5 in 20 while pathogens were still present in 17. On day 1, IL-1 was detected in 61/77 (79%) culture-positive samples vs 9/21 (43%) culture-negative ones (P = 0.003). The mean +/- SD middle ear fluid concentration of IL-1 on day 1 was significantly higher in culture-positive (316 +/- 508 pg/ml) than in culture-negative samples (111 +/- 245 pg/ml) (P = 0.01). When paired samples were evaluated, IL-1 decreased on days 4-5 in 13/20 (65%) ears where bacterial eradication was achieved, but also in 11/19 (58%) with persistent or new infection. The mean IL-1 concentrations decreased on days 4-5 in the 20 samples from ears where bacterial eradication was achieved (330 +/- 460 vs 118 +/- 294 pg/ml, P = 0.1) but also in the 17 samples where it was not (465 +/- 660 vs 232 +/- 289 pg/ml, P = 0.02). No significant differences were found between day 1 and days 4-5 in the mean IL-1 concentrations measured in patients with H. influenzae vs S. pneumoniae or concomitant H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. It was concluded that: 1) IL-1 was detected in the middle ear fluid of most patients with acute otitis media; 2) significantly higher IL-1 concentrations were found in patients with culture-positive than in those with culture-negative acute otits media; 3) IL-1 concentrations decreased on days 4-5 of antibiotic therapy, whether the pathogen was eradicated or not.
TI  - In vitro activities of macrolides against gram-positive aerobes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Bacteroides fragilis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New macrolides with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics have been developed and introduced for clinical use in Taiwan. In order to understand the antibacterial activities of these new macrolides, we tested their in vitro activities against common pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin for clinical isolates collected from six teaching hospitals in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Bacteroides fragilis. RESULTS: High MICs were detected against most of the bacteria tested except for H influenzae and M catarrhalis. The MIC90 for viridans streptococci, S pneumoniae, S pyogenes, Enterococcus spp, S aureus (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), Coryne-bacterium spp, and B fragilis were all at least 128 micrograms/ml. Wide ranges of MICs were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria tested were highly resistant to macrolides. This result is a warning for clinicians that rational use of antibiotics, including macrolides, is mandatory.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of linezolid by two standard methods.
AB  - To determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, MICs and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy for 198 strains of gram-positive cocci. Zones were 4-5 mm larger by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method, but MICs did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method was used. This is because incubation in CO2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. Breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx of healthy  children.
AB  - In a study to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx of healthy children, throat swabs obtained from 1765 children were cultured and the organisms recovered tested by the disk diffusion method and the E test. Six hundred ninety-one children (39.1%) harbored Haemophilus influenzae, 112 (6.3%) Streptococcus pyogenes, 73 (4.1%) Moraxella catarrhalis, 52 (2.9%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 50 (2.8%) Neisseria meningitidis in their oropharynx. The rate of penicillin resistance was 2%, 0%, and 12%, respectively, for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Neisseria meningitidis. Ampicillin resistance was observed in 8.6% of Haemophilus influenzae strains and 78% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains and was associated with the presence of beta-lactamase, except in one strain of Haemophilus influenzae. Five (4.4%) isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to macrolides. The low level of resistance observed in this area contrasts with the high rates reported in the literature.
TI  - Respiratory diseases among U.S. military personnel: countering emerging threats.
AB  - Emerging respiratory disease agents, increased antibiotic resistance, and the loss of effective vaccines threaten to increase the incidence of respiratory disease in military personnel. We examine six respiratory pathogens (adenoviruses, influenza viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis) and review the impact of the diseases they cause, past efforts to control these diseases in U.S. military personnel, as well as current treatment and surveillance strategies, limitations in diagnostic testing, and vaccine needs.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological study of an otitis media outbreak in calves in a dairy herd.
AB  - On a dairy farm, otitis media was diagnosed in 64 suckler calves (21.8%) during a study period of 2 years, and in 10 calves (3.4%) in the third year. The inflammation was unilateral in 63 and bilateral in 11 calves. The affected calves were dull, lacked appetite, were pyrexic and displayed drooping ear or ears and tilted heads with purulent discharge exuding from the external ear canal. Of the affected animals, 56 (87.5%) were aged between 3 and 8 weeks. Morbidity was higher during the calving season and during the autumn and winter months (October-December). Pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from 21 (32.8%), P. multocida from 20 (31.2%), Actinomyces pyogenes from 11 (17.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae from three (4.7%) of the clinically affected calves only during the first two study years. The exudate of the acute ear infections contained, in addition to Pasteurella spp., various bacteria and yeasts. Most of these bacteria were isolated from healthy ears as well, and are likely to be part of the normal ear flora. On the other hand most of the yeasts were isolated from otitic calves. After a short course of an appropriate treatment infections healed in all cases. Possible preventive measures are discussed.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect and postantibiotic sub-mic effect of dirithromycin and erythromycin against respiratory tract pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of dirithromycin and erythromycin against strains Streptococcus pyogenes group A M12, NCTC P1800, Streptococcus pneumoniae 23, Staphylococcus aureus Oxford strain 209, Moraxella catarrhalis 15616 and Haemophilus influenzae 5590 was investigated in vitro and in vivo by use of the tissue cage model in rabbits. By exposing strains to 2.5-5 x MIC levels for 6 h or 12 h, both compounds induced in vitro PAEs of 1-9 h, and in two cases >20 h. Cultures in the PAE-phase were then re-exposed to subinhibitory concentrations (0.25 x MIC and 0.5 x MIC) of antibiotic and prolonged suppression of regrowth was obtained for 2->20 h. Following i.v. antibiotic treatment of rabbits (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg dirithromycin and 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg erythromycin) and bacterial infection of the implanted tissue cages in the same rabbit, the tissue cage fluid (TCF) was sampled 6 h after infection and regrowth was monitored by sampling from new tissue cages in untreated rabbits. These i.v. single doses of both antibiotics induced in vivo PAEs of >6 h, but <20 h against S. pyogenes. Suppression of regrowth in TCF was also obtained for > or = 20 h on infection with exposed S. pyogenes in the PAE-phase in newly implanted tissue cages in rabbits that had been treated with low doses of antibiotic to produce subinhibitory concentrations in the TCE Dirithromycin was in general as active as erythromycin in inducing PAE and in prolonging suppression of bacterial regrowth in the PAE phase.
TI  - The role of newer macrolides in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection. A review of experimental and clinical data.
AB  - The macrolide class of antibiotics is well established and often recommended for  use in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection (RTI). The newer agents clarithromycin and azithromycin are frequently prescribed as first- or second-line therapy, and have been considered as superior to erythromycin in microbiological activity and clinical efficacy. In-vitro data show that clarithromycin and azithromycin have good activity (MIC < or = 0.5 microg/ml) against certain RTI pathogens. However the activity of both compounds is intrinsically low against Haemophilus influenzae whilst several other important RTI pathogens - notably Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes - exhibit a high prevalence of resistance to them. In many countries, the prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin and azithromycin is still rising with cross resistance with erythromycin. Maximum serum concentrations of clarithromycin and azithromycin are lower than the MIC90s for these agents against H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Concentrations in tissues have been reported to be much higher than those in serum. However, the high concentrations observed in tissues are largely a reflection of high concentrations inside cells. Concentrations of clarithromycin and azithromycin in extracellular tissue fluids, where Haemophilus and streptococci are located, are in equilibrium with concentrations in the serum, and remain low. It has been suggested that phagocytes deliver azithromycin to infection sites in a targeted fashion, but the evidence in support of this hypothesis is weak. Recent clinical experience with clarithromycin and azithromycin is consistent with preclinical results, and suggests that these agents have limited efficacy against certain respiratory infections. Clarithromycin and azithromycin are the first choice treatment of atypical infections caused by intracellular pathogens. For community-acquired RTIs, where H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae are present, they may no longer be an appropriate choice for first-line therapy. Indeed, in areas where levels of drug resistant S. pneumoniae are high, their use may be questionable as second-line therapy.
TI  - ClpE, a novel type of HSP100 ATPase, is part of the CtsR heat shock regulon of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Clp ATPases, which include the ubiquitous HSP100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. During the course of the Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new member of the HSP100 family. We designated this protein ClpE, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the Clp ATPases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sakei and Clostridium acetobutylicum. A unique feature of these Hsp100-type Clp ATPases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. Unlike the other class III genes of B. subtilis (clpC and clpP ), clpE does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. Transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaA-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. Investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpE expression indicates that this gene is controlled by CtsR and is thus a member of the class III heat shock genes of B. subtilis. CtsR negatively regulates clpE expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five CtsR binding sites were identified through DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis.
TI  - New N-substituted 7-aminocephalosporanic acid derivatives as potential agents against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Synthesis and in vitro activity.
AB  - The synthesis and the antimicrobial properties of a new series of cephalosporinic beta-lactam antibiotics is described. The data reported in the present paper show the potential of this type of substituted cephalosporins as new anti Gram-positive antibiotic drugs. In fact, all compounds tested showed a good in vitro antibacterial activity against the most relevant Gram-positive pathogens including resistant species that currently represent unmet medical need. On the contrary, the new synthesized compounds were found to be completely devoid of any activity on Gram-negative bacteria up to a concentration of the single agent of 128 microg/ml.
TI  - [Streptococcal gangrene and so-called "flesh-eating bacteria disease". A rare and devastating disease].
AB  - Streptococcal gangrene, an unusual form of necrotizing fasciitis with fatal outcome, has been recently rediscovered and has gained popularity with the name "disease of flesh eating bacteria". The incidence of this and other severe diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae has been suggested to be increasing. Only three patients with this disease have been studied at our institution in the last 12 years and in a review of a bacteremic infections caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci a significant increase of these infections was not observed. We report here the clinical and pathological characteristics of streptococcal gangrene as well as a review of the more recent literature.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against clinical isolates of common gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common Gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of E. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. The MIC50 and MIC90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for both MRSA and MSSA; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for MRSE; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for MSSE; 0.125 microgram/mL and 0.125 microgram/mL for S. pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for S. pneumoniae. Eighty-two percent of the tested E. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an MIC50 of 2 micrograms/mL and an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/mL. Quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common Gram-positive bacteria other than E. faecalis in Taiwan.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - Surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria and mechanisms of their targeting to the cell wall envelope.
AB  - The cell wall envelope of gram-positive bacteria is a macromolecular, exoskeletal organelle that is assembled and turned over at designated sites. The cell wall also functions as a surface organelle that allows gram-positive pathogens to interact with their environment, in particular the tissues of the infected host. All of these functions require that surface proteins and enzymes be properly targeted to the cell wall envelope. Two basic mechanisms, cell wall sorting and targeting, have been identified. Cell well sorting is the covalent attachment of surface proteins to the peptidoglycan via a C-terminal sorting signal that contains a consensus LPXTG sequence. More than 100 proteins that possess cell wall-sorting signals, including the M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A of Staphylococcus aureus, and several internalins of Listeria monocytogenes, have been identified. Cell wall targeting involves the noncovalent attachment of proteins to the cell surface via specialized binding domains. Several of these wall-binding domains appear to interact with secondary wall polymers that are associated with the peptidoglycan, for example teichoic acids and polysaccharides. Proteins that are targeted to the cell surface include muralytic enzymes such as autolysins, lysostaphin, and phage lytic enzymes. Other examples for targeted proteins are the surface S-layer proteins of bacilli and clostridia, as well as virulence factors required for the pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes (internalin B) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PspA) infections. In this review we describe the mechanisms for both sorting and targeting of proteins to the envelope of gram-positive bacteria and review the functions of known surface proteins.
TI  - Increased activity of 16-membered lactone ring macrolides against erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae: characterization of South African isolates.
AB  - The susceptibility of 40 erythromycin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and 40 multiply-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to six macrolide antibiotics, representing 14-, 15- and 16-membered lactone ring structures, was tested. The genetic basis for macrolide resistance in the strains was also determined. Both erm and mef determinants were encountered in the 36 S. pneumoniae isolates tested, but only mef in the five S. pyogenes isolates tested. All isolates showed cross-resistance among the 14-membered macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin and the 15-membered macrolide, azithromycin. However, the erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes isolates retained full susceptibility to spiramycin and josamycin (16-membered agents). These latter two antibiotics were also more active than the other macrolides against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates, especially josamycin which was 8-64 times more active than erythromycin; spiramycin was only two to eight times more active than erythromycin.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

AB  
TI  - A prospective study of bacterial meningitis in children from north-eastern Libya.
AB  - During a 14-month period, 77 children (excluding neonates) with bacterial meningitis were studied. The causative organisms were identified in 60 children: Haemophilus influenzae in 26 (34%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in 20 (26%), Gram-negative enteric bacilli in nine (12%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci group A in one. No organism was identified in 17 (22%) cases. The male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The age group most affected was between 2 and 12 months. The case mortality rate was 13% and nine children (12%) were left with permanent neurological sequelae.

TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - Bacteriologic efficacy of a three-day intramuscular ceftriaxone regimen in nonresponsive acute otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacteriologic efficacy of ceftriaxone in nonresponsive acute otitis media in children. METHODS: In a prospective study 92 patients ages 3 to 36 months (median, 11 months) with culture-proved nonresponsive acute otitis media were studied from January, 1995, through August, 1997. The patients were treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/l/day) for 3 days. Middle ear fluid was aspirated for culture by tympanocentesis on day of enrollment (Day 1); a second tap was performed on Days 4 to 10. Additional middle ear fluid cultures were obtained if clinical relapse occurred. Bacteriologic failure was defined by positive culture on Days 4 to 10. Patients were followed until Day 17+/-2. Susceptibility was measured by E test. RESULTS: The main drugs administered before enrollment were amoxicillin (38%), amoxicillinclavulanate (25%) and cefaclor (20%). Organisms recovered (n=105) were: Haemophilus influenzae, 54; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 47; Moraxella catarrhalis, 2; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 2. Thirty-four (72%) of the 47 S. pneumoniae isolates were intermediately resistant to penicillin (MIC 0.1 to 1.0 microg/ml), but all were susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC < 0.5 microg/ml). Bacteriologic eradication was achieved in 100 of 105 (95%) cases: 54 of 54 (10O%) H. influenzae, 43 of 47 (92%) S. pneumoniae, 1 of 2 (50%) M. catarrhalis and 2 of 2 (100%) S. pyogenes. Bacteriologic success (with no relapse) occurred in 13 of 13 (100%) penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae vs. 28 of 34 (82%) S. pneumoniae intermediately resistant to penicillin (4 cases of bacteriologic failure and 2 cases of relapse). CONCLUSION: A 3-day intramuscular ceftriaxone regimen is efficacious for the treatment of nonresponsive acute otitis media. The optimal duration of treatment in cases of nonresponsive acute otitis media and whether ceftriaxone is efficacious for the treatment of nonresponsive otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae highly resistant to penicillin is yet to be determined.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of persistent otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the pathogens isolated from children with acute otitis media who did not respond to antimicrobial drug therapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cultures obtained by tympanocentesis from 46 children. RESULTS: Organisms were recovered from 34 children (74%), and 43 isolates were recovered from these individuals. The organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (12 isolates), Moraxella catarrhalis (5 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (5 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (2 isolates). Resistance to the antimicrobial agent used was found in 27 (63%) of 43 isolates found in 22 patients (48%). Of patients who did not respond to amoxicillin therapy, H influenzae predominated. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 5 (56%) of 9 of those who did not respond to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy, 4 (44%) of 9 patients after azithromycin therapy, 3 (25%) of 12 patients after amoxicillin therapy, and 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy and from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data illustrate the relation between resistance to antimicrobial drug therapy and failure of patients with otitis media to improve. They also highlight the importance of diagnostic tympanocentesis in establishing the presence of resistant microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in pharyngitis and tonsillitis].
AB  - The aim of the study was a microbiological analysis of pharyngeal swabs obtained  from 158 patients with the diagnosis of pharyngitis and purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. Beta haemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C and G were isolated from 30% of the patients. The most frequently isolated were Streptococcus pyogenes--12% of patients and Streptococcus group C--10.7%. Other streptococci were isolated less frequently: Streptococcus group B--44%, group G--2.5%. The majority of isolated bacteria belonged to potential pathogenic flora (70% patients). Staphylococcus aureus (37%) and Haemophilus spp. (36%) were isolated most frequently. Other bacteria were isolated in the following sequence: Moraxella catarrhalis--22%, Streptococcus pneumoniae--17% and Gram-negative rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family--6%. One case of Plaut-Vincent tonsillitis was diagnosed. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. The isolated anaerobic bacteria belonged to genus of Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella.
TI  - Unconventional organization of the division and cell wall gene cluster of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The genes responsible for cell wall biosynthesis and cell division (dcw genes) were identified and sequenced in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The genetic organization of the dcw cluster in Streptococcus pneumoniae differed significantly from the clusters of other bacteria reported to date. In particular, the genes corresponding to the 2 min region of the Escherichia coli chromosome were found distributed in three genetically separate regions of the Streptococcus pneumoniae chromosome. The first region contained the expected ftsA and ftsZ cell division genes at one end and pbp2b, ddl and murF at the other end. The murD, murG and divIB genes, always found located upstream of ftsA, were found in a second region separated from the first. A third region contained the yllC, yllD, pbp2x and mraY genes. The chromosomal region downstream of ftsZ was also sequenced and characterized. In Streptococcus pneumoniae this region contains four ORFs, all of unknown function, and an ORF encoding the Bacillus subtilis DivIVA homologue. The gene order and the organization of this region was found to be conserved in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis, raising the possibility that previously unidentified loci may also be involved in division.
TI  - Characterization of the galU gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae encoding a uridine  diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase: a gene essential for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - The galU gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae has been cloned and sequenced. Escherichia coli cells harboring the recombinant plasmid pMMG2 (galU) overproduced a protein that has been shown to correspond to a uridine 5'-triphosphate:glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (uridine diphosphoglucose [UDP-Glc] pyrophosphorylase) responsible for the synthesis of UDP-Glc, a key compound in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides. A gene very similar to the S. pneumoniae galU has been found in a partial nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus pyogenes genome. Knockout galU mutants of type 1 pneumococci are unable to synthesize a detectable capsule. An identical result was found in type 3 S. pneumoniae cells in spite of the fact that these bacteria contain a type-specific gene (cap3C) that also encodes a UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase. Since eukaryotic UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylases appear to be completely unrelated to their prokaryotic counterparts, we postulate that GalU may be an appropriate target for the search of new drugs to control the pathogenicity of bacteria like pneumococcus and S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Phenotypic characterization of erythromycin resistance in strains of the genus Streptococcus isolated from clinical specimens].
AB  - There are presently two recognized mechanisms of resistance to macrolide antibiotics in species of the genus Streptococcus: target modification and efflux. Target modification occurs in the ribosomes through the production of a ribosomal methylase codified for the erm genes and it is phenotypically known as MLSB resistance. Expression of MLSB resistance can be inducible or constitutive. Active efflux has been recently described in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its expression is known as M phenotype. We studied the susceptibility, by determining the MIC using agar dilution, to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin, of 295 strains of the genus Streptococcus clinically isolated from 1993 to 1996 (70 S. pyogenes, 81 S. pneumoniae, 37 viridans group, and 107 S. milleri). We also studied the phenotype pattern of erythromycin-clindamycin resistance in the strains resistant to erythromycin by using the double-disc test. We found a 17.2% resistance to erythromycin and a 12.5% resistance to clindamycin. The M phenotype, initially described in S. pyogenes, was also observed in 6.6% of our S. pneumoniae strains, 25% of S. viridans spp., and 4.8% in the S. milleri group.
TI  - [In vitro activity of trovafloxacin in 238 respiratory pathogens].
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 238 clinical isolates obtained from respiratory specimens were compared with ciprofloxacin. Fifty-four Haemophilus influenzae, 58 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 40 Moraxella catarrhalis, 21 Streptococcus pyogenes, 25 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 40 Staphylococcus aureus (21 methicillin resistant and 19 methicillin susceptible) were studied. The MIC was determined following NCCLS recommendations. Ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin MIC90 was 0.016 mg/l and 0.016 mg/l for H. influenzae, 4 mg/l and 0. 25 mg/l for S. pneumoniae, </=0.008 mg/l and </=0.008 mg/l for M. catarrhalis, 0.5 mg/l and 0.064 mg/l for S. pyogenes, 0.064 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l for K. pneumoniae, 16 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 2 mg/l and 0.032 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. According to this data, trovafloxacin showed better in vitro activity than ciprofloxacin in the Gram-positive pathogen studied and similar activity against the Gram-negatives tested.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Severe left ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias as complications of gram-positive sepsis: rapid recovery in children.
AB  - Severe left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction in children may be associated  with poor outcome in as many as 45% of cases. The prognosis for children with poor left ventricular function or arrhythmias associated with septic shock may be better, however, this has been inadequately studied. We report the favorable outcome of three children who presented with Gram-positive sepsis and significant cardiovascular compromise-two with severely dilated, poorly contractile left ventricle, and one with mild left ventricular dysfunction and incessant, malignant, and rapid atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Our experience with these patients shows that complete and rapid resolution of these complications may be achieved with aggressive therapy.
TI  - Emerging and resurgent pathogens in New York City.

TI  - Bacteriological activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The use of established fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, as  empirical therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe respiratory tract infections is limited by their poor activity against gram-positive and atypical pathogens. Data from in vitro susceptibility studies and in vivo animal protection models suggest that the new fluoroquinolone, trovafloxacin, compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin offers equivalent activity against gram-negative pathogens and improved activity against gram-positive pathogens. In particular, susceptibility data indicate that trovafloxacin is at least 16-fold more potent than either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other susceptible pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. In vivo studies involving models of protection against acute systemic infection and pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, and Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, indicate that the antibacterial spectrum observed for trovafloxacin in vitro extends to the in vivo setting. Together, these findings suggest that trovafloxacin may offer clinical efficacy against respiratory pathogens superior to that of ciprofloxacin and of ofloxacin, and may find a useful role as empiric therapy in both the community and hospital setting.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in pediatric field].
AB  - A drug susceptibility test of the combination drug TAZ/PIPC, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (PIPC), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. The clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. The results were as follows: 1. In susceptibility test, 114 strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, penicillin G (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ). Of three clinically isolated species from patients, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was treated with TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, methicillin (DMPPC), CTM, CTX, and SBT/CPZ, and the others were treated with the same drugs except for DMPPC. The MICs were measured for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC90 values of TAZ/PIPC against 45 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of Gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC for 28 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC. The MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 31 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Regarding Gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 2 strains of S. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTM, and CTX, and the latter was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Of 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of PIPC, SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of H. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were similar to those of PIPC and SBT/CPZ. While the MIC of TAZ/PIPC against the high beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of SBT/CPZ and smaller than that of PIPC. 2. The results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: TAZ/PIPC was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). No case with no response was seen in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. Bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of them were eradicated. 4. Adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of 33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. Of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Biochemical profile showed an increase in GPT alone and abnormal increases in both GOT and GPT in 1 each out of 21 cases.
TI  - Microbiology of bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  - The upper respiratory tract may become susceptible to bacterial infection as a result of health conditions such as allergies and viral infections, as well as the effects of smoking and airborne environmental pollutants. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial pathogens in upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Streptococcus pyogenes is the predominant bacterial pathogen in pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Bacterial pathogens adhere to mucous membranes and colonization ensues. In an otherwise healthy individual the host immune system responds to the invading bacteria resulting in edema and swelling. If antimicrobial treatment does not eradicate the invading organisms and successfully interrupt the progress of the infection, the patient may develop recurrent or chronic disease. S. pneumoniae and other pathogens once susceptible to penicillin and other antibiotics are now becoming resistant. Bacterial resistance has developed and disseminated because of the widespread use of antibiotics. Major mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in upper respiratory tract infections include enzymatic inhibition, membrane impermeability, alteration of target enzymes, active pumping out of antibiotic and alteration of the ribosomal target.
TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis media in Costa Rican children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the increasing number of resistant middle ear pathogens reported from different centers worldwide, an active surveillance of the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens is required for proper antimicrobial recommendations among different regions of the world. OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens obtained from Costa Rican children with acute otitis media. METHODS: Between 1992 and 1997 a diagnostic tympanocentesis was performed in 398 Costa Rican patients with acute otitis media. Middle ear fluid was obtained for culture and minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the E-test technique in those isolates obtained between October, 1995, and January, 1997. RESULTS: The most common pathogens cultured were Streptococcus pneumoniae (30%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Staphylococcus aureus (4%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (4%). Moraxella catarrhalis was uncommon. Beta-lactamase production was low (3.7%) among the H. influenzae isolates but frequent among the Staphylococcus aureus (57.1%) and M. catarrhalis (100%) strains. Overall 9 of 46 S. pneumoniae isolates (19.6%) exhibited decreased susceptibility to penicillin of which 8 isolates (17.4%) showed intermediate and one strain (2.2%) high level resistance. Among the penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to the following antimicrobials was: 81%, azithromycin; 89%, clarithromycin; and 100%, ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Among the penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates the percentage of susceptible strains was 89% for azithromycin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone and 67% for TMP-SMX. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this microbiologic information the agents considered first line drugs in the treatment of acute otitis media in Costa Rica remain amoxicillin or TMP-SMX.
TI  - Azithromycin. A review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  - Azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. Pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. In children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. These standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. Azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. Azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. Skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. Although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.
TI  - Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of Bush group 1 beta-lactamases. In vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against Gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli was studied. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. These included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The tested clinical isolates included Gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group D enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia). RESULTS: The activity of cefepime against most Gram-negative bacilli other than B cepacia and X maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. However, cefepime is less active against these Gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The activity of cefepime against B cepacia and X maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. Among Gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, S pyogenes, viridans streptococci and S pneumoniae. However, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant S aureus and enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Use of the lactococcal nisA promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  - We characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisA promoter in strains of the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. nisA promoter activity was dependent on the proteins NisR and NisK, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the extracellular inducer nisin. The nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. Significant induction of the nisA promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is inhibited. The efficiency of the nisA promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the Spac, xylA, and lacA promoters in B. subtilis and in S. pyogenes. Because nisA promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - Aetiology of acute epiglottitis in adults.
AB  - In order to determine the aetiology of acute epiglottitis in adults, blood cultures, paired sera and a urine sample were obtained from 54 patients with fever and epiglottitis visualized by indirect laryngoscopy or by direct fibreoptic nasolaryngoscopy. Antibodies were determined against the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), 3 pneumococcal antigens (a mixture of 23 capsular polysaccharides, C-polysaccharide and pneumolysin) and antistreptolysin O. Acute sera were examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for DNA of Hib and pneumococci. The urine samples were examined for Hib capsular antigen. Blood cultures were positive in 15 patients. In another 16, serology and/or PCR verified the aetiology. Hib was the cause in 14, pneumococci in 12 and group A streptococci in 5 patients. The aetiology remained unknown in 23/54 patients (43%). In conclusion, the addition of serology and PCR to blood cultures doubled the possibilities of verifying the aetiology of acute epiglottitis in adults.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activities of sanfetrinem cilexetil, a new oral tricyclic antibiotic.
AB  - The in vivo antibacterial activities of a new oral trinem, sanfetrinem cilexetil  (a prodrug of sanfetrinem), were evaluated in comparison with those of cefdinir and amoxicillin. Sanfetrinem cilexetil showed potent efficacy against experimental murine septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli and against murine respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Likewise, in murine models of respiratory infection by penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, sanfetrinem cilexetil was more effective than amoxicillin in reducing the number of bacteria in infected lungs. These results were reflected in its potent in vitro activity and high levels in plasma.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of macrolides against clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 6 macrolides was determined using a micro-broth dilution method, against 535 clinical isolates of 22 species, which were isolated in 1996 from 325 facilities in Japan. Results were as follows. 1. In general, antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were higher than those of 16-membered macrolides. The antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were in the order of clarithromycin (CAM), erythromycin (EM), roxithromycin (RXM). Among 16-membered macrolides, rokitamycin (RKM) was the most potent, josamycin (JM) was next potent followed by midecamycin (MDM). More numbers of highly-resistant strain of > 100 micrograms/ml were recognized in 14-membered macrolides than in 16-membered macrorides. 2. Most of S. pyogenes (group A) strains were distributed in the susceptible range and almost none was found in the resistant range. 3. S. pneumoniae strains were distributed widely from the susceptible range to the highly resistant range, and as high as 37.1% fell into the high resistance of > 100 micrograms/ml range. 4. Against Peptostreptococcus spp. and MRSA, 16-membered macrolides were more effective than 14-membered macrorlides, and their antibacterial activities were in the order of RKM, JM, MDM. Ratio of high-resistant strains of > 100 micrograms/ml against 14-membered macrolides was much higher than that against 16-membered macrolies. 5. Most of M. (B.) catarrhalis strains were distributed in the susceptible range of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml, and most of H. influenzae strains were distributed within the moderately resistant and the resistant ranges. 6. In M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae, no correlation between macrolide resistance and beta-lactamase production was recognized. 7. Most of C. jejuni strains were susceptible to all macrolides used in this study.
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin and tazobactam combination against clinically significant bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactum which is not among the routinely tested antibiotic at the Public Health Bacteriology Laboratory, Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe was evaluated for its activity against bacterial pathogens using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Piperacillin/tazobactum showed superior in-vitro activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria when compared with routinely tested antibiotics such as gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, penicillin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and clindamycin and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Ciprofloxacin showed in-vitro activity comparable to that of tazobactam/piperacillin. Specifically, 96% of gram positive isolates (comprising Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam. For gram negative organisms, 98% of Haemophilus influenzae Shigella spp, Klebsiella spp were also sensitive to the combination. The broad spectrum of activity of piperacillin/tazobactam shows that the potential of the drug combination for the treatment of infections caused by diverse microorganisms should not be underestimated. We recommend its inclusion in routine antibiotic sensitivity testing in our hospital.
TI  - Why have group A streptococci remained susceptible to penicillin? Report on a symposium.
AB  - In spite of 50 years of extensive use of penicillin, group A streptococci remain  exquisitely susceptible to this antibiotic. This observation that continuing susceptibility has occurred despite the development of resistance to other antimicrobial agents prompted a day-long meeting at Rockefeller University (New York) in October 1996. Among the most likely explanations for this remarkable state of continued susceptibility to penicillin are that beta-lactamase may not be expressed or may be toxic to the organism and/or that low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins either are not expressed or render organisms nonviable. Other potential explanations are that circumstances favorable for the development of resistance have not yet occurred and/or that there are inefficient mechanisms for or barriers to genetic transfer. Recommended future actions include (1) additional laboratory investigations of gene transfer, penicillin-binding proteins, virulence factors, and homeologous recombination and mismatch repair; (2) increased surveillance for the development of penicillin resistance; (3) application of bioinformatics to analyze streptococcal genome sequences; and (4) development of vaccines and novel antimicrobial agents. Thus far the susceptibility of group A streptococci to penicillin has not been a major clinical or epidemiological problem. A similar observation, however, could have been made decades ago about Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is therefore vital for the scientific community to closely examine why penicillin has remained uniformly highly active against group A streptococci in order to maintain this desirable state.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, against species representative of respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of BAY 12-8039, a novel 8-methoxy-quinolone,  was compared with those of other quinolones, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime and erythromycin against species commonly implicated in respiratory tract infections as well as viridans group streptococci. The new compound was highly active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 0.125 microgram/ml), penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MIC90 0.5 and MIC50 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively), penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci (MIC90 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively), group A streptococci (MIC90 0.25 microgram/ml), M. catarrhalis (MIC90 0.125 microgram/ml) and H. influenzae (MIC90 0.063 microgram/ml), irrespective of beta-lactamase production. It was, however, less active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively). The new compound demonstrated bactericidal activity at concentrations 2, 4, 8 times the MIC against representative isolates of the above collection. At a concentration of eight times the MIC, the frequency of spontaneous resistance ranged from 2.5 x 10(-7) to < 4 x 10(-8). These results suggested that BAY 12-8039 would be a promising agent for the eradication of respiratory tract pathogens and that clinical trials assessing its efficacy for the management of infections caused by these organisms are warranted.
TI  - Anhydrolide macrolides. 2. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2,3-anhydro-6-O-methyl 11,12-carbazate erythromycin A analogues.
AB  - A series of 3-descladinosyl-2,3-anhydro-6-O-methylerythromycin A 11, 12-cyclic carbazate analogues was prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity. These 2,3-anhydro macrolides were found to be potent antibacterial agents in vitro against macrolide-susceptible organisms including Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, Streptococcus pyogenes EES61, and Streptococcuspneumoniae ATCC6303. These compounds were also very active against some organisms that show macrolide resistance (S. aureus A5177, S. pyogenes PIU2584, and S. pneumoniae 5649). The compounds generally showed poor activity against organisms with constitutive MLS resistance. Selected compounds were evaluated in vivo in mouse protection studies. Although most of the compounds tested in vivo showed poor efficacy, two compounds, 38 and 57, were more active than clarithromycin against S. pneumoniae ATCC6303.
TI  - Anhydrolide macrolides. 1. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2,3-anhydro-6-O-methyl 11,12-carbamate erythromycin A analogues.
AB  - A series of 3-descladinosyl-2,3-anhydro-6-O-methylerythromycin A 11, 12-carbamate analogues have been synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. These compounds were found to be potent antibacterial agents against Gram-positive organisms in vitro, many having MIC values below 1 microg/mL for the macrolide-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as improved activity compared to erythromycin A against the inducibly MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B)-resistant organisms. Structure-activity studies revealed that arylalkyl carbamates with two and four carbon atoms between the aromatic moiety and carbamate nitrogen have the best in vitro activity. All of the C-10 epi analogues evaluated were found to have substantially less activity than the corresponding natural C-10 isomer. Several analogues demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity against the constitutively resistant S.aureus A-5278, S. pneumoniae5979, and S.pyogenes 930. However, despite potent in vitro activity, these analogues showed only moderate in vivo activity in mouse protection studies.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of newer oral cephalosporins in healthy volunteers.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity of three oral cephalosporins was studied in 12 volunteers, after administration of single doses of cefuroxime axetil 250 mg, cefixime 200 mg, cefixime 400 mg and cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg. Serum bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae was measured by a standardized microdilution method. Cefuroxime axetil demonstrated the best bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms and cefixime was the most bactericidal against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory tract infections during the pilgrimage (Haj) season in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and type of RTI-causing bacteria and viruses during a period of epidemic infections. METHOD: A total of 395 sputum specimens and 761 throat swabs were collected during the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons (Haj to Makkah Al-Mukarama, Saudi Arabia) from patients referred to one hospital and three dispensaries with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. All 761 throat swabs of both Haj seasons were also screened for the presence of viral pathogens with monoclonal antibodies specific for 7 viruses known to cause respiratory infections. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 118 (29.9%) specimens. During the 1991 Haj season Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen detected (10%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.8%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (2.4%). In the 1992 Haj season Klebsiella pneumoniae was predominant (15.1%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.3%). Screening of all sputum specimens for acid-fast bacteria showed that the overall incidence rate of tuberculosis was 1%. Cultures from the 761 throat swabs were largely negative for bacteria except for Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from 7 patients. Viruses were detected in 148 (19.5%) specimens with influenza A and adenovirus being the most common viruses. CONCLUSION: The pattern of virus prevalence in the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons was identical: influenza A and adenovirus predominated. Thus these two viruses should be targeted in future prophylactic measures.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - Identification of a novel insertion element, IS1548, in group B streptococci, predominantly in strains causing endocarditis.
AB  - Hyaluronidase has been postulated to be a virulence factor in group B streptococci (GBS). No hyaluronidase activity was found in 15 of 50 GBS isolates from adults studied. Most of these hyaluronidase-negative strains belonged to serotype III. In strains lacking hyaluronidase activity, an insertion of 1317 nucleotides was found in the hyaluronidase gene. The fragment was cloned and sequenced and found to have characteristics of a novel insertion sequence, designated IS1548. As well as in GBS serotype III, this sequence was found in 3 of 6 serotype II isolates and in all 10 group A streptococcal strains (GAS) tested. Homologies were found with repeated sequences in Streptococcus pneumoniae and with H repeats in Escherichia coli. All GBS strains harboring IS1548 and some GAS strains had one copy of IS1548 located downstream of the C5a peptidase gene. IS1548 was present in 9 of 13 GBS isolates from blood in endocarditis patients and in 3 of 22 vaginally colonizing strains.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - Discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  - A 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. Antibacterial assays against Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli imp- and a Candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. Screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position A (secondary amine), at the end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. Subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. The range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting the first-round active sublibraries. Pyridinopolyamine positions B (secondary benzylamine) and C (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. High-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18, and 21 with MICs of 1-5 microM against S. pyogenes and E. coli imp-. Using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position C and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position B with position D (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. Subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier II panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, S. pyogenes, S. pyogenes (wild-type), Streptomyces aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at MICs of 1-12 microM, whereas MICs for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were > 100 microM. These eight compounds were not active (> 100 microM) against fungus C. albicans.
TI  - Identification of a DNA cytosine methyltransferase gene in conjugative transposon Tn5252.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the 3.5-kb right junction fragment of the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252 was obtained. The DNA fragment was found to carry four putative genes one of which displayed a high degree of similarity to prokaryotic 5C-cytosine methyltransferases carrying multiple sequence specificities. No cognate endonuclease gene was detected in the sequenced DNA. Purified methylase polypeptide synthesized in a T7 promoter-controlled overexpression system was found to lack methylase activity while the cell extracts of host cells containing the recombinant plasmid carrying the methylase gene were active. In vivo mutations in the methylase gene did not seem to affect the transferability of the element.
TI  - Rapid lysis of gram-positive cocci for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using achromopeptidase.
AB  - To adapt pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to a busy clinical laboratory, we evaluated the use of achromopeptidase (ACP) as the sole agent for lysis of a variety of gram-positive cocci. Growth in an appropriate broth media was adjusted to a 3.0 McFarland density before aliquotting for washing and plug preparation. ACP incorporated into the agarose plugs, or added to the buffer solution, lysed cells in < 1 h when suspended in a Tris-NaCl buffer. Two 30-min washes in a Tris-EDTA buffer were sufficient to remove cellular debris without additional deproteination. Final PFGE results were obtained in approximately 48 h, including the initial broth subculturing.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Weekly oral azithromycin as prophylaxis for agents causing acute respiratory disease.
AB  - Since the 1950s the U.S. military has used intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin G (BPG) to control outbreaks of respiratory disease. In an effort to find an alternative prophylaxis, a randomized field trial was conducted among 1,016 male U.S. Marine trainee volunteers at high risk for respiratory disease. Participants were evaluated for evidence of acute respiratory infection by serological tests on pretraining and posttraining sera (63 days apart). Oral azithromycin prophylaxis (500 mg/w) outperformed BPG, preventing infection from Streptococcus pyogenes (Efficacy [E] = 84%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 63%-93%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (E = 80%; 95% CI, 50%-92%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (E = 64%; 95% CI, 25%-83%), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (E = 58%; 95% CI, 15%-79%) in comparison with results in a no-treatment group. Azithromycin group subjects reported few side effects and less respiratory symptoms than the BPG and no-treatment groups. According to serological tests, oral azithromycin is an effective alternative prophylaxis to BPG for military populations.
TI  - Bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay. The samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. As control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to Mueller-Hinton broth. In order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. Vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr. Similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in Mueller Hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. It seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of GV129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  - GV129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. It combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. Comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for GV129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes, including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). Against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, GV129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. GV129606 showed an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, GV129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed MIC90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with MIC90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. Against these species, GV129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with MIC90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii). Haemophilus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of GV129606. GV129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. It was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). The in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ED50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. GV129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ED50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mreA, from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. In PCR assays, total genomic DNA from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from this strain was cloned into lambda Zap II to construct a library of S. agalactiae genomic DNA. A clone, pAES63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in Escherichia coli was recovered. Deletion derivatives of pAES63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. Studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into E. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. This putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described Mef pump in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent MsrA pump in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Its gene has been designated mreA (for macrolide resistance efflux).
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil against community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Part II].
AB  - We investigated clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil (CEMT-PI) in community-acquired respiratory tract infections and obtained the following findings. That method was approximately equal to that of investigation in 1994. 1. Of the 431 respiratory tract infection cases that were treated with CEMT-PI according to a same protocol at a total of 41 institutions in Tokyo, Kanagawa-ken, Saitama-ken and Chiba-ken from January to the beginning of March 1996. Outpatients accounted for 98.1% of the subjects. Regarding genders to patients, slightly more females (52.6%) than males were included. Diagnoses given to these patients included pharyngo-laryngitis (53.5%), tonsillitis (20.4%) and acute bronchitis (19.1%). 2. We investigated clinical efficacy rates (the ratio of those excellent + good) classified by diseases. The improvement rates of pharyngo-laryngitis, tonsillitis and acute bronchitis were more than 85.0%. Other cases were small in number. That of chronic bronchitis-acute increasing change for the worse was 66.7%, pneumonia was 50.0% and bronchiectasis infection was 16.7%. It was not studied that clinical efficacy rates among those who were treated with 1 CEMT-PI tablet twice and among those who were given 2 tablets twice were significant level. 3. For the bacteriological study, a written material describing the method of collecting specimens, storage and transport in detail was distributed to the above mentioned institutions. The isolation and identification of suspected causative bacteria, determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and investigation of beta-lactamase production were conducted all together at section of studies, Tokyo Clinical Research Center. Suspected causative bacteria were detected from 274 (63.6%) cases. They included 88 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 47 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 42 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. Suspected causative bacteria classified by diseases were S. pyogenes (tonsillitis), S. pneumoniae (acute bronchitis and secondary infection of chronic respiratory infection) and H. influenzae (pharyngo-laryngitis), and the detection frequency of those was high. The clinical efficacies (the ratio of improvement) classified by suspected causative bacteria were 84.4% against organism that was indicating CEMT and were 69.2% against organism that was not indicating CEMT.
TI  - In vitro activity of trimethoprim alone compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species associated with upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used to treat various respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, for many patients, intolerance of the sulfonamide component precludes use of this combination. This study examined the activity of trimethoprim alone in comparison to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species implicated in respiratory tract infections. For Haemophilus influenzae, minimal inhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim were equal to or one dilution greater than those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with 56 of 58 strains inhibited by the former at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml. All oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 96.7% of Streptococcus pyogenes were inhibited by trimethoprim < or = 2 micrograms/ml. In contrast, only 50% of Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by this concentration of trimethoprim, whereas 93.3% were susceptible to the combination at < or = 2/38 micrograms/ml. All oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and all Moraxella catarrhalis were resistant to trimethoprim, although many of the former and all of the latter were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Incidence of bacteremia in infants and children with fever and petechiae.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We determined the incidence of serious invasive bacteremia caused by Neisseria meningitidis and other organisms in febrile infants and children with a petechial rash. Further, we studied the diagnostic value of laboratory and clinical finding in these patients. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted this prospective cohort study in the emergency department of an urban pediatric teaching hospital, during an 18-month period, and enrolled consecutive patients with temperature of 38 degrees C or higher and petechiae. Our measures included (1) laboratory tests (leukocyte count, coagulation profile, blood culture, and cerebrospinal fluid bacterial culture); (2) a questionnaire requesting clinical data including general appearance, number and location of petechiae, and presence or absence of purpura; and (3) a follow-up telephone survey documenting health status. RESULTS: A total of 411 patients were enrolled, with 57.7% between 3 and 36 months of age. Eight patients (1.9%) had bacteremia or clinical sepsis. Six had serious invasive bacteremia: N. meningitidis (two patients), group A streptococcus (one), or sepsis with negative culture results (three). Two had occult bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and no evidence of sepsis. No patient had a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture result. None of the 357 well-appearing patients (95% confidence interval: 0.0%, 1.0%) had serious invasive bacteremia. Fifty-three patients appeared ill, including all six with serious invasive bacteremia. Ill appearance of the child had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval: 0.60, 1.00), and a leukocyte count of 15,000 or greater, or of less than 5000, had a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 1.00) for detecting serious invasive bacteremia. All children with meningococcemia had purpura. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive bacteremia occurred less frequently in our study than in previous series and was identified by clinical criteria. Our data support the treatment of selected well-appearing children with fever and petechiae as outpatients.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - mefE is necessary for the erythromycin-resistant M phenotype in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Recently, it was shown that a significant number of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes strains contain a determinant that mediates resistance via a putative efflux pump. The gene encoding the erythromycin-resistant determinant was cloned and sequenced from three strains of S. pneumoniae bearing the M phenotype (macrolide resistant but clindamycin and streptogramin B susceptible). The DNA sequences of mefE were nearly identical, with only 2-nucleotide differences between genes from any two strains. When the mefE sequences were compared to the mefA sequence from S. pyogenes, the two genes were found to be closely related (90% identity). Strains of S. pneumoniae were constructed to confirm that mefE is necessary to confer erythromycin resistance and to explore the substrate specificity of the pump; no substrates other than 14- and 15-membered macrolides were identified.
TI  - Ceftibuten: a new expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of ceftibuten, a new expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-June 1996) of the medical literature, review of English-language literature and bibliographies of these articles, and data on file. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published and unpublished trials and abstracts that mentioned ceftibuten. Additional information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and pharmacokinetic profile of ceftibuten also was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ceftibuten, an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and selected gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Ceftibuten is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. Ceftibuten is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily eliminated renally as unchanged drug. The elimination half-life of ceftibuten is slightly longer than 2 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. The adverse effect profile is equal to that of comparator agents. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftibuten is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents with convenient once-daily dosing in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, ceftibuten has antimicrobial activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and is stable in the presence of many beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.
TI  - [Clinical efficacy in pediatrics sinusitis infections of cefditoren pivoxil granule therapy and its in vitro antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficacy in pediatrics sinusitis infections of cefditoren pivoxil granule therapy and its in vitro antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains. The results are summarized as follows. The specimens from 343 patients were cultured and 595 strains of bacteria were isolated and identified. Oral doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg of CDTR-PI were clinically effective at high percentages, 85.1% and 89.5%, respectively, of treated patients. CDTR-PI at 3 mg/kg orally was clinically effective in 80.8% of patients with PCG intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) infections, 80.0% of those with PCG susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) infections, 81.8% of those with H. influenzae infections and 78.3% of those with M. (B.) catarrhalis infections among the infections by major causative agents. The frequent isolates included S. pneumoniae accounting for 33.1%, H. influenzae accounting for 32.1%, M. (B.) catarrhalis accounting for 17.6% and S. pyogenes accounting 3.7% of all the isolates. PISP accounted for 16.1% of all the isolates and for 49.8% of the isolates of S. pneumoniae, and were isolated from 28.6% of the 343 patients. The isolation of PISP was frequent from children of 4 and under especially, and especially frequent from those below age 2. Of the isolates of S. pneumoniae, the biotype frequencies among PSSP were in the order of type I > type II > type III, while those among PISP were in the order of type I < type II with none of type III. Bacteriologically, an eradication rate of 89.4% was achieved with 3 mg/kg and 93.5% with 5 mg/kg of CDTR-PI.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - The purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (RXM). We measured the MICs of macrolide antibiotics, such as RXM, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), rokitamycin (RKM) and midecamycin (MDM), and other classes of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between October and December in 1994 and 1995. RXM had excellent antibacterial activities for S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and methicillin sensitive S. aureus. Against methicillin sensitive S. epidermidis, RXM activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had MIC > or = 128 micrograms/ml. The activity against S. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of EM, CAM, MDM, and clindamycin. The vast majority of methicillin resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. In conclusion, RXM is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus except MRSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis and M. pneumoniae.
TI  - Group A streptococcal bacteremia. A 10-year prospective study.
AB  - In this paper we present a prospective evaluation of 100 patients with Group A Streptococcal (GAS) bacteremia evaluated in our hospital over a 10-year period. Sixty-two patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU); all but 1 of these had an obvious cutaneous portal of entry related to the injection of illicit drugs. Twenty-seven patients had infectious metastasis, and the presence of septic pulmonary embolism was associated with suppurative phlebitis. Four of these patients had endocarditis. In the non-IVDU group, 24 patients had an underlying disease, and 12 were immunosuppressed. In 14 cases the infection was of hospital acquisition; in 35% infection was related to medical manipulations. Comparing the IVDU and non-IVDU groups, GAS bacteremia in IVDU patients is associated with a more benign outcome, a longer time of evolution before diagnosis, and a lower frequency of septic shock and mortality than in non-IVDU patients. Although in the univariate analysis GAS bacteremia was associated with several variables, in the multivariate analysis only the presence of shock and nosocomial acquisition of the infection were independently associated with a fatal outcome. Fifty-two patients were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 5 of these were in the non-IVDU group. During the last 5 years of study, GAS bacteremia in our hospital was 39 times more frequent in HIV-infected patients than in patients without HIV. Nine patients presented clinical criteria corresponding to Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), although its incidence was lower in the IVDU group. In the non-IVDU group, STSS was more frequent in patients with a necrotizing portal of entry, an age between 20 and 40 years, women, and when the origin of the infection was the skin or soft tissue. Six patients with STSS died, and death was associated with the presence of necrotizing lesions and lower counts of white cells, platelets, or hemoglobin.

TI  - Differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  - The in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1ra. Gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra. In addition, blood was stimulated with E. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. E. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 production but levels of IL-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed E. coli. In contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed E. coli; polymyxin B decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Clarithromycin. A review of its efficacy in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients.
AB  - Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibacterial agent active in vitro  and effective in vivo against the major pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients. It is highly active in vitro against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides against Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent drug and metabolite are combined in vitro. Absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food. More than half of an oral dose is systemically available as the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the dosage. First-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active metabolite 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin in plasma. Clarithromycin and its active metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the respiratory tract than in plasma. Dosage adjustments are required for patients with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment. Drug interactions related to the cytochrome P450 system may occur with clarithromycin use. In addition to the standard immediate-release formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of clarithromycin is now available for use once daily. In dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and community settings as beta-lactam agents (with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. Clarithromycin was similar in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin. Adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with erythromycin. Clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy to that seen with beta-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other macrolides. It offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use in US hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations. The spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of BAY 12-8039 on gram-positive and gram-negative organisms as demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - Time-kill kinetics of BAY 12-8039 were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of BAY 12-8039 were studied on three strains each of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pharmacodynamic data demonstrated that BAY 12-8039 has marked activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions) and anaerobes. BAY 12-8039 also exhibited a postantibiotic effect of >1 h for all strains except one E. coli strain.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  - The incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. As the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. Problematic pathogens include strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. Other important pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups B, C, and G, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of Listeria and Corynebacterium and Gram-positive anaerobes, such as Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. Thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. The novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.
TI  - Lancefield grouping and smell of caramel for presumptive identification and assessment of pathogenicity in the Streptococcus milleri group.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate Lancefield grouping and caramel smell for presumptive identification of the Streptococcus milleri group, and to find whether Lancefield group, species, or protein profile correlated with virulence or infection site. METHODS: Prospective studies were made of 100 consecutive streptococcal isolates in blood cultures or pus from 100 patients in whom the severity of infection was categorised as serious, moderate, or not significant. The usefulness of Lancefield group and the caramel smell for presumptive identification was examined, and the relation of the S milleri species, Lancefield group, and SDS-PAGE protein analysis to severity of infection and infection site was investigated. Lower respiratory tract and genital tract specimens, strict anaerobes, group D streptococci, and strains identified as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae were excluded. RESULTS: Most streptococci occurring in pure or significant growth density were S milleri group (87/100; 87%, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.93). Of these, 89.7% (78/87; 0.84-0.96) were associated with infection. Lancefield group F antigen predominated (41/87; 47.1%, 0.38-0.56). Lancefield group F alone or accompanied by the caramel smell had a specificity of 100%, but a sensitivity of only 47.3% for group F alone, and 19.5% for group F accompanied by the caramel smell. There was no significant association between species, Lancefield group, and severity of infection, site of infection, or pathogenicity. SDS-PAGE analysis failed to discriminate between strains. CONCLUSIONS: Neither species nor Lancefield antigen was related to the site of infection. The presence of Lancefield group F antigen alone or accompanied by a caramel smell was a useful indicator for the S milleri group when present, but was too insensitive to use as a screening test. Most streptococci occurring in pure culture or in significant growth density were of clinical importance. Such organisms should be identified to species level to detect the S milleri group.
TI  - Causative pathogens, antibiotic resistance and therapeutic considerations in acute otitis media.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most frequently isolated pathogens in patients with acute otitis media (AOM). Other potential causative pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes in older children and Chlamydia pneumoniae in younger children. The recent emergence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and the increasing frequency of beta-lactamase-producing strains of M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae are creating concerns regarding the use of amoxicillin as traditional first line empiric therapy for AOM in younger children. Both the in vitro antibiotic activity against these more resistant causative pathogens and the antibiotic concentrations achieved in middle ear fluid must be considered when selecting antibiotics for treatment of refractory AOM. The newer macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, provide reasonable in vitro coverage against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, although azithromycin is more active against the latter. Both drugs also achieve notably higher, sustained concentrations in middle ear fluid than do beta-lactam antibiotics. Thus the newer macrolides represent important new rational alternatives for the management of AOM.
TI  - History of macrolide use in pediatrics.
AB  - Erythromycin, the prototypical macrolide, has been widely used since the 1950s in the management of pediatric infections. Erythromycin is the drug of choice for infants and children with Legionnaire's disease, pertussis, diphtheria, lower respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis and enteritis caused by Campylobacter jejuni. It is also indicated for treatment of syphilis; for streptococcal, staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections; genital infections caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum; and for the prevention of rheumatic fever and endocarditis in patients who are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. The new macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are also active against Borrelia burgdorferi, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, Cryptosporidium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. Erythromycin is associated with a low risk of serious side effects, although gastric distress occurs in a significant proportion of patients. Drug interactions with theophylline, carbamazepine, warfarin, cyclosporine, terfenadine and digoxin limit erythromycin use. The newer macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are more stable, better absorbed and better tolerated than erythromycin. Azithromycin is more active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae. Excellent tissue and intracellular penetration may contribute to their clinical efficacy. In children both azithromycin and clarithromycin are indicated for acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis and for pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. (As of December, 1996, azithromycin for oral suspension was approved for community-acquired pneumonia in children caused by C. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae.) Claritromycin is also indicated for acute maxillary sinusitis, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia and disseminated mycobacterial infections. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, a low rate of drug discontinuation caused by side effects and a low potential for interaction with other drugs.
TI  - [Clinical study on azithromycin in 10% fine granules and 100mg capsules in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new oral macrolide antibiotic, in 10% fine granules or 100  mg capsules was given to pediatric patients to treat various infections. The following results were obtained in our studies of AZM for its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, its pharmacokinetics, its efficacy, and its safety. 1. MICs of AZM, erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM) were determined against a total of 57 strains all at 10(6) cfu/ml. Among Gram-positive cocci, MICs of AZM ranged from 0.78 to > 100 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (20 strains), from 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (11 strains), and from 0.0125 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains). These MICs were similar to those of the other macrolides. Among Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of AZM were 0.05 micrograms/ml against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (1 strain), from 0.78 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (9 strains), 0.78 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 strain) and 6.25 micrograms/ml against salmonella sp. (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of the other macrolides. Against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, MICs of AZM were < or = 0.0008 micrograms/ml in three strains. One strain of M. pneumoniae showed tolerance to AZM at MIC 25 micrograms/ml. The other agents exhibited higher MIC than AZM against this organism. 2. Plasma samples were collected from five patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules for drug level determination. The patients received AZM at 10.0 approximately 16.3 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days. Drug concentrations in plasma at two hours after Day 3 dosing were in a range between 0.02 and 0.19 micrograms/ml for fine granules and were in a range between 0.11 and 0.42 micrograms/ml for capsules. 3. Urine samples were collected from four patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules. Drug levels were determined to be 3 micrograms/ml at post-treatment 48 hours for fine granules and post-treatment 72 hours for capsules. Urinary excretion rates of AZM in three patients on capsules lied in a range between 4.69 and 10.17%. 4. Effectiveness of AZM in fine granules was evaluated in 128 patients having a total of 19 different infections. AZM was rated "excellent" in 51 patients, "good" in 63, "fair" in 8, "poor" in 6, resulting in an efficacy rate of 89.1%. Effectiveness of AZM in capsular form was evaluated in 23 patients with five different infections. AZM was found "excellent" in 13 patients and "good" in 10, resulting in an efficacy rate of 100%. 5. AZM in fine granules eradicated 45 strains of 54 in 8 different bacteria. AZM in capsules eradicated 9 strains of 10 strains in 6 different bacteria. 6. As for adverse reactions, one patient complained of eruption, one vomiting, one loose stool, five diarrhea, when administered with fine granular form of AZM. One patient on AZM capsules experienced urticaria and vomiting. 7. As for abnormal laboratory changes, three patients were found with decreased WBC, seven with increased eosinophil, two with increased GOT and GPT, one with increased GPT. They were all on fine granular form of AZM. As far as abnormalities found in patients administered with AZM in capsular form, two showed decreased WBC, one decreased WBC along with increased eosinophil, and three increased eosinophil.
TI  - Kinetics of specific salivary IgA responses in man after oral challenge by ribosomal immunostimulant.
AB  - The kinetics of specific IgA mucosal responses was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers over 3 weeks of treatment by oral administration of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, composed of ribosomes from the four bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The levels of IgA specific for these four bacteria increased after each immunization and, after the third week of treatment, were significantly higher than baseline day 0 values. This study demonstrates that oral ribosomal immunostimulation results in the production of specific salivary antibodies liable to recognize whole bacteria antigens, and therefore likely to confer protection. The kinetic analysis performed also demonstrates the rapidity of specific mucosal immune responses after oral stimulation in man, a feature still seldom explored.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem, a new oral penem antibiotic, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. Time-kill kinetics were employed against strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of faropenem were studied using strains of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that faropenem has bactericidal activity. Faropenem exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect against all strains except H. influenzae.

TI  - Role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  - We describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. For comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of S. aureus, two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. All except two strains of S. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. When S. aureus NUMR1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. Multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. When 14 strains of clinically isolated S. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (P < 0.01) but not with the titer of clumping factor. Injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain DU5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain DU5789. Our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. Our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes in respiratory tract infections in outpatients.
AB  - Sensitivity patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes were studied prospectively in an outpatient population seeking medical advice for respiratory tract infections (RTI) in the Southern parts of Stockholm. In total, 3,214 nasopharyngeal and 1,907 throat swabs were cultured during January-February 1996. 32% of the patients had received antibiotics during the previous year. Reduced penicillin sensitivity in S. pneumoniae was rare (1.3%) and only seen in patients treated with antibiotics during the previous 4 months. Beta-lactamase production in H. influenzae was found in 13.4% of patients who had been treated with antibiotics during the last 4 months and in 7.9% of the others. No resistance (< 1%) to erythromycin was seen in S. pyogenes. In this population-based surveillance, the levels of resistance in common respiratory tract pathogens were thus low and correlated to previous antibiotic treatment. Strict indications for antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated RTI are advocated to maintain a low resistance rate. Penicillin is still the drug of choice in patients without frequent recurrences of RTI in a setting similar to the one studied.
TI  - Carriage of multiresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae among children attending day-care centres in the Stockholm area.
AB  - To determine the prevalence of the asymptomatic carriage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) by children attending day-care centres in the Stockholm area, nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured from 1129 children and 308 day-care personnel in 36 day-care centres during a 3-week period, from March to April 1995. Approximately 36% of the children were asymptomatic carriers of S. pneumoniae sensitive to penicillin and other antibiotics. The highest prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage was found in the 2-year-old group (50%), whereas among the 4-year-old children colonization was observed in 42%, and among the 7-year-old children 21% were asymptomatic carriers of penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae. In 2 day-care centres, 4 and 5 children, respectively, were found to have DRSP strains in the nasopharynx. The same serotype of DRSP strain was found among the children attending the same day-care centre. During the same period, none of the staff were found to harbour DRSP in the nasopharynx, but 3% were asymptomatic carriers of penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae. The patterns of nasopharyngeal colonization by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Group A streptococci were also studied in 635 children during the same period. 42% of the nasal cultures yielded Moraxella, 32% H. influenzae and 2% Streptococcus pyogenes.

The drug was administered in a dose of 20-40 mg/kg body weight a day in 3 portions. The treatment course was 4 to 10 days. The treatment was performed under careful clinicoroent-genologic control. The clinical picture of the disease in the children was characterized by a moderate process which made it possible to treat the children as outpatients. The clinical efficacy amounted to 90.5 per cent. The isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae proved to be susceptible to A/PC. It may be used as the 1st class agent in the treatment of children with lower respiratory tract infection.
TI  - [Occurrence of Moraxella catarrhalis in patients with respiratory tract infections].
AB  - The study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of Moraxella catarrhalis in patients with respiratory tract infections. Overall 514 specimens including 370 throat swabs and 114 sputum specimens were examined. The 78 strains isolated basing on morphological and biochemical characteristics were classified as Moraxella catarrhalis. The sensitivity of the strains to antibiotics was also estimated. The frequency of M. catarrhalis isolation from the throat swabs (15.9%) was higher than from the sputum (13.2%). Selected 25 specimens of sputum were tested simultaneously by quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative method was more sensitive (84% positive findings) than qualitative method (60% positive findings). Resistance to ampicillin was found in 52 (66.7%) strains of M. catarrhalis determined mainly by beta-lactamase production (over 70% strains were producers of beta-lactamase). All strains were sensitive to ofloxacin and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid combination. The frequency of M. catarrhalis isolation was higher in autumn-winter period than in summer (May-September). We conclude that M. catarrhalis, beside Streptococcus pyogenes (20.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.1%), are the most frequently isolated bacteria in patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Effectiveness of ribosomal fractions of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and the membrane fraction of Kp (Ribomunyl) in the prevention of clinical recurrences of infectious rhinitis. Results of a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  - A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. This trial involved 327 patients (168 Ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. The main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. An additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. Ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the Ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (P = 0.001). The protective effect of Ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% CI: 0.43-0.78, P = 0.0001). Analysis of secondary criteria also favored Ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; P = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; P = 0.002).

TI  - Do simple laboratory tests help in etiologic diagnosis in acute maxillary sinusitis?
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the results of such simple hematologic tests as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) could give any useful information about the causative agents in 176 patients with acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS). The great majority of tests (82%) showed values which were within normal limits. This may be due to the fact that 22% of AMS cases were culture negative for bacteria and about 60% of culture positive cases had Haemophilus influenzae as the etiologic agent. Significantly raised test values were seen in connection with Streptococcus pyogenes in the majority of cases, less frequently with Streptococcus pneumoniae and rarely with Haemophilus influenzae. We conclude that none of the evaluated routine blood tests are particularly sensitive indicators of the specific etiology of AMS in general. However, elevated CRP values (> 40 mg/l) associated with AMS should alert the physician to the suspicion of Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae in etiology, since both, if left untreated, may lead to sinus empyema. With CRP or other evaluated tests Haemophilus influenzae- or Branhamella catarrhalis-positive AMS cannot be distinguished from a purely viral disease.
TI  - A novel pathway for O-polysaccharide biosynthesis in Salmonella enterica serovar  Borreze.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded gene cluster for O:54 O-polysaccharide synthesis in Salmonella enterica serovar Borreze (rfbO:54) contains three genes that direct synthesis of a ManNAc homopolymer with alternating beta1,3 and beta1,4 linkages. In Escherichia coli K-12, RfbAO:54 adds the first ManNAc residue to the Rfe (UDP-GlcpNAc::undecaprenylphosphate GlcpNAc-1-phosphate transferase)- modified lipopolysaccharide core. Hydrophobic cluster analysis of RfbAO:54 indicates this protein belongs to the ExoU family of nonprocessive beta-glycosyltransferases. Two putative catalytic residues and a potential substrate-binding motif were identified in RfbAO:54. Topological analysis of RfbBO:54 predicts four transmembrane domains and a large central cytoplasmic domain. The latter shares homology with a similar domain in the processive beta-glycosyltransferases Cps3S of Streptococcus pneumoniae and HasA of Streptococcus pyogenes. Hydrophobic cluster analysis of RfbBO:54 and Cps3S indicates both possess the structural features characteristic of the HasA family of processive beta-glycosyltransferases. Four potential catalytic residues and a putative substrate-binding motif were identified in RfbBO:54. In Deltarfb E. coli K-12, RfbAO:54 and RfbBO:54 direct synthesis of smooth O:54 lipopolysaccharide, indicating that this O-polysaccharide involves a novel pathway for O-antigen transport. Based on sequence and structural conservation, 15 new ExoU-related and 17 new HasA-related transferases were identified.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of azithromycin in pediatric infections].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM) was studied for its concentrations in plasma and urine, efficacy and safety. 1. Plasma and urine samples were collected from one patient diagnosed as having Mycoplasma pneumonia for drug level determination. The drug was given once daily at 9.7 mg/kg body weight for three days. The drug concentrations in plasma was 0.149 microgram/ml in 12 hours after the start of the treatment, and 0.095 microgram/ml at the point of 24 hours after the end of the treatment. Urinary recovery rate up to 72 hours post-dosing was 6.39%. 2. The effectiveness of AZM was assessed in 19 patients with following diagnoses: pharyngitis in two patients, bronchitis in four, pneumonia in seven and Mycoplasma pneumonia in six. The drug was rated "excellent" in 11, "good" in seven, "poor" in one, resulting in an efficacy rate of 94.7%. 3. AZM eradicated two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in patients. 4. The AZM MIC's were 0.39 microgram/ml against Staphylococcus aureus, 0.20 microgram/ml against S. pneumoniae, < or = 0.0008 microgram/ml against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 5. One patient complained of mild diarrhea, while another showed a slight increase in eosinophils, suggesting an abnormal laboratory change. In conclusion, AZM was found useful in treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of azithromycin using fine granules or capsules in the pediatric patients].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, in fine granules and in capsules  was studied for pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations. 1. Antibacterial activities. MIC profile of AZM was as follows: 0.78 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.10 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.10 approximately 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.39 microgram/ml against Moraxella(Branhamella) catarrhalis, 0.39 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and 0.20 approximately 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 2. Absorption and excretion. The elimination half-life of AZM after its administration at 10 mg/kg/day for three days was 28.1 approximately 46.1 hours. The cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 120 hours after start of treatment was 4.01 approximately 8.47%. 3. Clinical evaluation. AZM was given to 76 pediatric patients to treat following infections: pharyngitis in seven, tonsillitis in 11, bronchitis in 11, pneumonia in 19, Mycoplasma pneumonia in eight, scarlet fever in 13, infective enteritis in one, SSTI in four, and otitis media in two. Effectiveness of AZM was assessed in 75 patients and the drug was rated "excellent" or "good" in 71 resulting in an efficacy rate of 94.7%, 87.0% of the 46 cases indicated that AZM had eradicated bacteria identified before the treatment. One patient complained of moderate diarrhea which disappeared after treatment of anti-diarrheic. Abnormal laboratory changes were reported in 12 patients in the following: decreased leukocytes in eight, increased eosinophils in two, increased platelet count in one, and increased GPT in one. All cases of abnormality was deemed mild in severity and clinically insignificant.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of azithromycin in pediatric infections].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM) was studied for its clinical efficacy in pediatric infections. The study on AZM was carried out in 43 patients whose diagnoses were given as follows: pharyngitis in five cases, tonsillitis in one, bronchitis in four, pneumonia in four, Mycoplasma pneumonia in 14, scarlet fever in nine, impetigo in four, pyodermia in one and Campylobacter enteritis in one. The patients received AZM once daily at 1.6 approximately 20.0 mg/kg body weight for three to five days. Effectiveness of AZM was evaluated in 39 cases and the drug was rated "excellent" in 15, "good" in 19, "fair" in one, "poor" in four, resulting in an efficacy rate of 87.2%. Twenty bacterial isolates were identified as causative isolates in 19 patients: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AZM eradicated 16 isolates but four persisted after therapy. One patient complained of loose stool, while two patients were found with decreases in white blood cell counts, and seven showed increases in eosinophils. However, no serious case of adverse event was reported.
TI  - A multinational European survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five European countries. In terms of both MIC90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against Mycoplasma catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of Staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. Rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. Against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. Against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of MIC90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. In many cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. However, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. The findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - A multicenter, open label trial of azithromycin vs. amoxicillin/ clavulanate for  the management of acute otitis media in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized, open label study compared the efficacy and safety of  a 5-day course of once daily azithromycin to those of a 10-day course of three times daily amoxicillin/ clavulanate. METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine children with confirmed acute bacterial otitis media were randomized to treatment with 10 mg/kg of azithromycin oral suspension on Day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for the next 4 days or 40 mg/kg/ day of amoxicillin/clavulanate suspension in three divided doses for 10 days. Clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated on Days 11 and 30. RESULTS: Analysis of evaluable patients 11 days after the start of treatment demonstrated that 87.8% of patients treated with azithromycin and 100.0% of the patients treated with amoxicillin/ clavulanate were cured or improved. Presumed bacteriologic eradication of the baseline pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes was comparable in the two groups: 87.8% in patients treated with azithromycin; and 100.0% in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate. At Day 30, 82.2% of patients treated with azithromycin and 80.0% of patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate were cured or improved. Presumed bacteriologic eradication of the base-line pathogens was similar in the two groups: 82.2% in patients treated with azithromycin; and 81.1% in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate. Relapses occurred in 5.1% of patients receiving azithromycin and 21.1% of patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate (P = 0.047). Treatment-related side effects occurred in 3.5% of the azithromycin patients compared with 31.0% of amoxicillin/clavulanate patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in achieving clinical cure or improvement and presumed eradication of baseline pathogens in pediatric patients with acute otitis media. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated and was associated with fewer relapses than seen after amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy.
TI  - Antagonism of teicoplanin and vancomycin activity by chocolatized Mueller-Hinton  agar.
AB  - Chocolatized (80 degrees C, 13 min) Mueller-Hinton agar antagonized the inhibitory activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This antagonism was due to heat-exposed sheep erythrocytes, sheep hemoglobin, and the supernatant fluid from lysed sheep erythrocytes, but not to sheep serum. Neither water-soluble cholesterol, bovine albumin, bovine serum, hematin, hemin nor egg yolk suspension antagonized teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies that recognize a common pneumococcal protein with similarities to streptococcal group A surface glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were produced in a search for common pneumococcal proteins. One of the fusions generated two MAbs, 174,B-8 (immunoglobulin G2a) and 177,D-8 (immunoglobulin G1), which by Western blotting (immunoblotting) stained with a main band of 40 kDa found in all isolates of S. pneumoniae examined. Cross-reactivity studies with streptococci other than pneumococci revealed very weak or moderate reactions with the MAbs. The 40-kDa protein was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography and subsequent preparative Western blotting. N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed 90% amino acid sequence homology with a surface-located glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus pyogenes. This protein has also been reported to exhibit binding to mammalian proteins such as fibronectin, which may serve as host receptors. The epitopes for MAbs 174,B-8 and 177,D-8 reacting with the pneumococcal analog were not accessible to antibody binding in live bacteria but were exposed after heat killing. The MAbs showed negligible cross-reactions with S. pyogenes.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity and post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Recent macrolide derivatives, roxithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin show more favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison to old ones and some differences in antibacterial activity. With the aim of improving our understanding of some aspects of their action against respiratory pathogens, we determined the MICs and MBCs of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. Azithromycin was the most active agent against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, while clarithromycin was more active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs similar to those of erythromycin. The bactericidal activity of all tested derivatives was weak against Staphylococcus aureus (MBC/MIC ratio approximately 16) and against Moraxella catarrhalis (MBC/MIC ratio, 8-16), but good against Staphylococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MBC/MIC ratio, 2-4). The determination of killing curves in the presence of 2 MIC and 10 MIC of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin confirmed their weak bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis as well as their effective activity against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Azithromycin showed the highest bactericidal activity against Haemophilus influenzae. As expected, the three derivatives produced a quite prolonged PAE when exposed to 5 MIC for 1 h, ranging between 2-4 h. The bactericidal activity and the prolonged PAE of new macrolides for the most common respiratory pathogens should assure a good clinical activity in respiratory infections including those sustained by Haemophilus influenzae, which is less susceptible to erythromycin and other old macrolides.

TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides but sensitive to clindamycin: a common resistance pattern mediated by an efflux system.
AB  - Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from Finland, Australia, and  the United Kingdom and, more recently, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes strains from the United States were shown to have an unusual resistance pattern to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B antibiotics. This pattern, referred to as M resistance, consists of susceptibility to clindamycin and streptogramin B antibiotics but resistance to 14- and 15-membered macrolides. An evaluation of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance phenotypes among our streptococcal strains collected from 1993 to 1995 suggested that this unusual resistance pattern is not rare. Eighty-five percent (n = 66) of the S. pneumoniae and 75% (n = 28) of the S. pyogenes strains in our collection had an M phenotype. The mechanism of M resistance was not mediated by target modification, as isolated ribosomes from a pneumococcal strain bearing the M phenotype were fully sensitive to erythromycin. Further, the presence of an erm methylase was excluded with primers specific for an erm consensus sequence. However, results of studies that determined the uptake and incorporation of radiolabeled erythromycin into cells were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. The putative efflux determinant in streptococci seems to be distinct from the multicomponent macrolide efflux system in coagulase-negative staphylococci. The recognition of the prevalence of the M phenotype in streptococci has implications for sensitivity testing and may have an impact on the choice of antibiotic therapy in clinical practice.
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  - Diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Streptococcus bovis, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes. Principal components analysis of the FT-IR spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their FT-IR spectra. By contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their FT-IR spectra. These results demonstrate that the combination of FT-IR and ANNs provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.
TI  - An open comparative study of azithromycin and roxithromycin in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - An open, multicentre study was undertaken in order to evaluate the efficacies and safety profiles of azithromycin and roxithromycin in 440 adults with acute otitis media, sinusitis or acute beta-haemiolytic streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis. Treatment with 500 mg azithromycin, administered orally once daily for 3 days, produced a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) in 51/52 (98%) patients with otitis media, 91/91 (100%) patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis and 64/68 (94%) patients with sinusitis. Treatment with 150 mg roxithromycin, given orally twice daily for 10 days, produced satisfactory clinical responses in 54/55 (98%), 91/92 (99%) and 69/73 (94%) patients with otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis and sinusitis respectively. Of the 17 azithromycin-treated patients with sinusitis who were clinically and bacteriologically evaluable, Staphylococcus aureus persisted in two and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one. S. aureus also persisted in 1/12 clinically and bacteriologically-evaluable patient treated with roxithromycin. Of the 58 and 64 patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis treated with azithromycin and roxithromycin, respectively, who were clinically and bacteriologically evaluable, Streptococcus pyogenes persisted at the end of treatment in 7/58 (12%) in the azithromycin group and in 13/64 (20%) in the roxithromycin group. At follow-up, there was no evidence of S. pyogenes reinfection in patients treated with azithromycin. Three episodes of reinfection occurred in the roxithromycin treatment group. Also, three patients showed evidence of clinical relapse at follow-up, although no pathogens were isolated. Azithromycin was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events. No azithromycin-treated patient was withdrawn prematurely because of a treatment-related event. Three roxithromycin-treated patients were withdrawn from treatment because of severe headache, thyroiditis or fatigue. In conclusion, for adults with acute upper respiratory tract infections, a 3-day course of once-daily azithromycin was found to be as effective and as well tolerated as a 10-day course of twice-daily roxithromycin.
TI  - Correlation of increased azithromycin concentrations with phagocyte infiltration  into sites of localized infection.
AB  - Azithromycin reaches high concentrations in phagocytic and other host cells, suggesting that they may transport this agent to specific sites of infection. Models of localized infection (Haemophilus influenzae middle ear infection in gerbils, Streptococcus pyogenes implanted contaminated paper disc and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia in mice) that induced severe inflammatory response after challenge were used to explore this hypothesis. Animals were given a single 100 or 50 mg/kg po dose of azithromycin at various times from 2 to 120 h following introduction of a pathogen or sterile medium. When azithromycin was given during a period of little or no inflammation, there was marginal difference between concentrations found in infected or non-infected sites (bulla, disc, lung). However, when the compound was given during a period of inflammation, considerably higher drug concentrations were found in infected sites than in non-infected sites at 5-24 h after dosing (0.38-0.44 mg/c compared with 0.07-0.14 mg/L of bulla wash; 1.01-1.75 micrograms compared with < or = 0.01-0.03 microgram at the disc site; 1.72-5.28 mg/kg compared with 0.7-1.53 mg/kg of lung). When the observation periods were extended to include 48, 56 or 96 h after dosing, the ratio of azithromycin infection site concentration: serum concentration steadily increased with time in all model systems (middle ear, implanted disc and pneumonia), reflecting the maintenance of concentrations at the sites of infection, while serum concentrations declined. Bioassay of cell pellets and supernatants, obtained from pooled bulla washes of gerbils treated with azithromycin during a period of inflammation, revealed that cellular components accounted for about 75% of the azithromycin detected. These data show that increased azithromycin concentrations occur at sites of localized infection. This correlates with the presence of inflammation and is associated with the cellular components of the inflammatory response. Therefore, phagocytes may be important vehicles for delivering azithromycin to and sustaining azithromycin concentrations at sites of infection.
TI  - Assembly of human contact phase proteins and release of bradykinin at the surface of curli-expressing Escherichia coli.
AB  - Previous work has demonstrated that most strains of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes bind kininogens through M protein, a fibrous surface protein and virulence determinant. Here we find that strains of several other pathogenic bacterial species, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, isolated from patients with sepsis, also bind kininogens, especially kininogen (HK). The most pronounced interaction was seen between HK and Escherichia coli. Among clinical isolates of E. coli, the majority of the enterohaemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, and sepsis strains, but none of the enteroinvasive and enteropathogenic strains, bound HK. Binding of HK to E. coli correlated with the expression of curli, another fibrous bacterial surface protein, and the binding of HK to purified curli was specific, saturable, and of high affinity; Ka = 9 x 10(7) M-1. Other contact phase proteins such as factor XI, factor XII, and prekallikrein bound to curliated E. coli, but not to an isogenic curli-deficient mutant strain, suggesting that contact phase activation may occur at the surface of curliated bacteria. Kininogens are also precursor molecules of the vasoactive kinins. When incubated with human plasma, curli-expressing bacteria absorbed HK. Addition of purified plasma kallikrein to the HK-loaded bacteria resulted in a rapid and efficient release of bradykinin from surface-bound HK. The assembly of contact phase factors at the surface of pathogenic bacteria and the release of the potent proinflammatory and vasoactive peptide bradykinin, should have a major impact on the host-microbe relationship and may contribute to bacterial pathogenicity and virulence.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir against respiratory pathogens isolated in Sicily with reference to beta-lactamase production.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir (CI-983, FK-482), an orally absorbed aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was evaluated against all 287 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes in comparison with cefaclor, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erythromycin and cotrimoxazole. The bactericidal activity of cefdinir, cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and erythromycin was determined against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae. With the exception of one beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant strain of H. influenzae (resistant to all antibiotics tested), no resistance to cefdinir was observed (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). Cefdinir was active against H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and M. catarrhalis regardless of whether or not they produced beta-lactamase. In general, the inhibitory concentrations of cefdinir against H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and M. catarrhalis were similar to those of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, one or two dilutions lower than those of cefuroxime and four dilutions lower than those of cefaclor and cotrimoxazole. Against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes cefdinir had the same activity as cefuroxime and amoxicillin but was more effective than the other antibiotics tested. Kinetic studies showed that cefdinir was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations 2 and 4 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): a reduction of 99.9% in CFU values was generally observed after 6-8 h.
TI  - Brodimoprim: effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations on virulence traits  of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, and on plasmid transfer and stability.
AB  - The effects of brodimoprim, a new trimethoprim analogue, on several virulence traits of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens exposed to sub-lethal levels of the drug was studied. Adherence to tracheal epithelial cells was inhibited by brodimoprim in Klebsiella pneumoniae (41-67% reduction), Moraxella catarrhalis (87-90%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0-53%), while in Streptococcus pneumoniae binding was unaffected. With buccal epithelial cells the comparison between treated and control bacteria indicated statistically significant reduction in adherence with both S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae, (P < 0.015). With M.catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes only marginal changes were detected (P > 0.05). Exoenzyme and capsule production were assessed in at least three isolates of diverse respiratory pathogens grown in the presence of sub-lethal levels of the new agent. The drug affected protease and beta-hemolysin (alpha-toxin) production in both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant S.aureus. On the contrary, synthesis of lipase, DNase, coagulase, and beta-lactamase (S.aureus), pneumolysin (S.pneumoniae), streptolysin S, DNase, and protease (S.pyogenes), capsule (K.pneumoniae, H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae), and beta-lactamase (K.pneumoniae, H.influenzae and M.catarrhalis) were not inhibited by subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of the drug. Finally, motility was blocked in urinary pathogens E.coli, P.mirabilis and P.aeruginosa, while in this latter microorganism pigment production was also affected. High molecular weight low-copy F'lac, and low molecular weight high-copy pHSG298 plasmids were eliminated from E.coli treated with sub-MIC concentrations of brodimoprim. The incidence and cured cells ranged from 9% for F'lac to 23% for pHSG298. F'lac transfer was also inhibited by the drug. When conjugation was carried out with bacteria exposed to brodimoprim (5XMIC), a reduction (50%) in the number of recombinants was noted in comparison to the control. The fact that brodimoprim interferes with the expression of some virulence traits, in particular with adherence, at sub-MIC levels may assist the drug in eradicating respiratory pathogens from the epithelial lining, thus diminishing the probability of reinfection.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiology of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - Chronic sinusitis is one of the most common diseases treated in outpatient centres. In this prospective study, 49 patients with the diagnosis of chronic maxillary sinusitis were evaluated microbiologically by using sinus swab, irrigation fluid and sinus mucosal tissue specimens obtained during endoscopic sinus surgery. There was no bacterial growth in seven cases. In the remaining 42 cases a total of 89 bacteria were isolated, 28 of them being classical pathogens and 61 being non-classical pathogens. Among the classical pathogens Staphylococcus aureus was the most common one. The correlation between the isolates obtained from maxillary sinus and isolates obtained from throat, nose and nasopharynx did not have a predictive value. Since the overall rate of classical pathogen isolation from patients with chronic sinusitis was not significantly high, the possible role of factors other than bacterial growth should be identified in the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis.

TI  - Epidemiology and control of acute respiratory diseases with emphasis on group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus: a decade of U.S. Army experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the experiences of the U.S. Army regarding prevention and control, and frequencies, rates, trends, and determinants of febrile acute respiratory diseases (ARDs), particularly Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). METHODOLOGY: Since 1966, the U.S. Army has conducted routine surveillance of ARDs among basic trainees. Since 1985, all trainees with fever and respiratory tract symptoms have been cultured for GABHS: Field investigations were conducted when outbreaks of acute respiratory or GABHS-associated illnesses were detected. Mass plus tandem benzathine penicillin prophylaxis were used to interdict and control training center GABHS outbreaks. RESULTS: During the period 1985 to 1994, there were 65,184 hospitalizations for acute febrile respiratory illnesses among Army trainees. The crude hospitalization rate was 0.45 per 100 trainees per week. The rate consistently declined over the period. Incremental declines were temporally associated with increased use of adenovirus immunizations and broader use of benzathine penicillin prophylaxis. During the period, 10,789 of 59,818 (18%) pharyngeal cultures were positive for GABHS: GABHS outbreaks were associated with diverse clinical manifestations including streptococcal toxic shock, acute rheumatic fever, and pneumonia. The emergence of mucoid colony morphology in clinical isolates was a consistent indicator of circulating virulent strains with epidemic potential. Outbreak-associated M types were M1, M3, M5, and M18. In response to six GABHS outbreaks, mass plus tandem benzathine penicillin chemoprophylaxis produced rapid and sustained GABHS control. ARD and GABHS recovery rates were lowest when benzathine penicillin prophylaxis was widely used. CONCLUSIONS: ARD rates among Army trainees have consistently declined to unprecedented levels. GABHS has reemerged as an important threat to military trainees. Benzathine penicillin chemoprophylaxis is safe and effective for interdicting and preventing GABHS outbreaks in closed, healthy young adult populations.
TI  - Acute pharyngitis: etiology and diagnosis.
AB  
TI  - Susceptibility surveillance of U.S. respiratory pathogen isolates to newer macrolide and azalide antibiotics.
AB  - Azithromycin and clarithromycin are both highly active in vitro against Gram-positive respiratory pathogens, but azithromycin is substantially more potent against Haemophilus influenzae. We investigated the susceptibility of H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes to azithromycin and clarithromycin, and determined the prevalence of beta-lactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Results from three geographic regions of the USA were compared. A significantly greater proportion of H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to azithromycin than to clarithromycin (95.7% vs 63.1%, P < 0.001). M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were highly susceptible to both antibiotics with no significant differences in susceptibility. beta-Lactamase was produced by 94.8% of M. catarrhalis isolates and 35.6% of H. influenzae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of clarithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of clarithromycin (CAM), a new  oral macrolide antibiotic, were compared with those of erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM) and rokitamycin (RKM). The antibacterial spectrum and in vitro activities of CAM were similar to those of EM. Therapeutic efficacies of CAM against various experimental infections in mice--including systemic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and subcutaneous abscess due to S. aureus, and bacterial pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae--were superior to those of EM, JM and RKM. CAM exhibited higher serum levels than EM in mice after a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. The in vitro activity of CS-940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. In particular, CS-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the MIC at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CS-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. The activity of CS-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. CS-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa, CS-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. Against experimental pneumonia with K. pneumoniae in mice, CS-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. These results suggest that CS-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - [Efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil in the treatment of acute otitis media due to benzylpenicillin-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  - Clinical and bacteriological studies were carried out on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI) granule in infantile purulent acute otitis media treated at general practice settings and the following findings were obtained: 1. Two hundred forty eight strains were isolated from 210 patients, almost all of which (81.1%) harbored the following two strains: Streptococcus pneumoniae (42.3%) and Haemophilus influenzae (38.8%). Among S. pneumoniae, benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae, (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was 36.2%, corresponding to 15.3% of all the isolates and found in 18% of all patients. 2. The bacteria in the middle ear discharge and the nasopharyngeal swabs were correlated with conformity rate of more than 80% with regard to Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae but no Staphylococcus aureus was detected simultaneously from the two sources in any of the patients. S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were considered to be contaminants that were originated from the external auditory meatus at the time of sampling. 3. Frequencies of isolation of S. pneumoniae from different age groups were higher in a lower age group between 0 and 4 years and those of PISP or PRSP had the similar tendency. 4. Antibacterial activities were determined for CDTR and related oral antibiotics against the strains of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae as representative isolates. CDTR had stronger antibacterial activities against both bacteria than the reference antibiotics. CDTR was found to be transferred into the otorrhea at a mean concentration of 0.58 micrograms/ml after single administration of CDTR-PI granule formulation at 3 mg(potency)/kg. 5. As for bacterial eradication efficacies in the middle ear cavity and the nasopharynx, eradication rates were higher than 80% in the middle ear cavity in all cases without large differences among bacterial species but eradication rate of PISP was 30% in the nasopharynx, and it was significantly lower than those of PSSP and other bacteria. 6. In view of clinical effectiveness, the efficacy rate was 89.4% and bacteriological effects was 92.2%; in view of safety, adverse reactions were; observed in 9.5% and the rate of usefulness was 89.4%. 7. From above-stated results, CDTR-PI was considered as a useful oral antibiotic for infantile acute otitis media including PISP infections.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (UP-PCR) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. A universal protocol of preparation of PCR samples from cultures representing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. The bands of UP-PCR products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. The applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the DNA bands obtained for different strains. Three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis produced very similar DNA banding patterns. They comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. The DNA profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. The method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of CP-99219, a new quinolone, against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The comparative in-vitro activity of CP-99219, a new quinolone, against Haemophilus influenzae (150 isolates), Moraxella catarrhalis (100), Streptococcus pneumoniae (80) and Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (40) was determined using an agar dilution technique. CP-99219 was the most active compound tested against M. catarrhalis (MIC50 = 0.015 mg/L, MIC90 = 0.03 mg/L). Ceftriaxone, CP-99219 and ciprofloxacin were the three most active agents tested against H.influenzae. CP-99219 showed good activity, 16-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin, against S.pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L; MIC90 = 0.25 mg/L) and was also active against Group A streptococci. Clinical studies regarding the use of CP-99219 in respiratory tract infections seem indicated.
TI  - Cefpodoxime proxetil suspension compared with cefaclor suspension for treatment of acute otitis media in paediatric patients.
AB  - A multicentre open-label, randomised trial was performed to compare the efficacy  and safety of cefpodoxime proxetil bd and cefaclor tds in the treatment of acute otitis media in children. A total of 167 children aged from 1 month to 11 years were enrolled in five centres: 78 treated with cefpodoxime and 83 treated with cefaclor, were evaluated in the ITT analysis. After tympanocentesis and culture of middle ear fluid, a pathogen was isolated from 85 (53%) of the 161 evaluable patients for the ITT analysis. The organisms isolated were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae: (n = 33, 37.5%); Haemophilus influenzae: (n = 22, 25%); Staphylococcus aureus: (n = 15, 17.1%); Streptococcus pyogenes: (n = 8, 9.1%); Moraxella catarrhalis: (n = 2, 2.3%); others (n = 6, 6.8%). Success (defined as a satisfactory clinical outcome, either cure or improvement) was achieved at the end of treatment, in 93.6% of ther patients in the cefpodoxime group and 91.6% of the patients in the cefaclor group (P> 0.05). Clinical recurrence was identified at the follow-up visit (30 days after inclusion), in 6.4% of the cefpodoxime-treated patients and 7.2% of the cefaclor-treated patients (P> 0.05). The drugs were well tolerated by 78/79 (99%) of patients in the cefpodoxime-treated group and 80/85 (94%) in the cefaclor-treated group. The incidence of adverse effects was higher in the cefaclor group than in the cefpodoxime group, but this was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). IN conclusion, cefpodaxime proxetil administered bd is as effective as cefaclor administered tds in the treatment of acute otitis media in children. The less frequent dosing schedule of cefpodoxime (bd) compared with cefaclor (tds) appears to be more convenient for the treatment of the infections in children.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Bactericidal activity, morphological alterations, and synergistic interactions of rufloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with its N-desmethylate D derivative (MF 922).
AB  - The in vitro activity of rufloxacin, alone and in combination with its metabolite (MF 922) against common respiratory and urinary tract pathogens and anaerobes was assessed. No synergistic interaction between rufloxacin and MF 922 was observed by the checkerboard technique against aerobic bacteria. When the time-kill system was employed, 24 synergistic interactions were noted out of 30 tests performed (80%), of which 14 (100%) were with Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 2 with Moraxella catarrhalis (50%), 4 with Haemophilus influenzae (100%), 2 with Staphylococcus aureus (50%) and 2 with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (50%). Synergism was found with all Bacteroides fragilis irrespectively of the method used. Rufloxacin alone or in combination with MF 922, at concentrations achieved in vivo, induced morphological alterations in all the pathogens analyzed with the exception of M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Towards S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, the same levels of rufloxacin and MF 922 were capable of inducing only bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effect, followed by reversible morphological modifications. The presence of 50% human serum in the test media did not affect the results.
TI  - [On adenoidectomy].
AB  - The paper deals on the advantages for the rhinopharynx following adenoidectomy. The AA. explain their procedure for its removal under visual control. Both a radiological and microbiological study was done in 90 children waiting for the removal with the aim of realizing the changes derived to the upper air-way. The surgery enhances the adenoidal expression and significatively improves the rhinopharyngeal air-way (p < 0.001). Furthermore the pathogenic flora of epipharynx changes for benefit of the saprophytic flora (p < 0.001). The adenoidectomy is indicated when the adenoidal mass hinder the nasopharyngeal breathing, when causes adenoid outbreaks and also in those cases of stubborn secretory otitis not yielding to conservative treatment.
TI  - [Stimulation of synthesis of secretory immunoglobulin A in the lung by oral immunization: an approach with therapeutic relevance?].
AB  - Due to its strategic position on mucosal surfaces secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) is one of the first protective factors of the specific immune system against invading pathogens. As a factor of acquired immunity, the synthesis of sIgA can be modulated by various immunization strategies. Our experiments aimed at the enhancement of the sIgA pool in the lungs by oral immunization. As reported previously, commercially available LW 50020, an immunomodulator consisting of lysates of seven common pneumotropic pathogens, is effective in inducing significant IgA antibody responses in the lungs following oral immunization [1]. In the present study we developed new strategies to enhance this effect by encapsulating LW 50020 into microspheres and liposomes. Microspheres and liposomes with entrapped immunomodulator each enhanced the effect of soluble LW 50020 by about 45% and 90%, respectively. In addition, microsphere based immunization induced a significantly increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) response in the lungs. In further experiments we demonstrated that a similar effect could be achieved by administration of a high molecular weight conjugate of lipopolysaccharide from Klebsiella pneumoniae (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes (LTA). This conjugate enhanced the synthesis of IgA in the lungs by 45% and, furthermore, induced a significantly enhanced IgG response in the lungs, without any obvious toxic or pyrogenic side effects. This new conjugate possibly offers an opportunity to replace the complex immunomodulator LW 50020 by a less complex vaccine.
TI  - Molecular population genetic analysis of emerged bacterial pathogens: selected insights.
AB  - Research in bacterial population genetics has increased in the last 10 years. Population genetic theory and tools and related strategies have been used to investigate bacterial pathogens that have contributed to recent episodes of temporal variation in disease frequency and severity. A common theme demonstrated by these analyses is that distinct bacterial clones are responsible for disease outbreaks and increases in infection frequency. Many of these clones are characterized by unique combinations of virulence genes or alleles of virulence genes. Because substantial interclonal variance exists in relative virulence, molecular population genetic studies have led to the concept that the unit of bacterial pathogenicity is the clone or cell line. Continued new insights into host parasite interactions at the molecular level will be achieved by combining clonal analysis of bacterial pathogens with large-scale comparative sequencing of virulence genes.
TI  - Incidence, aetiology, and prognosis of acute epiglottitis in children and adults  in Sweden.
AB  - A retrospective study of the incidence, aetiology and case fatality rate of acute epiglottitis in children and adults was performed. The study covered the whole of Sweden (population 8.4 million) during the years 1987-89, before general vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) type b was started. Patients were included if it was documented that they fulfilled all 3 of the following criteria: (a) red and swollen epiglottis visualized by indirect laryngoscopy, (b) inspiratory stridor or difficulties in swallowing, and (c) a temperature > or = 38 degrees C. A total of 306 children and adolescents (0-19 years) and 502 adults (> or = 20 years) were found. The age-specific incidence was highest in children aged 0-4 years, (14.7/100,000 per year). The total incidence was 3.2/100,000 per year. In the age group 0-19 years, blood cultures had been obtained from 195 (64%) and Hi was isolated from 154 (79%). In adults (> or = 20 years), 114 of 298 blood cultures yielded Hi, while pneumococci were isolated from 5 and group A streptococci from 3 patients. A total of 220 children (72%) and 114 adults (23%) needed an artificial airway. Five children and 12 adults died. In conclusion, the incidence of acute epiglottis in Sweden is very high. Compared to a previous country-wide study covering the years 1981-83 that used the same methods for case finding and case definition, the incidence in children had decreased while the incidence in adults had increased.
TI  - [The differentiation of the antigens making up the circulating immune complexes].
AB  - A simple method for the detection and analysis of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in specimens of biological fluids is proposed. The method was approved in the examination of patients with chronic infections caused by mycoplasmas and Streptococcus pyogenes L-forms. The method made it possible to diagnose infectious diseases accompanied by the formation of immune complexes and to study the dynamics of the processes of the accumulation and elimination of CIC in the course of the disease. Thus, the detection rate of specific antigens (Ag) incorporated into CIC in patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia exceeded 90 %. In children aged up to 1 year this rate decreased to 40 %. The diagnostic value of the determination of specific Ag incorporated into CIC was shown in streptococcal infections caused by S.pyogenes L-forms, viz. in frequently relapsing erysipelas, as well as in subacute rheumatism and in infectious allergic myocarditis.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - The nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in children with otitis media with effusion.
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of nasopharyngeal alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, as a defense mechanism of the normal bacterial flora against infection. Cultures were taken from the nasopharynges of 43 children with otitis media with effusion (OME). The detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococus aureus and group A streptococci were significantly lower in the nasopharynx than those isolated from the tonsils of the same patients. Moreover, the detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against all of these pathogens derived from the nasopharynx were lower than those in healthy children, streptococcal strains with activity against H. influenzae and Strep, pneumoniae were also lower than that in patients with tonsillitis. These findings suggest that low nasopharyngeal levels of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against respiratory pathogens may render children susceptible to OME. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationships between the prevalence of pathogens in the nasopharynx and the inhibitory activities of alpha-streptococci against them in order to devise and select optimal treatment for patients with OME.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Etiology of acute otitis media in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common infections that are implicated as significant contributors to morbidity in HIV-infected children. To establish the optimal antibiotic therapy tympanocentesis is indicated as the first line diagnostic procedure, because unusual pathogens may play a role in advanced stages of deficient humoral or cellular immunity. METHODS: The microbiology of 60 episodes of AOM diagnosed in 21 symptomatic HIV-infected children (ages 9 months to 12 years) was compared with that of 121 episodes of AOM occurring in 113 immunocompetent HIV-negative children (ages 6 months to 12 years) in the last 5 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of the three most common pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) was similar in HIV-infected and in normal children (56.5% vs. 54.9% of the ears). Staphylococcus aureus was significantly more frequent in AOM diagnosed in severely immunosuppressed stages. A significantly lower proportion of middle ear effusions obtained in HIV-infected children yielded no bacteria compared with normal children. Beta-lactamase production among isolates of H. influenzae was a rare phenomenon, both in HIV-infected and in normal children. No penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was found. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected children with absent or moderate immunosuppression empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the recommendations given for immunocompetent children of the same geographic area. In severe immunosuppressed stages, given the possible role of Staph. aureus, extended spectrum antibiotics should be considered.
TI  - Antibacterial and immunostimulating casein-derived substances from milk: casecidin, isracidin peptides.
AB  - Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified with casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of alpha s1-casein. This product consisted of the N -terminal segment (1-23) of alpha s1-casein B, named "isracidin", and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on a large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.
TI  - Macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from Taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital. The results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most of the tested bacteria. The MIC90s for Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. The MIC50s for methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. For S. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and B. fragilis, the MIC50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. The resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. Around 55% of S. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of S. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.
TI  - [Various new pathogens in pneumonia].
AB  - The table summarizes the many newly recognized agents causing lower respiratory tract infections: gram + cocci, Streptococcus agalactiae, enterococci; gram-rods, acinetobacter, Aeromonas hydrophila, Eikenella corrodens; Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to multiple drugs, intracellular organisms and viruses. Some details are given in four chapters: Pneumococci resistant to penicillin G which must be detected and impose new therapeutic strategies; Chlamydia pneumoniae with its difficulties for the diagnosis and the absence of standardized therapeutic trials; Streptococcus pyogenes with a recrudescence of severe and invasive infections, TSS and virulence factors; the pulmonary Hantavirus syndrome with 105 patients recognized (mortality 52%) in the USA and Canada, the homeland of the deermouse (Peromiscus maniculatus).
TI  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae as a cofactor in severe respiratory infections.
AB  - We report the clinical events associated with severe bacterial or viral infections in four patients whose illnesses followed or coincided with acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory infection. We propose that M. pneumoniae has the ability to act as a cofactor in severe respiratory disease by facilitating alterations in local respiratory immunity or structure and function.
TI  - Antibiotics and bacterial resistance. A few elements of genetic basis for this relationship.
AB  - In the preantibiotic era, many people died of bacterial infections caused by such pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antibiotics have reduced the mortality from infectious diseases but not the prevalence of these diseases. It was not long after the clinical introduction of the first antibiotics in the 1950s that the first reports of bacterial resistance began to appear. Use, and often abuse or misuse, of antimicrobial agents has encouraged the evolution of bacteria toward resistance, resulting often in therapeutic failure. In the beginning, new antibiotics have always appeared in plenty of time to provide new cures for diseases caused by resistant bacterial pathogens. Also, some clinically important groups of bacteria showed no signs of major increases in resistance. For example, S. pneumoniae strains remained susceptible to penicillin long after other bacteria had become resistant to it. Recent developments of bacteria resistance to antibiotics are indeed disquieting.
TI  - In vivo therapeutic efficacies of PD 138312 and PD 140248, two novel fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are novel broad-spectrum 7-pyrrolidinyl fluoronaphthyridines with a cyclopropyl or a difluorophenyl substitution at the 1 positions, respectively. They have been demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms. These compounds were evaluated for their in vivo potencies against acute systemic infections in mice and in a mouse pneumococcal pneumonia model. They were very effective by both the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration. Most remarkable were their comparative median protective values against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. In general, these compounds were 28- to 100-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against these clinically significant organisms when the drugs were given orally and 10- to 38-fold more active when the drugs were given parenterally. Average ratios of drug concentrations in mice after drug administration by the oral route to that after administration by the subcutaneous route indicate 34 to 44% greater bioavailabilities of PD 138312 and PD 140248 compared with that of ciprofloxacin. In a multidose pneumococcal mouse pneumonia model these new quinolones were extremely effective, with median curative doses of 2 to 2.8 mg/kg of body weight per dose. Ciprofloxacin was ineffective (median curative dose, >100 mg/kg per dose) in this model. Comparative pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed a relative superiority of PD 140248. Peak levels of PD 140248 in blood after the administration of a single oral 50-mg/kg dose were twice those of PD 138312 and ciprofloxacin, with PD 140248 having a substantially longer half-life. These results indicate that PD 138312 and PD 140248 have excellent therapeutic potential against clinically important gram-positive pathogens when the drugs are administered both orally and parenterally.
TI  - Clinical utility of blood cultures in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia without defined underlying risks.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively examined the clinical utility of obtaining routine blood cultures before the administration of antibiotics in certain nonimmunosuppressed patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to the hospital during 1991. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Grady Memorial Hospital (a county hospital primarily serving inner-city Atlanta). PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Hospital discharge diagnosis listings identified 1,250 adults ( > or = 18 years old) with pneumonia. From this group of patients, we selected patients admitted to the hospital with (1) respiratory symptoms and a lobar infiltrate on chest radiograph that were present at the time of hospital admission, (2) two or more sets of blood cultures obtained within 48 h of hospital admission, and (3) absence of defined risk factors: HIV-related illness, malignancy, recent chemotherapy, steroid therapy, sickle cell disease, nursing home residence, or hospital stays within the past 14 days. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Five hundred seventeen patients (mean age, 52 years;: age range, 18 to 103 years) qualified. Of these 517 patients, 25 patients (4.8%) had growth in blood cultures considered contaminants while 34 (6.6%) had blood cultures positive for the following pathogens: 29 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 Escherichia coli. Antibiotic therapy was changed for 7 of the 34 patients with positive blood cultures (1.4% of study patients). Antibiotic regimens were altered in 48 additional patients based on sputum culture, poor clinical response, and allergic reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Few blood cultures were positive for likely infecting organisms in adult patients with CAP without defined underlying risk factors. Furthermore, a total of $34,122 was spent on blood cultures at $66 per patient. In this carefully defined group of patients, blood cultures may have limited clinical utility and questionable cost-effectiveness.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of three acid-stable azalide compounds, L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 compared to erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin.
AB  - L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 are novel azalide derivatives of erythromycin  that exhibit improved acid stability over erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin. The half-life in aqueous solution at pH = 2.1 of these compounds ranged from 0.3 hour for erythromycin to 16.2 hours for L-708,299. The rank order of half-life in acid solution from most to least stable was L-708,299 > L-701,677 > L-708,365 > azithromycin = clarithromycin > erythromycin. In a disseminated Streptococcus pyogenes mouse infection model, azithromycin and L-708,365 were slightly more efficacious than clarithromycin, L-701,677 and L-708,299; all 5 compounds being more active than erythromycin. In a Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary challenge mouse model, azithromycin, L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 were all equal in efficacy and at least four-fold more active than clarithromycin and erythromycin. Clarithromycin, L-708,365 and interestingly erythromycin, showed greater bacterial clearance than azithromycin, L-701,677 and L-708,299 in a localized infection model that measured clearance of Staphylococcus aureus from mouse thigh tissues. Our results indicate that L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 exhibit improved acid stability and were at least equally efficacious as presently marketed macrolide/azalide antibiotics.
TI  - [Participation in causing O.M.E. with nasopharyngeal alpha-Streptococcus].
AB  - The role of normal pharyngeal flora in the defense mechanism against infections in the upper respiratory tract was studied in 50 children with otitis media with effusion (O.M.E.). In the bacteriological study of the nasopharynx, the incidence of H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, M. catarrhalis and group A Streptococcus was about 46%, 24%, 20%, 12% and 8%, respectively. The incidence of these species in the cases with O.M.E. was higher than that in the cases with chronic tonsilitis or control cases. In 41 O.M.E. cases with alpha-streptococci (82%), the incidence of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against 5 pathogens (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, M. catarrhalis, group A Streptococcus) was examined. The detection rate of alpha-streptococcal strains with inhibitory activity against 5 pathogens derived from the nasopharynx in the cases with O.M.E. was significantly lower than that of the strain in the chronic tonsilitis cases and the control cases. Moreover, the detection rate of inhibitory alpha-streptococci from the nasopharynx was lower than that of from the tonsil. These findings suggest that the decline of inhibitory activity against pathogens by normal flora in nasopharynx is one of the factors causing O.M.E.
TI  - Antimicrobial prophylaxis of infection.
AB  - Antimicrobial agents are used to prevent infections in a variety of clinical circumstances. In certain instances, the precise indications for prophylaxis remain controversial, and the preferred regimens undergo alterations based upon evolving clinical experience, changing patterns of microbial susceptibility, and innovations in medical and surgical practice. This article outlines the general principles underlying the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and presents recommendations for the use of such prophylaxis in three areas: (1) surgery involving contaminated, clean-contaminated, and clean procedures; (2) prevention of infections due to specific pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes; and (3) prevention of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Construction of a Streptococcus pyogenes recA mutant via insertional inactivation, and cloning and sequencing of the complete recA gene.
AB  - To facilitate future genetic studies with Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp), a recA mutant (Rec11) was constructed using a streptococcal integration vector carrying a PCR-derived internal recA fragment. The insertion of the plasmid in the mutant chromosome was identified by Southern hybridization. Resistance to UV and the ability to accept linear DNA transformation by Rec11 were greatly decreased, confirming its RecA phenotype. Using the PCR-derived fragment as a probe, we cloned and sequenced the complete Sp recA gene, which is highly homologous to the recA of S. pneumoniae and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of ceftibuten on respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of ceftibuten, a novel beta-lactamase-stable cephem, was determined for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The ceftibuten PAE after a 2-hour exposure to 2 micrograms/ml (4 x minimum inhibitory concentration) for S. pyogenes was 2.7 to > 10 hours. The PAE for S. pneumoniae after a 2-hour exposure to 15 micrograms/ml, concentrations that are achieved in man after usual therapeutic doses, was 1.1 to 3.4 hours and the PAE for H. influenzae was 1 to 1.1 hours. M. catarrhalis had a PAE of 1.5 to 1.8 hours after exposure to 15 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. The ceftibuten PAE was not affected by serum. The ceftibuten PAE was prolonged by exposure to a sub-minimum inhibitory concentration concentration of ceftibuten as would occur in the clinical situation. The PAE of ceftibuten was not affected by the copresence of erythromycin as would occur when treating infections in which atypical organisms are suspected. There was no correlation between bacterial reduction in colony-forming units and the duration of PAE. A level of 6 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten had a similar bacterial killing activity compared with a 6-hour exposure to 15 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. This study suggests that ceftibuten can be administered orally, once daily in an adult dose of 400 mg or a pediatric dose of 9 mg/kg, to treat respiratory infections caused by the most common pathogens.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil against community-acquired respiratory tract infections].
AB  - We investigated clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil (CEMT-PI) in community-acquired respiratory tract infections and obtained the following findings. 1. Of the 420 respiratory tract infection cases that were treated with CEMT-PI according to a same protocol at a total of 42 institutions in Tokyo, Kanagawa-ken, Saitama-ken and Chiba-ken from February to the beginning of April 1994, 359 cases in which clinical evaluations were considered possible were selected as the subjects of the clinical study. Regarding genders of patients, slightly more females (56.3%) than males were included. Diagnoses given to these patients included laryngopharygealitis (60.7%), tonsillitis (14.2%) and acute bronchitis (13.6). Outpatients accounted for 94.4% of the subjects. 2. For the bacteriological study, a written material describing the method of collecting specimens, storage and transport in detail was distributed to the above mentioned institutions. The isolation and identification of suspected causative bacteria, determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and investigation of beta-lactamase production were conducted all together. Suspected causative bacteria were detected from 238 (66.3%) out of the 359 cases. They included 85 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 76 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 20 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 17 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis. 3. Clinical efficacy rates (the ratio of those excellent+good) among those who were treated with 1 CEMT-PI tablet (194 mg, titer) twice a day was 76.5% and among those who were given 2 tablets twice a day was 87.4%. The improvement rate of the latter was higher at a significant level of P < 0.05. 4. The clinical efficacies classified by suspected causative bacteria (single bacterium) were 93.3% against M.(B.) catarrhalis, 91.7% against beta-streptococci, 87.1% against H. influenzae and 78.4% against S. pneumoniae, etc. Though 7 (9.2%) of the 76 strains of S. pneumoniae were benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), the bacteriological efficacy was assessed either excellent or good in all of the 7 patients from whom PISP were detected. The clinical efficacy was assessed 100.0% in those from which a plural number of bacteria were detected. The 13 cases from which small numbers of Staphylococcus aureus was detected with other bacterium were also included in these cases.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Third generation oral cephalosporins: comparative in vitro kinetics.
AB  - In order to provide additional data on the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefetamet-pivoxil against respiratory pathogens, we determined the bactericidal kinetics of this antibiotic in comparison to cefixime and ceftibuten against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. time-kill studies were performed by using concentrations equal to a x MIC, and 4 x MIC of the antibiotics tested and different inocula (10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) CFU/ml). The strains were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees C and 1 ml samples were removed at regular intervals for viable count determination. The antibiotics were eliminated by serial ten-fold dilutions in physiological saline before plating. At 4 x MIC of cefetamet and at 10(5) CFU/ml inoculum the results were 99.9% killing or more of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis at 4 h, and of E. coli and K. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h, and of E. coli and K. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h. At the same concentration of MIC and with the same inoculum a 99.9% reduction was achieved against S. pneumoniae within 4 h and against S. pyogenes within 2 h with no regrowth at 24 h in both cases. Similar results were obtained using 10(7) and 10(9) CFU/ml inocula. Cefetamet had efficient killing activity even at lower concentrations. Bactericidal kinetics of cefetamet favorably compare with those of cefixime and ceftibuten. The efficient bactericidal activity of cefetamet-pivoxil indicates a clinical role for this new oral cephalosporin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia in a patient with sickle cell anemia on penicillin prophylaxis.
AB  - Serious invasive bacterial infections, particularly those due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, are a well-known complication in patients with sickle cell disease. Early penicillin prophylaxis has been shown to prevent these infections and also to improve survival. This article describes a child with sickle cell anemia who, while on penicillin prophylaxis, developed a group A streptococcal bacteremia, a pathogen not commonly associated with bacteremia in sickle cell disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy issues facing pediatricians.
AB  - In the field of infectious diseases, the emergence of new pathogens or old diseases in newly recognized forms; changing virulence of pathogens; changing patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility; new diagnostic techniques, drugs or vaccines; changing concepts of chemoprophylaxis; controversies about medical vs. surgical techniques; and the challenge of care of children with infectious diseases within new guidelines of managed care are recently identified areas of change. The increased resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to many commonly used antimicrobials and the increased proportion of beta-lactamase-producing nontypable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis concern many practitioners. The decreased antibiotic susceptibility of S. pneumoniae is a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. Optimal therapy for mild, moderate or severe pneumococcal disease is dependent on current local susceptibility patterns. Group A streptococci are uniformly susceptible to readily achieved concentrations of all penicillins and cephalosporins. However, recent clusters of cases of rheumatic fever, increased recognition of toxic shock syndrome and bacteremic and localized severe pneumococcal disease have increased concern about the changing ecology of the Streptococcus and the implications for therapy. Finally recognition that many children with acute bacterial otitis media have resolution of disease without use of antimicrobial agents has led to more rigorous study designs for evaluating new drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - Breakdown of the round window membrane permeability barrier evoked by streptolysin O: possible etiologic role in development of sensorineural hearing loss in acute otitis media.
AB  - Sensorineural hearing loss is a common sequela of acute and chronic otitis media, and the round window membrane (RWM) is currently being considered as a major route for noxious agents to pass from the middle ear cavity to the cochlea. Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major causative agent of otitis media, and Streptococcus pyogenes A produce molecularly related toxins, pneumolysin and streptolysin O (SLO), that form large pores in target membranes. In this study, we analyzed the effects of SLO on the permeability of the RWM. Resected RWMs from a total of 104 guinea pigs were embedded between two chambers of an in vitro system. One chamber was designated as the tympanal (cis) compartment, and the other was designated as the inner ear (trans) compartment. The permeability of normal and SLO-damaged RWMs towards Na+, [14C]mannitol, and proteins was investigated. SLO evoked permeability defects dose dependently in the RWM with fluxes of both Na+ and [14C]mannitol being demonstrable over a time span of up to 8 h. Serum proteins and radioiodinated SLO were also shown to pass through the damage RWM. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the morphological correlates to these results. We propose that damage to the RWM by potent pore-forming cytolysins leads to leakage of ions from the perilymph. Ionic disequilibrium and passage of noxious macromolecules to the cochlea could contribute to disturbances of the inner ear function.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - [The effect of cefaclor and cefixime on nasopharyngeal pathogens in children].
AB  - Changes in nasopharyngeal flora were investigated in children with acute otitis media and with acute exacerbations of chronic sinusitis in whom antibiotic therapy of relatively long duration was required until substantial improvement in clinical findings was achieved. 1. The antibiotics used were two cephalosporins, i.e., cefaclor (CCL) and cefixime (CFIX), administered to 18 patients each for 1 week and to 26 and 20 patients, respectively, for 2 weeks. Bacteriologic examination of the nasopharyngeal mucosa was performed at the first visit and at 1 week in those who underwent antibiotic therapy for 1 week, and at the first visit and at 1 and 2 weeks in those treated with antibiotics for 2 weeks. 2. The elimination rates for the infecting microorganisms in the patients in the CCL-treated group were 30% for Haemophilus influenzae, 83% for Staphylococcus aureus, 100% for Streptococcus pyogenes and 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae at 1 week, and 18% for H. influenzae, 100% for S. aureus and 100% for S. pyogenes at 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Replacement of S. aureus and S. pyogenes by H. influenzae was observed. 3. The elimination rates for infecting bacteria in the patients in the CFIX-treated groups were 61% for H. influenzae, 50% for S. aureus, 75% for S. pyogenes, 80% for S. pneumoniae and 100% for Moraxella catarrhalis at 1 week, and 72% for H. influenzae, 0% for S. aureus, 100% for S. pyogenes, and 0% for S. pneumoniae at 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The elimination rate for H. influenzae at 2 weeks was significantly higher than the corresponding value for the CCL-treated group. Replacement of H. influenzae by S. aureus and S. pneumoniae and of S. pyogenes by S. aureus was detected. 4. There was one patient with acute otitis media in the CFIX-treated group in whom a clinical relapse occurred due to H. influenzae persisters in the nasopharynx. Thus the diagnosis in this patient was so-called "recurrent otitis media". 5. H. influenzae tended to persist after exposure to therapeutically adequate concentrations of CCL, as did S. aureus and S. pneumoniae following treatment with CFIX. Thus, it would seem that ample heed must be given to persistence, particularly of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, the most common causative agents of acute otitis media in childhood. 6. A significant rise in the MICs of the cephalosporins was observed in 4 of 43 patients in whom the same type of organism was isolated from the nasopharynx at weekly intervals during antibiotic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Serologic evidence of respiratory and rickettsial infections among Somali refugees.
AB  - Somali refugees living in a camp located in Djibouti were studied in October 1991 and May 1992. The refugees had been living at the camp for about two years. The median age of volunteers was 25 years, of whom 69% were female. Paired sera obtained seven months apart were evaluated by complement fixation, microimmunofluorescence, indirect fluorescent antibody, streptococcal antibody, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques for evidence of pathogen infection. Fifty-two percent, 31.3%, 8.0%, 5.9%, and 25.4% of the volunteers had serologic evidence for pre-enrollment infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rickettsia typhi, R. conorii, and Coxiella burnetti, respectively. Similarly, 43.5%, 5.2%, 6.1%, 10.7%, 15.8%, and 11.9% of the volunteers studied had serologic evidence for new infection with Streptococcus pyogenes, C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, R. typhi, R. conorii, and Cox. burnetii, respectively. These data suggest that the studied pathogens may be endemic in displaced populations living in the Horn of Africa.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in Japan.
AB  - Bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. Of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and 891 were gram-negative. Major pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pnuemoniae and S. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. New quinolones and new generation cephems were active against H. influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. Only one strain of S. aureus was methicillin-resistant. As regards other pathogens, 6.5% of S. pneumoniae and 14.9% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. MRSA was found infrequently. But ampicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.
TI  - Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: cost-effective diagnosis and treatment.
AB  - Most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis, although Neisseria gonorrhea, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly Corynebacterium haemolyticum), Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR agent), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens. Viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. Reliance on clinical impression to diagnose GAS tonsillopharyngitis is problematic; an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically occurs for adult patients. Overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. Existing data suggest that rapid GAS antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. When used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting GAS-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective. Penicillin has been the treatment of choice for GAS tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s; 10 days of treatment are necessary for bacterial eradication. A single IM injection of benzathine penicillin is effective and obviates compliance issues. Until the early 1970s, the bacteriologic failure rate for the treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis ranged from 2% to 10% and was attributed to chronic GAS carriers. Since the late 1970s, the penicillin failure rate has frequently exceeded 20% in published reports. Explanations for recurrent GAS tonsillopharyngitis include poor patient compliance; reacquisition from a family member or peer, copathogenic colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes that inactivate penicillin with beta-lactamase, or all these organisms; suppression of natural immune response by too-early administration of antibiotics; GAS tolerance to penicillin; antibiotic eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that normally act as natural host defenses; and establishment of a true carrier state. When therapy fails, milder symptoms may occur during the relapse. Several antimicrobials have demonstrated superior efficacy compared with penicillin in eradicating GAS and are administered less frequently to enhance patient compliance. In previously untreated GAS throat infections, cephalosporins produce a 5% to 22% higher bacteriologic cure rate; after a penicillin treatment failure, these differences are greater. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and the extended-spectrum macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may also produce enhanced bacteriologic eradication in comparison to penicillin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Persistent acute otitis media: II. Antimicrobial treatment.
AB  - In this three-year prospective study, 137 children with acute otitis media (AOM)  that had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent AOM) underwent tympanocentesis to determine additional antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolate(s). One hundred eleven children with AOM not previously treated are described for comparison. In the persistent AOM group middle ear aspirates grew Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), Haemophilus influenzae (7%), Brahamella catarrhalis (7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (6%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), two pathogens (3%) or no bacterial growth (49%); pathogens in previously untreated AOM were similar but fewer patients (30%) had no bacterial growth. After tympanocentesis additional antimicrobial therapy for persistent AOM patients utilizing drugs shown to be effective in vitro against the isolated pathogen failed to produce clinical resolution of infection in 27 (28%) of ears. Differing clinical efficacy was observed with various antimicrobials: amoxicillin (57% failure); trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75% failure); cefaclor (37% failure); cefixime (23% failure); amoxicillin/clavulanate (12% failure); and cefuroxime axetil (13% failure). Presumptive clinical cure for previously untreated AOM patients was similar to that for untreated AOM except for fewer amoxicillin failures (30%). We conclude that clinical failure in persistent AOM occurs (1) even when no pathogen is isolated from tympanocentesis (50% of patients) and (2) despite demonstrated in vitro activity against culture-proved pathogens.
TI  - Persistent acute otitis media: I. Causative pathogens.
AB  - In this prospective study tympanocentesis was performed to determine the pathogens isolated from middle ear fluid of 200 ears in 137 children with acute otitis media (AOM) which had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent AOM). For comparison tympanocentesis from 154 ears in 111 children with AOM not previously treated are described. Patients were enrolled from October, 1989, until September, 1992. In the persistent AOM group amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most frequently used antimicrobials before tympanocentesis. Middle ear aspirates produced no pathogenic bacterial growth in 49% of persistent AOM patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 24%, Haemophilus influenzae in 7%, Branhamella catarrhalis in 7%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5% and two pathogens in 3%. Two (18%) of 11 S. pneumoniae isolates tested were penicillin-resistant; 1 was intermediate and 1 was highly resistant. Ten (83%) of 12 H. influenzae and all of 11 B. catarrhalis AOM isolates produced beta-lactamase. In comparison previously untreated AOM patients produced no bacterial growth from tympanocentesis in 30%, S. pneumoniae in 36% (8% penicillin-resistant), H. influenaze in 13% (44% beta-lactamase-producing) and B. catarrhalis in 11% (85% beta-lactamase producing). AOM which is persistent after initial empiric antimicrobial therapy may be caused by middle ear inflammation after bacteria are killed or involve penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae or B. catarrhalis more commonly than occurs in AOM which has not been recently treated.
TI  - Detection of alpha- and beta-hemolytic-like activity from Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Alpha-hemolytic-like activity from Campylobacter jejuni was clearly apparent when the medium pH ranged from 6.0 to 6.5, but the hemolytic zones disappeared when the pH of the medium increased. Beta-hemolytic-like activity just beneath the bacterial growth appeared after prolonged incubation. The hemolytic activity was not influenced by the species of blood.
TI  - [Clinical studies on minocycline in infantile acute pharyngolaryngitis with cough].
AB  - Among cases of infantile acute pharyngolaryngitis with cough as a chief complaint, 21 cases that the involvement of bacterial infections has been demonstrated were given minocycline (MINO) and the effectiveness and safety of MINO were investigated. 1. Regarding the clinical effectiveness, the number of cases assessed as markedly effective was 9 (43%) and that as effective was 8 (38%), so that the effectiveness rate was 81%, and particularly, in the infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, MINO showed a high effectiveness. 2. Five strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 16 strains of H. influenzae, a total of 23 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated, and MINO showed high activities against not less than 80% of these strains. 3. The bacteriological effect in terms of the rate of eradication was 71%, and that of H. influenzae was as high as 88%, while S. pneumoniae remained in 3 of 5 cases. 4. Adverse reactions were observed in 2 cases (10%), 1 case each of abdominal pain and stomatitis, and both of them were improved after the treatment termination. 5. Regarding the usefulness, which was comprehensively assessed using clinical effectiveness and safety as criteria, the number of cases evaluated satisfactorily useful was 8 (38%) and that as useful was 8 (38%), so that the overall usefulness rate was 76%. From the above results, it was confirmed that MINO is a drug having high efficacy and safety against infantile acute pharyngolaryngitis with cough as a chief complaint caused by H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555, a new oral penem, were carried out, and the following results were obtained. 1. MICs were determined for 6 drugs, SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefdinir (CFDN) against 20 strains of bacteria isolated from patients who were subsequently treated with SY5555. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 microgram/ml against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, and MICs were from < or = 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae. These MIC values were equivalent or superior to those of the other 5 drugs. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-negative bacilli were 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and these values were equivalent to those of the other drugs, except CPDX. The MIC of SY5555 was 0.39 microgram/ml against 2 strains of Escherichia coli, and this value was equivalent or superior to those of CVA/AMPC and CCL, similar or inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, and inferior to that of CTM. The MICs of several drugs were determined for 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis and 30 strains of Campylobacter jejuni isolated from patients before this clinical study. The MICs of SY5555 against the 10 strains of B. pertussis were compared with those of 7 drugs, CCL, CTM, CPDX, ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM) and erythromycin (EM). The MIC of SY5555 was 0.78 microgram/ml against all of the strains. This value was superior to those of CCL, CTM and CPDX, similar or inferior to that of IPM and inferior to those of PIPC and EM. The MICs of SY5555 against the 30 strains of C. jejuni were compared with those of 7 drugs. CCL, CTM, CPDX, CFDN, ABPC, IPM and EM, and the MIC of SY5555 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml or 0.05 microgram/ml and these values were equivalent or superior to those of the 7 reference drugs. 2. SY5555 dry syrup was administered orally at 30 min. after meals, to a total of 5 patients, at doses of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg to 2 patients each and at a dose of 15.0 mg/kg to one patient and the plasma concentrations were determined. Peak concentrations were detected 1 to 3 hours after administration in all patients and the peak concentrations were 0.93 and 1.21 micrograms/ml at the 5.0 mg/kg dose, 2.85 and 5.49 micrograms/ml at the 10.0 mg/kg dose and 5.79 micrograms/ml at the 15.0 mg/kg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - [Microbiological study of the nasopharynx].
AB  - A microbiological study of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx have been carried out in 90 children subjected to adenoidectomy by chronically hypertrophied and infected adenoids. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are the most important pathogens responsible for upper respiratory tract infection. Adenoidectomy produces a physiological effect on the nasopharyngeal microflora by converting an abnormal flora into a nearly normal one. It has been found out that there is a relation between nasopharyngeal pathogens and the seasonal periods, showing a decrease in summer.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatrics].
AB  - We assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of SY5555 in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. In vitro antibacterial activities of SY5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN). Against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SY5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. In cases of Gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 against Haemophilus influenzae was inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 was less potent than that of CPDX. 2. Forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with SY5555 dry syrup (powder dissolved just before use). The clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. Bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. Side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases) and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. The only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. The palatability of SY5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. From the above results, SY5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of SY5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on SY5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities. MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. The plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. The half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. The urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. Clinical results The clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. The treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). Bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of SY5555. The effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. Eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on SY5555 in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555 were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 15 patients considered to have bacterial infections were treated with SY5555. Each dose, 5 mg/kg, was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-11 days. Clinical efficacies of SY5555 in 13 patients with bacterial infections (1 with pneumonia, 2 with bronchitis, each 1 with maxillary sinusitis, 2 with otitis media, 5 with pharyngitis, 1 each with gastroenteritis and pyelonephritis) were evaluated as excellent in 10 patients and as good in 3 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Two patients with viral infection and malignant lymphoma were not evaluated. Thirteen causative strains in 7 species were found in 10 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1/3, Haemophilus influenzae in 2/2, Streptococcus pyogenes 4/4, Salmonella spp. in 1/1, Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Only one patient developed mild diarrhea as an adverse reaction. Another patient showed elevated GPT (glutamate pyruvate transaminase). The abnormality was mild and the patient recovered after the cessation of SY5555 administration without specific treatment. 2. MICs of SY5555 were examined against 33 clinical isolates. SY5555 has low MICs against Enterococcus faecalis and other Gram-positive cocci. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak plasma concentrations of SY5555 was 1.15 micrograms/ml at a dose level of 4.9 mg/kg orally administered at fasting. Based on the above results and the broad spectrum of the anti-bacterial activities, SY5555 appears to be a promising antibiotics that is usable as a single agent for the primary therapy of respiratory tract infections, skin soft tissue infections and urinary tract infections in children.
TI  - In vitro activities of a streptogramin (RP59500), three macrolides, and an azalide against four respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Broth microdilution tests were carried out with 2,671 respiratory tract isolates  from 19 medical centers throughout the continental United States. The tests compared a streptogramin (RP59500) to erythromycin, dirithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Against macrolide-susceptible strains, the potency of RP59500 was similar to that of the macrolides: the azalide, azithromycin, was two to four times more potent against H. influenzae. The azalide and three macrolides showed nearly complete cross-resistance. At 2.0 micrograms/ml or less, the streptogramin, RP59500, was active against both macrolide-resistant and -susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae (MIC for 50% of the strains tested, 0.25 microgram/ml; MIC for 90% of the strains tested, 0.5 microgram/ml).
TI  - Postantibiotic effects and postantibiotic sub-MIC effects of roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin on respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Pharmacodynamic parameters have become increasingly important for the determination of the optimal dosing schedules of antibiotics. In this study, the postantibiotic effects (PAEs), the postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA SMEs), and the sub-MIC effects (SMEs) of roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin on reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were investigated. The PAE was induced by 2x MICs (S. pneumoniae) or 10x MICs of the different drugs for 2 h, and the antibiotics were eliminated by washing and dilution. The PA SMEs were studied by addition of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x MICs during the postantibiotic phase of the bacteria, and the SMEs were studied by exposition of the bacteria to the drugs at the sub-MICs only. Growth curves were followed by viable counts for 24 h. The SMEs were generally very short. A PAE of 2.9 to 8 h was noted for all antibiotics against all strains. Clarithromycin induced a statistically significantly shorter PAE on S. pneumoniae than did roxithromycin and azithromycin and did so also against H. influenzae in comparison with azithromycin. The PA SMEs were long and varied at 0.3x MIC between 6.4 19.6 h. This pronounced suppression of regrowth of bacteria which are first treated with a suprainhibitory concentration of antibiotics and then reexposed to sub-MIC levels indicates that long dosing intervals for macrolides and azalides can be allowed.
TI  - [Spiramycin (rovamycin), a macrolide antibiotic for oral treatment of outpatient  pneumonia].
AB  - Spiramycin activity against acute pneumonia has been studied in 21 outpatients (15 adults and 6 children). The drug was administered orally twice daily in a dose 3,000,000 units. The course lasted from 7 to 14 days. All the cases were confirmed roentgenologically. The disease ran a moderate-severity course. The response rate reached 95.2%. Another course of antibiotic therapy was not needed. Side effects were not registered. Bacteriological efficacy of spiramycin made up 71.3%. 14 out of 16 isolated strains of causative agents (S.pneumoniae, S.pyogenes, S.aureus, H.influenzae in 5, 1, 7 and 3 patients, respectively) proved sensitive to spiramycin. 2 patients developed mycoplasma infection diagnosed serologically. The findings confirm high therapeutic efficacy of spiramycin, its good tolerance. Spiramycin may be considered the drug of the priority choice in outpatient treatment of acute pneumonia.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of cefetamet against clinically isolated strains from community acquired respiratory tract infections (II)].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of cefetamet (CEMT) against clinically isolated strains  from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections were compared to those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics in the period from January to March 1994. The following results were obtained. 1. CEMT showed strong antibacterial activities against three major pathogens causing community acquired respiratory tract infections, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. However, antibacterial activities of CEMT against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were slightly weaker than of those of some the reference antibiotics. 2. No MIC value changes of CEMT were observed from year to year against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA.
AB  - In this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae genomic DNA. The target DNA sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the S. pneumoniae DNA polymerase I gene (pol I). PCR products of pure cultures of a set of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing S. pneumoniae. We were able to detect 2 fg of purified S. pneumoniae DNA. There were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp. nontypeable H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The addition of EDTA and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the PCR reaction mixture inhibited the PCR assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to PCR reaction mixture did not interfere with the ability to detect the presence of S. pneumoniae DNA.
TI  - [Respiratory tract infections: how frequent is antibiotic resistance? In vitro activity of older and recent antibiotics against the significant pathogens].
AB  - Presumably influenced by the new cost-saving health care regulations, more of the long-established antibiotics are now being prescribed. This fact prompted the present study on the current resistance profiles of such antibiotics used to treat major pathogens responsible for airway infections. A total of 202 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were investigated. Sensitivity was determined using the agar dilution test for doxycycline, erythromycin, penicillin G, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefpodoxime. In the case of such older antibiotics as doxycycline, erythromycin and amoxicillin, certain shortcomings in their efficacy against these common pathogens were found, while the bacteria were all sensitive to a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and to the oral cephalosporin, cefodoxime. In order to avoid the risk of ineffectivity in the treatment of infection of the airways, it is recommended that in Germany a new oral cephalosporin or a combination of an aminopenicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor be used.
TI  - Bacterial crude extracts or ribosomes are recognized similarly by peripheral and  mucosal B cells.
AB  - Bacterial ribosomes have been shown to induce effective humoral and cellular immunological responses to whole microorganisms. In this study, the numbers of specific antibody producing cells directed towards Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae ribosomes or whole bacteria sonicates were compared in the peripheral blood and tonsils of 7 children, and in the tonsils, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes of 10 sheep. No significant difference was noted between the two types of antigens, confirming that ribosomal preparations are able to mimic the immunogenicity of whole bacteria in the mucosae-associated lymphoid tissue.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran (CZOP) were performed in children. The results were as followed: 1. A total of 13 patients were treated with CZOP. The tested dose was 20 mg/kg (50 mg/kg in maxillary sinusitis), and the drug administered via intravenous bolus injection or 30-minute intravenous drip infusion 3 times daily, for 3-11 days. Clinical efficacies of CZOP in 13 patients with bacterial infections (11 with pneumonia, 1 with otitis media and 1 with maxillary sinusitis) were evaluated as excellent in 13 with an efficacy rate of 100%. Any adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory test results were not observed in any patients. Fourteen causative strains were found in 10 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4 cases out of 4, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1/1, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in 3/3, Haemophilus influenzae in 4/6 were eradicated. 2. Pharmacokinetic studies. The mean serum concentration immediately after intravenous drip infusion over 30-minute of 20 mg/kg was 39.1 micrograms/ml (range: 25.6-52.5 micrograms/ml). The mean urinary recovery rate over 8 hours after administration was 49.0% (range: 45.2-51.8%). Based on the above results and the broad spectrum and great antibacterial activity of CZOP, it is considered that CZOP is a promising antibiotic usable as a single agent for the primary therapy of acute bacterial infections ranging from mild to severe in children.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (V). The pattern of distribution on bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from patients with respiratory infections, who were seen in six private clinics, and clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin].
AB  - The pattern of distribution of bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from the same specimen recovered from the throat swab or the sputum of 479 patients with respiratory infections who were seen in six private clinics in Sendai City of Japan during the period from October to November in 1992 (period I) and from January to February in 1993 (period II) was documented. Of the 479 patients, 234 had acute pharyngitis, 145 had acute bronchitis, 96 had influenza, 21 had acute tonsillitis, 5 had acute pneumonia and 9 had other respiratory infections. One hundred (42.4%) strains of potential pathogen and one strain of M. pneumoniae were recovered from 236 cases in period I, and 66 (27.2%) strains of potential pathogen, one strain of M. pneumonae and 73 strains of Influenza virus (30.0%: 43 of type A Hong-Kong and 30 of type B) from 243 cases in period II. Of the 166 strains, major isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (56 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (15 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (17 strains), Esherichia coli (4 strains), Klebsiella spp. (35 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (23 strains). Only one strain of S. aureus was resistant to methicillin (MIC: 50 micrograms/ml). None of S. pneumoniae was resistant to 1 microgram/ml of ampicillin. Ciprofloxacin was administered to 113 cases and roxythromycin to 220 cases by doctors in charge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular characterization of cap3A, a gene from the operon required for the synthesis of the capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3: sequencing of mutations responsible for the unencapsulated phenotype and localization of the capsular cluster on the pneumococcal chromosome.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the cap3A gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is directly responsible for the transformation of some unencapsulated, serotype 3 mutants to the encapsulated phenotype, has been determined. This gene encodes a protein of 394 amino acids with a predicted M(r) of 44,646. Twelve independent cap3A mutations have been mapped by genetic transformation, and three of them have been sequenced. Sequence comparisons revealed that cap3A was very similar (74.4%) to the hasB gene of Streptococcus pyogenes, which encodes a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDP-GlcDH) that catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, the donor substances in the pneumococcal type 3 capsular polysaccharide. Furthermore, a PCR-generated cap3A+ gene restored encapsulation in our cap3A mutants as well as in a mutant previously characterized as deficient in UDP-GlcDH (R. Austrian, H. P. Bernheimer, E.E.B. Smith, and G.T. Mills, J. Exp. Med. 110:585-602, 1959). These results support the conclusion that cap3A codes for UDP-GlcDH. We have also identified a region upstream of cap3A that should contain common genes necessary for the production of capsule of any type. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting showed that the capsular genes specific for serotype 3 are located near the genes encoding PBP 2X and PBP 1A in the S. pneumoniae chromosome, whereas copies of the common genes (or part of them) appear to be present in different locations in the genome.
TI  - In vitro activities of 12 orally administered antimicrobial agents against four species of bacterial respiratory pathogens from U.S. Medical Centers in 1992 and 1993.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Moraxella catarrhalis were gathered from 19 different clinical laboratories throughout the continental United States. The in vitro activities of 12 orally administered antimicrobial agents were compared by broth microdilution tests with 3,151 bacterial isolates. Among 890 H. influenzae isolates, 30% were capable of producing beta-lactamase enzymes (12 to 41% in different medical centers). Most of the 619 beta-lactamase-negative H. influenzae strains were susceptible to ampicillicin (MIC, < or = 1.0 micrograms/ml): 5 strains were intermediate in susceptibility (MIC, 2.0 micrograms/ml) and 1 strain was ampilicillin resistant (MIC, 4.0 micrograms/ml). Ninety-two percent of 698 M. catarrhalis strains were beta-lactamase positive. Of 799 S. pneumoniae isolates, 15% were intermediate in susceptibility to penicillin and 7% were resistant to penicillin. The prevalence of penicillin-susceptible pneumococci in different institutions ranged from 63 to 95%. Only 1% of 764 S. pyogenes isolates were resistant to the macrolides, but 5% of S. pneumoniae isolates were macrolide resistant. Only 71% of 58 penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates were erythromycin susceptible, whereas 97% of the 622 penicillin-susceptible strains were erythromycin susceptible. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci were also relatively resistant to the cephalosporins and amoxicillin. Penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (MIC for 90% of isolates tested [MIC90], < or = 0.12/0.06 microgram/ml), cefixime (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), cefuroxime axetil (MIC90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml), cefprozil (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), cefaclor (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), and loracarbef (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml). Most strains of the other species remained susceptible to the study drugs other than amoxicillin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - To examine the antimicrobial activity of cefditoren (CDTR) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients at this hospital from November, 1993 to February, 1994, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined including those of the control drugs. The results were as follows: 1. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs of CDTR against benzylpenicillin-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae distributed in the lowest concentration range even compared to those of the control drugs. 2. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp. The MIC of CDTR against CEPs-resistant E. coli was lower than those of most control drugs. 3. Since the microbes described above the major pathogens for the community-acquired infections, CDTR will be effective against infectious diseases transmitted at outpatient visits.
TI  - Acute otorrhea: bacteriology of a common complication of tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - We prospectively followed 246 children with tympanostomy tubes and observed acute otorrhea through a functioning tube at least once in 50% of subjects. Pathogens typical of acute otitis media (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) were found in 42% of all episodes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus was found in 44% of all episodes. Pathogens of acute otitis media were found in 50.0% of subjects under 6 years old versus 4.4% of subjects 6 years or over at the first episode (p < .001). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found more often in children 6 years or older (43.5% versus 20.5% at the first episode, p = .052). Pathogens typical of acute otitis media were less prevalent in the summer months (14.7% versus 52.2% for the first episode, p = .001), while P aeruginosa was more prevalent in summer (44.1% versus 16.4% for the first episode, p = .006). This suggests that while many younger children with acute otorrhea may respond to treatment with oral antimicrobials alone, outpatient therapy of older children may involve use of topical antipseudomonal agents that may be complicated by the question of the safety of such medications.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--revisited.
AB  - The clinical course and causative organisms were studied in 18 patients with acute mastoiditis, 13 of whom (72%) had no previous history of middle ear disease. Their age ranged from 5 months to 21 years, and duration of middle ear symptoms immediately prior to admission ranged from 1 to 45 days (average 9.7 days). None had undergone a myringotomy prior to admission, while 13 (72%) had been receiving antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. Three were admitted with intracranial complications. Bacteria were isolated in 10 of the 16 patients in whom samples were available for bacterial culture, and included Streptococcus pneumonia (2), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Staphlococcus coagulase negative (2), Klebsiella pneumonia (1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Of the 17 patients treated by us, 11 received surgery. Acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, acute mastoiditis, subacute mastoiditis and masked mastoiditis create a continuum. Antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media cannot be considered as an absolute safeguard against acute mastoiditis. When antibiotics are prescribed for acute mastoiditis before culture result is available, an anti-staphylococcal agent should be included. At least some patients with acute mastoiditis develop a primary infection of the bony framework of the middle ear cleft. The prevalence of the intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis is still high and may appear soon after or concomitant with the first sign of acute mastioditis.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Compartmentalization of specific B-cells in sheep mucosae associated lymphoid organs.
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that Peyer's patches (PP) contribute to the seeding of other lymphoid organs in sheep. This was demonstrated by perfusing labeled lymphocytes in PP, and later investigating their presence in drainage lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood or bone marrow. These data showed that PP export considerable numbers of cells every day, but provided no information as to their specificity. In this work, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) spot method to investigate, in the peripheral blood, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes and tonsils from ten sheep, the numbers of specific B-cells, directed to four common bacteria of the oro-pharyngeal area of mammals: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae. The data were obtained from five sets of monozygous sheep, one animal of each pair being previously fed ribosomal preparations of these bacteria. Both prior to and after oral challenge, specific B-cells could be found in all the tissues tested. They were mostly IgG-producing cells and preferentially located in oro-pharyngeal drainage lymph nodes and tonsils. Their numbers increased in these lymph nodes after stimulation, while they decreased in mesenteric lymph nodes. These observations are consistent with the current hypothesis suggesting intestinal sensitization, proliferation and fast emigration of specific B-cells after oral challenge.
TI  - Otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic OM is reviewed. The major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute OM and half of serous OM cultures are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute OM. The predominant organisms isolated from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp. Many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. The appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of cefdinir on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyrogenes.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of a new cephalosporin, cefdinir, were determined against a range of organisms using a viable counting technique. Cefdinir exerted considerable PAEs against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but no overall post-antibiotic inhibition of growth was detected against Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Exposure to cefdinir made the gram-negative organisms susceptible to the washing procedure used for drug removal, but this was followed by rapid recovery of viability in drug-free broth.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatric field].
AB  - We have carried out bacteriological and clinical studies on L-627. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and phlegmon. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, Haemophilus parainfluenzae one strain) were eradicated. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases, except 2 cases each of elevated eosinophil counts and elevated platelet counts.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies in the pediatric field have been performed on biapenem (L-627), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, and the following results were obtained. 1. In the pharmacokinetic study, the plasma concentration of L-627 showed dose-dependant change: Cmax was 14.6 micrograms/ml and AUC was 15.4 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 6 mg/kg, while Cmax was 49.2 micrograms/ml and AUC was 60.1 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 12 mg/kg. After the administration of 6 mg/kg, the urinary concentration reached maximum within 2 hours and the cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours was 49.4%. 2. Antibacterial activities of L-627 against 27 strains of clinical isolates were determined. MICs of L-627 against such Gram-positive cocci as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were sufficiently low, and those against such Gram-negative rods as Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Bordetella pertussis were satisfactory and as low as those of imipenem or ceftazidime. 3. Clinical efficacies of L-627 were evaluated in 36 cases of bacterial infections. The overall efficacy rate was 100%, and excellent responses in 26 cases and good in 10 cases were obtained. As for bacteriological efficacies, all strains except 1 of B. pertussis were eradicated and a high eradication rate of 96.6% was obtained. 4. No side effects were observed in 37 evaluated cases. As abnormal laboratory test results, eosinophilia was noted in 2 cases (5.4%), but they returned to normal values rapidly after the drug was discontinued. From these results, it has been concluded that L-627 is a safe and effective drug to be used in treatment of pediatric infectious diseases.
TI  - Antibody-producing cells in peripheral blood and tonsils after oral treatment of  children with bacterial ribosomes.
AB  - The efficacy of ribosomal preparations as mucosal immunostimulants was examined in the peripheral blood and tonsils of 14 children, before and after 28 days of oral treatment with D-53, a preparation of ribosomes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Tonsils from 10 untreated children were used as controls. Immunofluorescence and ELISAspot were performed to analyse variations in the numbers of immunoglobulin-containing and immunoglobulin-secreting B-cells. Both isotypic and antigenic specificities of these two types of cells were investigated. Significant differences were observed after treatment in the peripheral blood as well as between tonsils from treated and untreated children. In the peripheral blood a significant increase in immunoglobulin-secreting cells directed against antigenic specificities of D-53 was the major change. In tonsils, higher numbers of specific immunoglobulin-containing and secreting cells, and higher numbers of IgA-secreting cells were induced in treated children. These data support the efficacy of D-53 as an oral immunostimulant.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. The mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. The mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. These drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; for Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae. The average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. The lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657, new rifamycin derivatives.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the new rifamycin derivatives KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were compared with those of rifampin. Rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin were also tested for reference. The respective MICs of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90S) were 0.016 and 0.0078 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.016 and 0.0039 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 0.0625 and 0.016 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. These MIC90S of KRM-1657 were equal to or 2- to 64-fold lower than those of rifampin. KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 with MIC90S of between 0.002 and 0.078 microgram/ml were 2- to 128-fold more active than rifampin against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC90S of KRM-1657 for Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 0.25 and 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively; KRM-1657 was almost as active as rifampin and was 8- to 16-fold more active than KRM-1648 against these strains. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutations to resistance to KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 was equal to that to rifampin. Against systemic infection with S. aureus in mice, the efficacies of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were comparable to that of rifampin.
TI  - [Comparative antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime (Podomexef, CAS 80210-62-4) against 236 clinical isolates of H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated and compared with that of another 8 commonly used oral antibiotics. beta-Lactamase negative, beta-lactamase positive and multiresistant strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by cefpodoxime at a concentration of 0.13 mg/l. 10% of Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were moderately susceptible to cefpodoxime, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefpodoxime ranging between 0.13 and 2.0 mg/l. All isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to < or = 0.25 mg/l cefpodoxime. Cefpodoxime was clearly more active than the older oral cephalosporins against all species tested. The activity was comparable to that of cefixime against all species except Streptococcus pneumoniae, against which cefpodoxime was more active than cefixime.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of streptococci isolated from blood from neutropenic patients.
AB  - MICs were performed on 62 streptococci isolated from the blood of neutropenic patients from 1986 to 1992 using the NCCLS broth microdilution procedure. Species isolated were 43 S. mitis, 6 S.pneumoniae, 5 S.sanguis, 1 S.pyogenes, 1 beta-hemolytic streptococcus of the group G, 1 S.adjacens, 1 S.intermedius, 4 not identified isolates (2 alpha-hemolytic, 1 non-hemolytic and 1 nutritionally variant strains). 26% of all strains were resistant or intermediate to penicillin (MIC 90: 2 mg/l) and 89% to norfloxacine (MIC 90: 32 mg/l). All were susceptible to vancomycin. Among cephalosporins, all strains were susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC 90: 1 mg/l), ceftriaxone (MIC 90: 1 mg/l) and cefepime (MIC 90: 2 mg/l) while 19% were R or I to ceftazidime (MIC 90: 16 mg/l). All were susceptible to imipenem (MIC 90: 0.5 mg/l) and meropenem (MIC 90: 1 mg/l). Among the third generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime--the agent of this class of antibiotics that is most often used for the empirical therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients (in combination but also in monotherapy)--has a high resistance rate as compared to the other compounds.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil in pediatric field].
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME1207) granules, a new oral cephem, was given to pediatric patients with infectious diseases to evaluate antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety, and the following results were obtained. 1. In sensitivity test, 30 strains were used comprised of 5 species, isolated from the patients before administered with CDTR-PI. Against Staphylococcus aureus, MICs of 7 agents, cefditoren (CDTR), cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram, cefotiam, cefpodoxime and methicillin, were determined. Against other 4 species, MICs of the above 6 agents excluding methicillin were determined. Among Gram-positive cocci tested, the MICs of CDTR were 0.78 to 100 micrograms/ml or higher against S. aureus (16 strains), < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (5 strains), and 0.10 or 0.39 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (2 strains). These values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems and of methicillin. Among Gram-negative rods tested, the MICs of CDTR were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (3 strains), and 0.10 or 0.20 microgram/ml against Escherichia coli (4 strains). Also, these values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems. 2. When CDTR-PI granules was orally administered in a single dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 1 patient and that of 6.0 mg/kg to 2 patients 30 minutes after meal, plasma CDTR concentrations reached their maxima 4 hours after administration in the former patient and 1 or 2 hours after administration in the latter 2 patients, and the peak plasma concentrations were 1.91, 3.46 and 4.82 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 1.01, 0.81 and 0.88 hours and AUCs of 8.62, 9.89 and 13.52 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Dose-dependency was observed for the peak plasma concentrations and AUCs also tended to depend on dose excepting for the AUC in one 6.0 mg/kg patient. 3. The urinary concentrations in the above patients reached their peaks at 4 to 6 hours after administration in one 3.0 mg/kg patient and at 4 to 6 hours and 2 to 4 hours after administration in two 6.0 mg/kg patients, and the corresponding values were 126.0, 195.0 and 234.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Recovery rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 18.2, 24.6 and 21.3%, respectively. 4. Of 53 patients with 13 diseases, CDTR-PI was clinically judged "excellent" in 32 (60.4%) and "good" in 21 (39.6%), showing excellent efficacy. 5. Bacteriologically, excellent results were obtained, i.e., 29 (96.7%) of 30 strains from 5 species were eradicated. 6. Side effects were observed in none of the 54 patients treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Susceptibility of respiratory and urinary pathogens to ceftibuten and other comparative drugs: results of an Italian multicenter survey. The Italian Ceftibuten Study Group.
AB  - A survey aimed at assessing the ability of ceftibuten, a new oral third-generation cephalosporin, to eradicate in vitro selected bacterial pathogens was conducted in 1991 in 17 microbiology laboratories evenly distributed in Italy. Over 8700 organisms collected from in- and outpatients affected mainly by respiratory and urinary tract infections were analyzed. This collection of bacteria did not include staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas and other oxidative species naturally refractory to the action of most antibiotics employed. Susceptibility to ceftibuten, cefaclor, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cotrimoxazole and erythromycin was assessed using a standardized agar-diffusion method. Production of beta-lactamases was confirmed by the nitrocefin test. Among the microorganisms studied E. coli (32.1%) prevailed, followed by P. mirabilis (17.1%), K. pneumoniae (10.9%), S. pyogenes (6.6%), E. cloacae (5.1%), Serratia spp. (4.5%), Enterobacter spp. (4.2%), H. influenzae (3.6%), S. pneumoniae (2.2%) and M. catarrhalis (2%). Within this group of pathogens amoxicillin resistance, often mediated by synthesis of beta-lactamases, was widely diffused (46.2%). The overall inhibitory activity of the drugs tested decreased as follows: ceftibuten (90.4%), cefuroxime (80.4%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (77.4%), cotrimoxazole (75.3%), cefaclor (72.6%), amoxicillin (53.8%) and erythromycin (32.8%). When the efficacy of the antibiotics was assessed against the collection of respiratory isolates producing beta-lactamases only ceftibuten maintained the same overall potency manifested against the general population while the comparative agents were far less effective. The results of this national survey indicate that, given the low incidence of resistance among the most prevalent causative agents of respiratory and urinary tract infections, ceftibuten can be safely used at present in the empiric therapy of these conditions especially when they occur in community settings.
TI  - Cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - Cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin C. Cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. The majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. These include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other streptococci (excluding group D streptococci), and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella and Shigella and Straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). The pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. The absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. The protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. Tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. Cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. An oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. Constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). Cefuroxime axetil is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). For most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate. In some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. If pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. Adverse reactions to cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - We have investigated the local immune response of the BALB/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. After two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgM, and IgA) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. The procedure followed the principle of the classical ELISPOT test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (Eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. Lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific IgA synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas IgG and IgM production rates showed no remarkable differences. In addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific IgA titers but not increased IgM and IgG levels. We conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced IgA response in a distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.
TI  - Penetration of clarithromycin and its 14-hydroxy metabolite into middle ear effusion in children with secretory otitis media.
AB  - Clarithromycin suspension was given at a dosage of 7.5 mg/kg bd for 7 days to 31  children with secretory otitis media, scheduled for insertion of grommets. The fifth dose was given approximately 2.5 h before myringotomy and aspiration of the middle ear effusion at which time a blood sample also was taken. In addition, in 16 children blood samples were taken at 1, 1.5 and 4 h after the fifth dose. The concentrations of clarithromycin and its active 14-hydroxylated metabolite, in middle ear effusion and serum, were determined by HPLC. Before therapy, at surgery on day 3 and after completion of treatment, nasopharyngeal samples were taken for culture and susceptibility testing. In the middle ear effusions mean concentrations of clarithromycin (2.5 mg/L) and metabolite (1.3 mg/L) were considerably higher than the serum concentrations (1.7 and 0.8 mg/L, respectively). The mean concentrations in middle ear effusion exceeded the MICs for most respiratory pathogens. Complete eradication of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx was achieved after three days of therapy. Approximately 50% of the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated from approximately 50% of the patients and the growth of the persisting strains was decreased from abundant or moderate to sparse. Adverse events were mild and transient and were experienced by only two of the 31 children.
TI  - Nutritional profile and antimicrobial spectrum of the spice Aframomum danielli K. Schum.
AB  - The spice, Aframomum danielli, on a wet weight basis with a moisture content of 10.5%, protein content of 8.2% (dry matter basis) and caloric value of 469.7 kcal/100 g, contains in varying amounts, minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc and copper. Amino acids found in varying concentrations in A. danielli include L-Threonine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-Glutamic acid, glycine, L-Leucine and L-Lysine. Using minimum inhibition zone of 20-22 mm in diameter, A. danielli inhibited the growth of Salmonella enteriditis, Psudomonas fragi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, A. ochraceus and A. niger. The minimum concentration (MIC) determined for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 in 320 whilst the MIC for S. aureus was 1 in 8,000.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefditoren pivoxil in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies were performed in pediatrics on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME1207) in granules. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of CDTR after administration of CDTR-PI to children (ages between 1 and 10) were investigated. Five cases were administrated with CDTR-PI at a dose level of 3 mg/kg 30 minutes after meal. Serum concentrations in these cases reached their peaks at 2 hours after administration with an average level of 1.23 +/- 0.34 micrograms/ml and diminished to 0.04 +/- 0.04 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration with a half-life of 1.60 +/- 0.38 hours. Urinary recovery rates of CDTR in the first 8 hours after administration of CDTR-PI averaged 14.9 +/- 0.9%. Five cases were administered with CDTR-PI at a dose level of 6 mg/kg 30 minutes after meal. Serum concentrations with the drug after meal reached their peaks at 1 hour after administration with an average level of 2.62 +/- 0.42 micrograms/ml and diminished to 0.21 +/- 0.11 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration with a half-life of 1.58 +/- 0.31 hours. Urinary recovery rates of CDTR in the first 8 hours after administration of CDTR-PI averaged 17.0 +/- 0.7%. These data also showed that serum and urinary concentrations of the drug depended on dose levels. 2. CDTR-PI was administered to 31 pediatric patients (their ages ranged between 1 year and 10 years) with various infections, and clinical and bacteriological effects and adverse reactions were investigated. Clinical effects were evaluable in 24 cases including 2 cases of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute pharyngitis, 12 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 5 cases of acute pneumonia. Clinical responses were excellent in 16 cases, effective in 8 cases, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Antimicrobial effects against a total of 16 strains identified or assumed to be pathogenic bacteria were evaluated. The 16 strains of bacteria included 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. All the bacteria listed here were judged to have been eradicated except 2 strains of H. influenzae (1 was decreased and 1 was unchanged) thus, the eradication rate was 87.5%. Two strains of bacteria replaced infection causing bacteria. Streptococcus pneumoniae replaced S. pyogenes and S. aureus replaced H. influenzae. No adverse side reactions were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriologic study of 80 cases of acute otitis media in children].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Etiology of acute otitis media (AOM) in children is almost unknown in our country. We report 80 cases in order to study the most common pathogens. METHODS: Eighty healthy children diagnosed of acute otitis media were studied between June 1989 and March 1992. Tympanocentesis was performed on each patient with an Abbocath-20G needle connected to a sterile syringe. RESULTS: Some pathogens was isolated in 58 patients (72.5%) and in 22 (27.5%) the culture was sterile or with usual flora of the external canal. S. pneumoniae was recovered in 26 cases (32.5%); H. influenzae in 23 cases (28.7%); S. pyogenes 4 cases (5%); E. coli 4; P. aeruginosa 3 (3.7%); S. aureus 2 (2.5%); anaerobes 2 cases. M. catarrhalis was not found in any cases. In 6 children there was mixed flore. CONCLUSIONS: In 80 children with AOM some pathogens was isolated in 58 cases (72.5%). The most common agents were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Bacterial resistance in eastern Europe--selected problems.
AB  - The profile of infection and pattern of bacterial resistance in Eastern Europe is distinct from that observed in other parts of the world. Several Polish investigations have reported that environmental pollution may increase the risk of respiratory disease. Studies from Hungary and Romania have documented a dramatic increase in the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to antibiotics. In comparison, resistance to these agents amongst Polish pneumococci isolates is lower, although these pathogens and Streptococcus pyogenes have displayed increasing tetracycline resistance. 20% of Polish Haemophilus influenzae isolates and a high percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains exhibit ampicillin resistance. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been found to constitute 22% of Polish S. aureus strains. Two major clones of MRSA have been identified in Poland which differ in their degree of antimicrobial resistance. The pattern of antimicrobial resistance amongst Polish respiratory pathogens is undoubtedly a reflection of management policies and the use of these drugs. It is hoped that the economic and political changes taking place within Eastern Europe will provide the information and resources to establish more efficient infection control and antibiotic policy and thus delay and limit the appearance of bacterial resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - Rabbit CAP18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  - CAP18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kDa) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of Re-lipopolysaccharide coated erythrocytes. The C-terminal 37 amino acids of CAP18 comprise the LPS-binding domain called RNIP, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. Synthetic RNIP has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [IC50 = 130-200 nM] and gram negative bacteria [IC50 = 20-100 nM). Susceptible strains include Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. Although a 32 amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the C terminus of RNIP is highly active, other fragments of RNIP including truncation of its N-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. Unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins RNIP is active in serum. RNIP or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.
TI  - Stability in the presence of widespread beta-lactamases. A prerequisite for the antibacterial activity of beta-lactam drugs.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam drugs is extremely widespread, as a result of extensive drug use. Loss of susceptibility is primarily attributable to hydrolysis by inactivating enzymes, namely the beta-lactamases. While the number of characterised beta-lactamases may exceed 100, only a few are a problem in the treatment of community-acquired infections (TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, BRO-1). Chromosomally mediated and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are usually dominant in nosocomial pathogens where oral antibiotic therapy is seldom used. Therefore, the threat posed by beta-lactamases must be considered in general practice. Several effective strategies have been implemented in order to overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance, e.g. use of non-beta-lactam drugs or beta-lactamase inhibitors. Another option has been the development of new beta-lactam compounds that possess a high intrinsic stability against the hydrolytic action of common beta-lactamases. Among these compounds, the oral third generation cephalosporins represent an important breakthrough. Cefetamet pivoxil, a new oral third generation cephalosporin, is characterised by excellent antimicrobial potency against Enterobacteriaceae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of their ability to produce beta-lactamases. The Gram-positive respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae, are also satisfactorily covered. The activity of cefetamet has recently been corroborated in a survey conducted in Italy involving 4191 isolates. However, cefetamet shows no activity against enterococci, staphylococci, Listeria, alpha-streptococci, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and anaerobes. Given this antibacterial profile, cefetamet pivoxil may provide a useful alternative to other oral antibacterial agents in the empirical therapy of acute community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections. From the results of the Italian survey, cefetamet emerged as the only agent among those considered (which included cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefalexin, cefadroxil, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, doxycycline, erythromycin and clindamycin) that might be selected as the drug of choice in the empirical therapy of outpatient infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on S-1108 in pediatric field].
AB  - S-1108 is a new oral esterified cephem antibiotic. Its active form, S-1006, has a broad antimicrobial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, S-1006 is extremely stable against beta-lactamases with some exceptions. In the present study, we conducted laboratory and clinical evaluations of S-1108 granules in pediatrics. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. A drug sensitivity test revealed that MIC80 of the drug against 456 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus that had been kept in our laboratory was 6.25 micrograms/ml, similar to those of cefaclor (CCL) and methicillin (DMPPC). The most frequent MIC was 1.56 micrograms/ml against 20 strains of S. aureus isolated from patients who received this drug, and this value was similar to those for CCL, amoxicillin (AMPC) and DMPPC. As regards to Streptococcus pyogenes, MIC of S-1006 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against 449 clinical isolates in our culture collection and 7 strains obtained from patients who received this drug, and these MICs are similar to those of cefteram (CFTM). MICs of S-1006 against 5 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from patients who received this drug were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml, 0.10 microgram/ml or 0.39 microgram/ml which are similar to those of CFTM. MICs of S-1006 against 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae obtained from patients who received this drug were 0.05 or 0.10 microgram/ml which are similar to those of CFTM. 2. When S-1108 granule preparation was administered to 1 patient at 4.0 mg/kg, the peak plasma concentration of S-1006 was 1.25 microgram/ml. S-1108 granule preparation was also administered to 2 patients at 6.0 mg/kg, and the peak plasma concentrations were 2.43 micrograms/ml and 2.23 micrograms/ml. Plasma half-lives were 1.11 hours after 4.0 mg/kg and 1.28 hours in both patients given 6.0 micrograms/ml. AUCs were 4.06, 8.37 and 7.73 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. A dose-response relationship was observed between the two doses. 3. Urinary concentration was the highest during the 4-6-hour period for a patient given 4.0 mg/kg, and during the 0-2-hour or 4-6-hour period for 2 patients given 6.0 mg/kg. The peak concentrations were 258.0, 602.0 and 500.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and urinary recovery rates during the 0-8-hour period were 38.9, 38.3 and 23.1%, respectively. 4. Clinical effects were excellent or good in 88 of 93 patients, showing a very high efficacy rate of 94.6%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical experience with S-1108 on bacterial infection in the pediatric field].
AB  - The effects of S-1108, an orally active cephem antibiotic newly synthesized by Shionogi Res. Lab., on pediatric bacterial infections was studied. S-1108 was administered orally at a daily dose between 9.3 and 12.4 mg/kg in three divided doses (after each meal) for 5 to 11 days to patients with pharyngitis (2), tonsillitis (1), bronchitis (3), pneumonia (1), lymphadenitis (1), enteritis (1) and cystitis (1). The clinical efficacy rate was 100% with excellent responses in 3, good in 6 and undetermined in 1. Bacteriological effects observed indicated that one strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae and two strains of Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated by the treatment. No clinical side effects and laboratory test abnormalities were observed at all in this study. These results suggested that S-1108 would be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of S-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were performed in the field pediatrics. The following results were obtained. 1) Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of S-1006, the active form of S-1108, were studied against clinically isolated strains of (Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 3), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 8), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 5) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 2). MIC values ranged < or = 0.025-1.56 for GPC and < or = 0.025-0.78 microgram/ml for GNR. 2) Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of S-1108 were measured upon administration of S-1108 after meal at dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), 4 mg/kg (n = 1) and 6 mg/kg (n = 1). The peak blood concentrations of S-1006 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), ranged from 0.57 to 1.82 micrograms/ml at 1, 2 and 4 hours after dosing. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters T1/2 and AUC were 1.29 +/- 0.69 hours and 4.47 +/- 2.25 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. At a dose of 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 1.79 and 1.27 micrograms/ml at 2 and 3 hours after treatment. T1/2 and AUC were 1.34 and 1.11 hours, and 8.19 and 5.65 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates ranged from 13.0 to 37.2% for the first 8 hours after administration. 3) Clinical studies Clinical efficacies were examined in 32 cases of various pediatric infections including 5 cases of acute pneumonia, 11 cases of bronchitis, 2 cases of scarlet fever, 8 cases of tonsillitis, 1 case of pharyngitis, 2 cases of otitis media and 3 cases of UTI. Clinical efficacy rate was 96.9% (31/32) and bacteriological eradication rate was 87.1% (27/31). There were no side effects and abnormal laboratory test values except 1 case (Eosino. 2-->10%) in the 32 cases.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on S-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Laboratory and Clinical Studies on S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out to evaluate its usefulness at a dose between 2 and 4 mg/kg a day for 7 to 14 days in the pediatric field. 1) Pharmacokinetic studies S-1108 at a dose of 2 mg/kg was administered to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters in 1 subject. Cmax, T1/2 and AUC were 0.69 hour, 1.42 hours and 2.15 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. 2) Antimicrobial activities MICs against various clinically isolated organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae) were determined. The MIC values of S-1006 were similar to those of cefteram, the MICs against S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae were < or = 0.025 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. 3) Clinical studies S-1108 was administered to patients with various pediatrics infections in 34 cases (upper respiratory tract infections: 12 cases, lower respiratory tract infections: 5 cases, urinary tract infections: 9 cases, skin and soft tissue infection: 6 cases, otitis media: 2 cases). Clinical efficacy rate was evaluated according to "Standard of clinical evaluation in pediatrics field". The responses were all good or excellent. 4) Side reactions There were no serious adverse reactions in any cases. The above results suggest that S-1108 is potent effective and safe agent in the pediatric field at a dose between 2-4 mg/kg (t.i.d.) a day.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S-1108 in children].
AB  - A new oral cephem antibiotic, S-1108, was evaluated for its clinical efficacy and safety in children. S-1108 was effective in 95% of the 59 examined cases of respiratory, middle ear, skin and urinary tract infections. S-1108 was highly effective in infections of Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, but was less effective in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus infections. The serum half-life was 1.26 +/- 0.36 hours upon after meal administration of 4 mg/kg. No severe adverse reaction was encountered. From these data, S-1108 appears to be safe and effective in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on S-1108 in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on S-1108 were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 11 patients were treated with S-1108. Each dose was 3 mg/kg, orally administered 3 times daily for 4-14 days. The clinical efficacies of S-1108 in 10 patients with bacterial infections (1 with bacteremia, 4 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 1 with scarlet fever and 2 with streptococcal pharyngitis) were evaluated as excellent in 8 patients and as good in 2 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Only one patient with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome due to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) who received gamma-globulin was not evaluated. Fourteen causative strains of 5 species were found in 10 patients. Three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae out of 5, 2 of 3 Branhamella catarrhalis strains, none of Staphylococcus aureus and all 3 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes were eradicated. No adverse reaction was observed in any of the 11 patients. 2. MICs of S-1108 against 5 clinically isolated S. pneumoniae from cases of infections were examined. All of them were relatively highly resistant to penicillins. S-1108 was compared with cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefaclor and cefixime, and it showed better antibacterial activity or than other cephems. 3. Double peaks were obtained in plasma levels of S-1108 orally administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg at 30 minutes after meal and were 1.03 microgram/ml and 0.74 microgram/ml at 1 and 4 hours after administration, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Induction of the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by Bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  - The presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of Bacteroides (B.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. The importance, however, of these microorganisms in the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of B. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. Prostaglandin E2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the cAMP-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. Of the bacterial species tested, B. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin E2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
TI  - Bacterial lysates and ribosomes as inducers of specific immune responses: a comparative study.
AB  - A bacterial lysate (OM-85 BV), a preparation of purified bacterial ribosomes (D53) and a placebo were tested for ability to induce the local appearance of specific antibody-containing cells. The three compounds were given orally to 90 children who required tonsillectomy. Surgery was carried out after 1 month of therapy. Frozen-cut sections of each tonsil were tested in indirect immunofluorescence. Cells containing antibodies directed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae were enumerated. Lowest values were noted in the placebo group. Slightly higher numbers were observed after treatment with OM-85 BV, but significant increases were noted only for the elevated numbers of specific antibody-containing cells observed after D53 therapy. Bacterial ribosomal preparations thus contribute efficient induction of specific local immune responses in man.
TI  - Cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. Because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria rapidly. In addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. It has good affinity for PBPs 2 and 3 of Escherichia coli and for PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its broad-spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. Other Gram-negative organisms, Haemophilus influenzae, Neiserria meningitidis, Neiserria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. Among Gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. Cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Only strains of P. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. In experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.
TI  - Separation and isolation of viable bacteria by capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Mixtures of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Streptococcus pyogenes  (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6303), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), were resolved into discrete electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. Analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. E. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. These findings suggest that CZE can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.
TI  - Streptococcal update. A microbiology perspective.
AB  - The streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. Rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the Aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by Group A Streptococcus. Group B, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. A major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. Australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of S pneumoniae. The oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. Disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, Group A has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.
TI  - A new method to determine postantibiotic effect and effects of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations.
AB  - It has been shown that bacteria in a postantibiotic (PA) phase exposed to subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibiotics show a long delay before regrowth. This effect has been named the PA sub-MIC effect (PA SME). In the present study, we have used a new method to demonstrate this phenomenon. A computerized incubator for bacteria, Bioscreen C (Lab Systems, Helsinki, Finland), which incubates the bacteria, measures growth continuously by vertical photometry, processes the data, and provides a printout of the results was used. With this method, one may easily test several antibiotics against different bacteria for PA effects (PAEs), PA SMEs, and SMEs. In this study, the effects of benzylpenicillin against beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci were examined. The bacteria were exposed to 2, 10, or 50x MIC for 2 h, washed and diluted, incubated in the Bioscreen C incubator, and then exposed to 0.1 to 0.9x MIC. The regrowth was monitored for 20 h. The PAE was calculated as the difference in the time required for the exposed and unexposed bacteria to grow to a defined point (A50) on the absorbance curve. A50 was defined as 50% of the maximum absorbance for the control cultures. The PA SMEs were calculated as the difference in the time required for the reexposed cultures and the unexposed controls to reach A50. The PAEs ranged between 0.6 and 3.2 h and varied little with the concentration used for the induction of the PAEs. At 0.2x MIC, the PA SMEs were 2 to 3 h longer than the PAEs. Higher sub-MICs increased this delay before regrowth. Most cultures exposed to sub-MICs alone were only slightly affected compared with the controls.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial respiratory pathogens in the nasopharynx in breast-fed versus formula-fed infants.
AB  - In several studies, breast-feeding has been associated with decreased frequency or duration of otitis media episodes. If a causal relationship exists, the mechanism of protection of breast-feeding has not been established. We hypothesized that infants who are breast-fed, compared with infants who are formula-fed, have a lower prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization with the bacterial respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes) commonly isolated from the middle ear effusions of children with acute otitis media. In two private pediatric practices, we obtained specimens from the nasopharynx for culture from 211 infants at 1 month of age and from 173 of these infants at 2 months of age. A swab was left in place in the nasopharynx for 45 s and was then immediately transferred onto appropriate culture media. Exclusively breast-fed (n = 84) and exclusively formula-fed (n = 76) infants were similar regarding the number of persons in the household, the number of children in the household, the number of siblings in day care, and the proportion with a recent upper respiratory tract infection. The two groups did not differ significantly in the proportions found to have one or more respiratory pathogens at 1 month of age (10.7 versus 18.4%; P = 0.12) or 2 months of age (34.8 versus 35.1%; P = 0.57). We conclude that during the first 2 months after birth, the exclusive receipt of breast milk appears not to substantially influence the prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization with common bacterial respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Prevalence of potential respiratory disease bacteria in children in Ethiopia. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens and use of antibiotics among the children.
AB  - Acute respiratory infections are primary causes of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. This project was designed to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from children in rural and city areas, and to contribute to the rational choice of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections in children in Ethiopia. Nasopharynx and throat cultures were taken from all children under five years of age in three study areas representing different levels of contact with health care and accessibility to modern drugs, such as antibiotics. In all, 1126 children were cultured. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were both found in 85-90% of the children, and beta-haemolytic streptococci group A in 12%. The level of antimicrobial resistance was low. None of the 954 strains of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Pneumococci were susceptible to penicillin. The use of antibiotics was also low; 11 of 1126 children had antibiotics on the day of culture or the day before. The choice of antibiotics was not limited by resistance, and emphasis could be put on low cost, minimizing adverse drug reactions and ecological impact.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by MEDLINE; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. STUDY SELECTION: Only published comparative clinical trial reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. Noncomparative clinical data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the Food and Drug Administration are not included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. In clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. Cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. Cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.
TI  - Overwhelming sepsis presenting as sudden unexpected death.
AB  - Four children, including three infants, who died suddenly and unexpectedly are described. In three of the cases group A beta haemolytic streptococcus was cultured and in the fourth Streptococcus pneumoniae. The organism was grown from multiple sites including blood in two of them. Without microbiological investigation the diagnosis would have been sudden unexpected death syndrome.
TI  - Adult response to initial treatment with ampicillin in community acquired pneumonia in Yaounde, Cameroon.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. Bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. Other etiologies were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (2) Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Moraxella catarrhails (1). Patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. There were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. The causative agents in patients with failures were: Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. Only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. Side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a mild skin rash. Due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.
TI  - Inflammatory diseases of the sinuses: bacteriology and antibiotics.
AB  - This article provides an overview of the antimicrobial agents most commonly employed against the bacteria that cause infections in the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck. Because new bacterial resistances appear so regularly, as do new antibiotics, the reader is encouraged to supplement the information provided within this article with current information from the available literature. Specific treatment strategies for both acute and chronic sinusitis also are reviewed.

TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - Haemophilus test medium versus Mueller-Hinton broth with lysed horse blood for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of four bacterial species.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine whether broth microdilution susceptibility tests could be standardized by using a single medium for testing fastidious respiratory pathogens. Mueller-Hinton broth with lysed horse blood and the broth version of Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM) were directly compared. Ten orally administered agents were found to give essentially identical results in both media but minor differences were noted. Because the test are easier to read when HTM broth is used, that medium is to be preferred for routine testing of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates by the microdilution procedure.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefditoren pivoxil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) in granules, a new oral cephalosporin, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities: Antibacterial activities of CDTR were studied against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in comparison with those of cefteram (CFTM), cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and cefotiam (CTM). MIC80's of CDTR against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and B. catarrhalis were 1.56, 0.39, < or = 0.025, < or = 0.025, 0.05 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results showed that CDTR has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. 2. Absorption and excretion: Serum concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CDTR-PI (administered in granules) were determined. Upon single oral doses of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, the peak serum concentrations were 0.5-2.45 micrograms/ml at 2 to 4 hours and 1.79-4.05 micrograms/ml at 1 to 4 hours, respectively, and T 1/2 was 1.07-9.67 hours and 0.99-3.00 hours, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, serum concentrations were 0-0.87 micrograms/ml with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 0.27-0.73 micrograms/ml with 6 mg/kg. These values indicated that the drug has a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic behavior. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours were 12.9-34.2% with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 11.8-26.9% with 6 mg/kg. 3. Clinical study: Clinical efficacies were examined in a total of 81 cases consisting of 20 cases of acute bronchitis, 13 of acute pneumonia, 21 of tonsillitis, 5 of pharyngitis, 7 of scarlet fever, 2 each of impetigo, otitis media and purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 1 of pertussis and 8 of UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 97.5% (79/81), and bacteriological eradication rate was 100% (76/76). As for side effects, 2 cases of watery stools and 1 case of minor elevation of GPT were observed.
TI  - [A clinical study on cefditoren pivoxil granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - The clinical efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) was evaluated in 45 patients with various infections. CDTR-PI was administered after meals at a dose of 3 mg/kg t.i.d. to most patients. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.3%. As side effects, diarrhea occurred in 2 patients. Cefditoren showed excellent antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and was more effective against Staphylococcus aureus than other cephems.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of ofloxacin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either once of four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. Similar to the results obtained previously with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin gave PAE values with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cell division of Klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited on removal of ofloxacin, but no clear PAE was demonstrated with this species because once replication recommenced, the mean generation times of drug-treated cultures were much shorter than those of untreated controls. Therefore, although the results obtained with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin imply a consistency of PAE for 4-quinolones within a species, the response to DNA damage induced by 4-quinolones is multifaceted and species dependent. 4-quinolones inhibit both DNA replication and cell division, whilst at the same time stimulating DNA repair pathways. Thus, in some cases PAEs result from an increased post-treatment lag phase which may be followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag may be followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being shorter than those of corresponding drug-free controls. The PAE of a drug-induced lag may thus be masked by rapid cell division once growth resumes.
TI  - The comparative activity of azithromycin, macrolides and amoxycillin against streptococci in experimental infections.
AB  - Since serious sequelae may follow streptococcal infections, eradication is viewed as necessary for successful therapy. Studies were therefore conducted to compare the effectiveness of azithromycin with other macrolide antibiotics and amoxycillin to eliminate these organisms in experimental localized infections. In a Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection induced by transtracheal challenge, the pathogen was not recovered after therapy with azithromycin (ED50 7.9 mg/kg), while clarithromycin was not effective (ED50 > 100 mg/kg). However, in a S. pneumoniae middle ear infection, azithromycin and clarithromycin were effective (ED50 2.9 and 6.3 mg/kg, respectively) in eradicating the pathogen from this closed space infection. Against a localized Streptococcus pyogenes infection (implanted inoculated disc), azithromycin effectively eradicated the pathogen, while clarithromycin, roxithromycin and erythromycin did not. Eradication of a viridans streptococcus or Streptococcus gordonii (formerly Streptococcus sanguis) from heart tissue in experimental bacterial endocarditis was also evaluated. Azithromycin given prophylactically or therapeutically was efficacious in eliminating the viridans streptococcus and S. gordonii in the bacterial endocarditis model of infection; erythromycin was only marginally effective in the same studies. All studies provided evidence of the bactericidal action of azithromycin in vivo and demonstrated the ability of the compound to eradicate streptococcal pathogens in localized infections.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the termini and chromosomal locus involved in site-specific integration of the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252.
AB  - The 47-kb, broad-host-range, streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252 is capable of site-specific integration into the pneumococcal chromosome. We present the nucleotide sequence of the terminal regions of the transposon and its target site in the pneumococcal genome. No inverted repeats were found at the termini of the transposon. A 72-bp region of the target was present on either side following the insertion of Tn5252 and appeared to serve as a signal for its integration and excision. The data suggest that the left copy of the 72-bp segment was a part of the conjugative element, the crossover point of integration was nonrandom within this region, and the mechanism of insertion could resemble that of the site-specific temperate phages.
TI  - The mouse peritonitis model: present and future use.
AB  - The mouse peritonitis model was the first experimental animal model to be used in antibiotic research in 1935, where it proved the effect of Prontosil and derivative sulphonamides against Streptococcus pyogenes in vivo. Since then the mouse peritonitis model has been a natural step in testing antibiotics in vivo before moving to larger animals or humans. Only a few bacteria are naturally virulent to mice, e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, but the mice can be rendered susceptible to most human pathogens by inhibition of one or more parts of the natural defence of the animals. For measuring the effect of antibiotics two parameters are usually considered: bacterial counts in fluids or tissues, or death/survival of the animal. Both parameters have flaws, but death is usually used, owing to the ease of observation and quantification by calculation of the 50% effective (protective or curative) doses. With these parameters a number of significant factors of importance for antibiotic effect have been detected or proven in this model. Together with the recent insight into the correlation of pharmacokinetic behaviour between these small animals and man, it is predicted that the mouse peritonitis model will continue to be an important means of studying the effect of antibiotics in vivo.
TI  - Loracarbef. A review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  - Loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. At low concentrations (< 2 mg/L) in vitro, it inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups B, C and G. Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. At therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. When administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. Loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. It is administered twice daily. It offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Pharyngitis associated with herpes simplex virus in college students.
AB  - During a 16-month period patients who presented to the Syracuse University Health Center with upper respiratory complaints had throat swabs obtained for viral, streptococcal and Mycoplasma pneumoniae cultures. Thirty-five of 613 patients (5.7%) had herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolated. All but 2 of the HSV isolates were found to be type 1 by immunofluorescent staining. Two HSV-positive patients also grew Group A Streptococcus, one grew M. pneumoniae and three had serum heterophile antibody tests that were positive. On physical examination 25 of the 35 HSV-positive patients had pharyngeal erythema and 14 had pharyngeal exudate. Twelve of these patients had vesicular lesions of the lips, throat or gums associated with their other symptoms. For 29 of the 35 HSV-positive students the primary diagnosis assigned was pharyngitis, for 2 the diagnosis was stomatitis and the remainder were assigned a primary diagnosis of upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, bronchitis or dental infection. Thirty-two of the 35 HSV-positive patients were treated with oral antibiotics and 7 were treated with oral or topical acyclovir. During the same 16-month period 89 (6.9%) of 1297 students presenting with sore throat were culture-positive for influenza A or B, 30 (2.3%) of 1283 were culture-positive for M. pneumoniae and 169 (2.8%) of the 6016 cultured for Group A Streptococcus were positive. Serum was tested for heterophile antibody in 2438 students, and 257 (10.5%) were positive. Herpes simplex virus is associated with pharyngeal symptoms in college students, and herpes simplex pharyngitis cannot easily be distinguished clinically from other causes of acute pharyngitis in this age group.
TI  - Clinical scoring system in the evaluation of adult pharyngitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare results of a clinical scoring system for diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis with microbiologic results, when several different pharyngeal pathogens were tested simultaneously. DESIGN: Evaluation of clinical manifestations of 106 adult patients with pharyngitis of different microbial origin. SETTING: General private practice; Health Center Pulssi, Turku, Finland. PATIENTS: Adult patients whose chief complaints were sore throats. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A symptom score that was assigned to each patient according to the total number of certain signs and symptoms that are postulated to increase the probability of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and blood measurements for infection. RESULTS: The highest symptom scores, 3 and 4, were found in 21 patients. These patients had pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus (four patients), group C streptococcus (four patients), group G streptococcus (two patients), group F streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, herpes simplex type 1 virus (two patients), and coxsackie B4 virus. No pathogen could be identified from three of the 21 patients. The C-reactive protein values and the leukocyte counts were raised significantly more often in streptococcal infections than in infections of other origin; the P values were .00016 and .028, respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of a clinical scoring system alone for diagnosis of pharyngitis may lead to improper use of anti-microbial agents. There is a need for accurate microbiologic diagnostic procedures in general practice to determine proper treatment of pharyngitis as well as to test the effect of antibacterial and, in the future, antiviral treatment in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Cefprozil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. It is particularly active against the Gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. Cefprozil is also moderately active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, many Enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. In comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. Cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. In children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. Thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. While cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - Global surveillance of bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor: 1988-1990.
AB  - In vitro data on bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor were collected from clinical trials conducted in 15 European countries, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. Among the respiratory pathogens, 94% of Haemophilus influenzae, 98.6% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 98.8% of Streptococcus pyogenes, and 98.1% of Moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to cefaclor. Over 90% of the tested isolates of the most common urinary tract pathogen, Escherichia coli, were susceptible to cefaclor. Virtually all of the pathogens that may infect skin and soft tissues, S pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains), were cefaclor susceptible. These data confirm that the major pathogens in bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, of the skin and related structures, and of the urinary tract remain susceptible to cefaclor after more than 13 years of widespread clinical use.
TI  - Contributions of post-antibiotic lag and repair-recovery to the post-antibiotic effects of ciprofloxacin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ciprofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either one or four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. PAE were demonstrated with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes after exposure to either concentration for both times. No clear PAE was demonstrated for Klebsiella pneumoniae after any treatment. In some cases, PAE was due to an increased post-treatment lag phase, which was followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag was followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being much less than those of the corresponding drug-free controls. This is evidence of recovery of cells that have completed DNA repair. S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumoniae all exhibited evidence of this type of repair even though K. pneumoniae gave no significant PAE. However, the post-treatment generation times of S. pyogenes, which produced the greatest PAE, gave no evidence of such repair. It is concluded that PAEs may result from a variety of factors.
TI  - Subperiosteal orbital abscess in children: diagnosis, microbiology, and management.
AB  - A chart review was undertaken of 30 patients who were presented to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1983 to 1990 and underwent surgical management for suspected subperiosteal abscess of the orbit (SPA). All patients had preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans. Twenty-seven of 30 CT scans were reevaluated, of which 20 (74%) demonstrated findings consistent with or suggestive of SPA. Opacified sinuses were seen in 100% of this study group. Abscess collections were found in 21 patients (70%). Predominant organisms included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (38%), Streptococcus pyogenes (33%), and Haemophilus influenzae (14%); Moraxella catarrhalis was not isolated and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from only one patient. CT scans were found to be accurate predictors of SPA in 16 (80%) of 20 patients. All patients did well following surgical intervention without visual or central nervous system sequelae. We conclude from this study that CT scans should be obtained when SPA is suspected, and antimicrobial therapy should be directed toward the bacteria isolated from these abscesses.
TI  - Review of cefixime in the treatment of otitis media in infants and children.
AB  - During the past decade there has been an increase in the percentage of resistant  bacteria isolated from middle-ear effusions aspirated from infants and children who have had acute otitis media. At least nine oral antibiotics or combination agents are available for this indication. Cefixime, a third generation cephalosporin, has excellent in vitro activity against both beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes but relatively poor activity against Staphylococcus aureus. In children cefixime is similar in effectiveness to amoxicillin and cefaclor, but diarrhea and stool changes are more common with cefixime. Amoxicillin is still preferred for initial empiric treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media. Its major drawback is limited efficacy when beta-lactamase-producing bacteria are the causative organisms. Cefixime is a viable alternative to amoxicillin for infants and children with acute otitis media when: (1) a beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis is isolated from otorrhea or tympanocentesis; (2) the child has a history of delayed hypersensitivity to the penicillins but no history of hypersensitivity to the cephalosporins; (3) there is a high incidence of resistant bacteria in the community; (4) there is not clinical improvement with amoxicillin; or (5) once daily administration is more convenient.
TI  - Microbiologic and clinical aspects of a trial of once daily cefixime compared with twice daily cefaclor for treatment of acute otitis media in infants and children.
AB  - In this randomized, investigator-blinded multicenter study, tympanocentesis for acute otitis media with effusion in 137 ears from 108 children, 6 months to 12 years of age, revealed 84 definite pathogens and 32 potential pathogens. Twenty-nine aspirates from 23 subjects were sterile. Of the 116 isolates 42 (36%) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 24 (21%) were Haemophilus influenzae, 9 (8%) were Moraxella catarrhalis, 9 (8%) were Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 (1%) was Staphylococcus aureus. Twenty-two (19%) definite pathogens produced beta-lactamase. Patients were randomized to cefixime (8 mg/kg/day daily) or cefaclor (40 mg/kg/day divided into two doses). Efficacy was determined by pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry at the end of therapy visit on Days 11 to 14 and up to 4 weeks of follow-up. At end of therapy subjects with definite pathogens exhibited a satisfactory clinical outcome in 26 of 36 (72%) ears for cefaclor and 40 of 48 (83%) ears for cefixime recipients (P = 0.12). For ears with beta-lactamase-producing isolates there were no (0 to 12) cefixime failures but 4 of 10 cefaclor failures (P = 0.03). Diarrhea/loose stools were more frequent in cefixime (16 of 58) than cefaclor (4 of 50) recipients. One cefixime subject required discontinuation of drug. Overall efficacy for treatment of acute otitis media with effusion was not different; however, cefixime appeared more effective for infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - The binding of Pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid to human erythrocytes.
AB  - Previous studies have evaluated the binding characteristics of lipoteichoic acids (LTA) composed of polyglycerol phosphate to mammalian cell membranes. This present study was performed to evaluate the binding characteristics of Pneumococcal LTA, a polyribitol phosphate containing LTA, to human erythrocytes. Binding was found to be specific, reversible, and dependent on temperature and time. Maximum binding was achieved within 2 h at 37 degrees C. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding revealed a biphasic plot which suggests two receptor sites with different affinities. Competitive inhibition studies with LTA composed of polyglycerol phosphate and isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes and Lactobacillus fermentum revealed significant inhibition of Pneumococcal LTA-binding to the erythrocyte membrane by these heterologous LTAs. These results demonstrate that Pneumococcal LTA binds specifically to human erythrocytes and that the receptor site is similar for other structurally different LTAs.
TI  - Susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens in Finland to cefixime and nine other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefixime and 9 other orally used antimicrobial agents against 545 selected clinical respiratory tract pathogens was tested using the plate-dilution method. Of the strains tested, 144 were Haemophilus influenzae strains, 151 group A streptococci, 105 pneumococci and 145 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Ciprofloxacin was the most active drug, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of < 0.06 mg/l for more than 87% of the isolates. With cefixime, a MIC of 0.06 mg/l inhibited 55% of the strains tested and a MIC of 1.0 mg/l inhibited all except one of the 545 strains. One pneumococcal strain was resistant to cefixime. Beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis strains were clearly more susceptible to cefixime than to other oral cephalosporins (cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime). However, penicillin, ampicillin and cefuroxime were more effective against beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci than was cefixime. The new third generation cephalosporin, cefixime, showed markedly better in vitro activity against certain major respiratory tract pathogens than the other peroral antimicrobials commonly used against respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Role of serum antibodies to streptococci in patients with IgA nephropathy.
AB  - Serum antibodies to whole cells of streptococci and serum immune complexes were investigated in patients with IgA nephropathy accompanied by tonsillitis and in healthy adult controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum IgA levels to Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis I and S. pneumoniae were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. The levels of IgG to S. pyogenes T12, S. gordonii and S. sanguis II in patients with IgA nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. Serum immune complexes of IgG and IgA were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. Serum levels of IgA to some strains of streptococci tended to correlate with the level of IgA immune complex in both patients and healthy controls. These results suggest that antibodies to some strains of streptococci play a role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.
TI  - Cefdinir: in vitro activity study and effect of human serum.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefdinir (Cl-983, FK482), an orally absorbed aminothiazole cephalosporin, was compared with that of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (2/1), cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefotaxime, vancomycin and erythromycin against 370 clinical isolates of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Cefdinir was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, inhibiting 90% of the strains at doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively. However, cefdinir was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (range 16- > 128 mg/l). The respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes were also susceptible (MIC90 < or = 0.5 mg/l), but against Enterococcus spp. cefdinir displayed no useful activity. The common members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible (MIC90 < or = 1 mg/l), but those possessing chromosomal beta-lactamases were more resistant (MIC90 2-8 mg/l). The presence of human serum had little effect on MICs of cefdinir. These results indicate that cefdinir exhibited a wide spectrum for an oral cephalosporin and support its possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in infections of the skin, soft tissue, respiratory and urinary tracts.
TI  - [Occurrence of group (genus) specific Chlamydia antibodies in the blood of patients with tonsillo-pharyngitis].
AB  - A prospective study of 108 persons form Novi Sad population aged from 1 to over 40 years with tonsylopharingitis, showed that in 21.3% of the throat smears pyogenic streptococcus was present. In the blood serum, both in streptococcus positive and streptococcus negative subjects we confirmed the presence of antistreptosolin-0-antibodies. The occurrence of these antibodies was higher (p < 0.05) in streptococcus positive patients, especially in those aged from 1 to 14 years. On the basis of simultaneously proved presence of group (genus) specific antibodies to Chlamydia organisms in 26.8% of the patients, in titre value > or = 1/64, the authors point to the necessity of further systematic studies on etiologic role of Chlamydia pneumoniae in the development of acute tonsylopharingitis.
TI  - Streptococcal erythrogenic toxin genes: detection by polymerase chain reaction and association with disease in strains isolated in Canada from 1940 to 1991.
AB  - The presence of genes encoding pyrogenic exotoxins type A (speA), B (speB), and C (speC) and streptolysin O (slo) was determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to target specific sequences in 152 strains of group A streptococci. These included reference strains, representative M and T type strains, and strains associated with scarlet fever and pharyngitis collected between 1940 to 1991 and included strains from patients with severe invasive streptococcal infections. PCR amplicons were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, and specificity was established by restriction fragment analysis. The frequency of occurrence for each target gene among all strains tested was 33.6% for speA, 99.3% for speB, 28.9% for speC, and 100% for slo. Strains of non-group A streptococci, recognized toxigenic bacterial pathogens, and pneumolysin-producing Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were negative for all targeted gene sequences. Detection limits in the PCR were found to be 100 pg of total nucleic acids for the speB and speC genes and 1 ng for the speA and slo genes. Isolates associated with scarlet fever, pharyngitis, and severe invasive infections showed statistically significant differences in the presence of speA, with scarlet fever strains having the highest association (81.3%), severe infections the next highest association (42.9%), and pharyngitis the lowest association (18.4%). Although no significant differences were observed in speC frequencies in isolated associated with the three disease categories, a genotype of speB slo was significantly higher in isolates associated with pharyngitis (54.1%) than in strains associated with scarlet fever (18.8%) or severe invasive disease (23.8%). Streptolysin O targets were present in all the isolates tested, and only a single strain (T-11-M-11) was devoid of targeted speB sequences, thereby demonstrating that neither speB nor slo is associated with any particular clinical presentation.
TI  - [Significance of normal oral flora, particularly group oral streptococci as defense mechanism against infection in healthy individuals (normal defense mechanism by oral Streptococcus group)].
AB  - The alpha-streptococci, consisted of normal oral flora mainly, with inhibitory activity against pathogenic microbes in healthy individuals was investigated by group A Streptococcus (indicator strain 6-22 nonmucoid T-12). Rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against group A Streptococcus was increased as aging, and the rate in pre-school children was higher than that in school children. These results suggested that more than 90% of the tested alpha-streptococci with strong inhibitory activities (S. salivarius) against indicator strain had inhibitory activities against group A Streptococcus (mucoid T-6), H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, group C Streptococcus, and from 40% to 70% of the tested strains had also inhibitory activities against other pathogens. As there were many strains of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activities against pathogens, that usually detected in the upper respiratory infection, the problem on the strains in the future will explain significance of the defense mechanism against upper respiratory infection and this can be applied clinically.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefprozil granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ), a newly developed oral cephalosporin in a fine granular form for pediatric use, was administered to children with bacterial infections. MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFPZ, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) against the following 84 strains isolated from cases to which CFPZ was administered; 55 strains of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 49 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 29 strains of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) including 10 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. MIC determination of these strains was done with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. In pharmacokinetic studies, serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were investigated using bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). CFPZ was orally administered 30 minutes before meals to 9 children with ages ranging from 7 years and 1 month to 12 years and 3 months. Three groups of 3 children were tested with doses of 4.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg, respectively. In addition to the above, clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 160 cases consisting of children with ages ranging 5 months to 12 years and 5 months. A mean dose of 8.6 mg/kg in 3-4 divided doses (130 cases of t.i.d. and 30 cases of q.i.d.) was administered for an average of 7 days. The 160 cases included 34 cases of pharyngitis, 5 cases of tonsillitis, 8 cases of acute bronchitis, 8 cases of pneumonia, 52 cases of scarlet fever, 4 cases of acute purulent otitis media, 47 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis and 1 case of posthitis. Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined in 166 cases, including 6 cases excluded from the evaluation of clinical efficacy. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. With regard to GPC, MICs of CFPZ against 2 strains of S. aureus were 0.78 or 1.56 micrograms/ml and CFPZ showed the second highest activity to MCIPC. MICs of CFPZ against 49 strains of S. pyogenes were all less than 0.025 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - [Overall clinical evaluation of cefprozil against infections in pediatric fields. Pediatric Study Group for Cefprozil].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100) granule preparation was studied for pharmacokinetic,  bacteriological and clinical aspects in the pediatric infections. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion. The pharmacokinetics of CFPZ in pediatrics was investigated by single oral administration of fine granules at doses of 4.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg. Peak blood levels of CFPZ were 3.06, 4.62 and 9.65 micrograms/ml, respectively, at 1.00-1.30 hours after each dose and AUCs were 7.44, 12.50 and 27.01 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. These data showed that Cmax and AUC depended on dose levels. T 1/2 (beta) at these dose levels were 1.03, 0.94 and 1.01 hours, respectively. There were no differences related to dose. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration were 51.5-57.1%. The pharmacokinetics of CFPZ before or after meals were also investigated at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg. Peak blood levels were 4.88 micrograms/ml at 1.17 hours after administration in the fasting state, and 4.30 micrograms/ml at 1.54 hours after administration in the non-fasting state. Delay of Tmax and slight decrease of Cmax were observed in the non-fasting state, but T 1/2 and AUC were 0.91 hour and 12.96 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively, in the non-fasting state, and were similar to those in the fasting state, 0.93 hour and 12.82 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration were 63.8% in the fasting state and 50.7% in the non-fasting state. 2. Clinical results. Clinical efficacies of CFPZ granules in various infectious diseases were studied in 804 cases. Twenty nine cases, mostly viral or mycoplasmal infections, were excluded from the statistical analysis. The clinical efficacy rate in 527 cases with causative bacteria isolated was 97.2%; and in 248 cases from whom no significant isolate had been obtained was 96.0%. The clinical efficacy rate in 475 cases with monobacterial infections (proven by culture of isolates) was 97.3%, and that in 52 case with polybacterial infections was 96.2%. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated mostly from acute respiratory infections. In 88 cases from whom H. influenzae was isolated, clinical efficacy rate was 95.5%. In cases from whom H. influenzae was found concomitant by with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae, the clinical efficacy rates were also high. The bacteriological eradication rate in cases with 582 strains was 83.3%; the eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 95.8%; and for Gram-negative organisms, it was 64.2%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CFPZ were determined upon oral administration of CFPZ after meal at doses of 4 mg/kg granules in a case, 7.5 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 15 mg/kg granules in one. Peak serum levels of CFPZ were obtained at an hour in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.7-8.6 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.69-0.95 hours. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 59.4-71.3%. 2. MICs of CFPZ against 36 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 5, Streptococcus pyogenes 5, Escherichia coli 5, Haemophilus influenzae 12, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 4, and Branhamella catarrhalis 1) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL) and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFPZ was superior to those of CCL against Gram-positive cocci, and to those of ABPC against E. coli, and was equal to those of CCL and inferior to those of ABPC against H. influenzae. 3. Thirty-seven pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (pharyngitis/tonsillitis 17, bronchitis 7, pneumonia 3, skin and soft tissue infection 2, and urinary tract infection 8) were treated with CFPZ at daily doses of 10-47 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 56% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case and elevated GOT, GPT values in 2 cases.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefetamet against clinically isolated microbial strains collected from urban RTI patients].
AB  - The authors studied antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (CFMT) and other leading oral antimicrobials of beta-lactam class against clinically isolated strains from urban respiratory tract infection (RTI) patients from January to March, 1992. 1. CFMT showed potent antimicrobial activities against "3 primary pathogens" of RTIs i.e., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, but the drug had a slightly higher MIC than those of a few oxime-type cephems already on the market. 2. CFMT was as stable as cefixime to beta-lactamase, generated by Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, which reduces the antimicrobial activity of cephems. 3. Blood concentrations of CFMT after administering cefetamet pivoxil (CFMT-PI), an oral form of the drug, exceeded the MIC80 against the "3 primary pathogens" as well as M. (B) catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, for a duration of approximately 9 and 11 hours, respectively, after single doses of 250 and 500 mg. This suggests that CFMT could remain above the MICs for a sufficient time period with twice daily dosages of normal dose levels. 4. It is concluded that CFMT-PI will be useful for treating urban RTIs.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activity of RU 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester HR 916.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. The MICs of RU 29246 for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for Morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and Proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). RU 29246 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to RU 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. RU 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM-1 and SHV-1). However, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9) was detected. Results of the study suggested that RU 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
TI  - In vitro postantibiotic effect of roxithromycin and erythromycin against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A persistent suppression of bacterial growth following a brief exposure to an antibiotic (postantibiotic effect [PAE]) has been described for a variety of antibiotics and microorganisms. Data concerning PAE have not yet been demonstrated in Taiwan. In this study, the PAEs of erythromycin (EM) and roxithromycin (RXM) against 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 of Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 of Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested. Dilution method was used for removal of drugs. Two controls, one free of drug and one in 1/1000 of the original drug concentrations were used. The results showed that the PAE lasted longer in strains of S. aureus (RXM 1.7-2.1 h; EM 1.7-2.1 h) and S. pyogenes (RXM 1.7-3.0 h; EM 1.9-2.9 h) than those in S. pneumoniae (RXM 0.6-1.6 h; EM 0.8-1.4 h). There was no difference of PAE between RXM and EM against each bacterial strain tested.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in Streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Surface proteins of Streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. The reason for this is not clear. The present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. The results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of S. mutans NG8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a pH-dependent manner with optimal release at pH 5 to 6. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. Two proteins, adhesin P1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. The release of adhesin P1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, Cu2+,Zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. The inhibition by heat and Cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-p-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of P1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. Adhesin P1 from Cu(2+)-inactivated S. mutans NG8 protoplasts could be released by mixing with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a P1-negative mutant of NG8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. This P1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of S. mutans and one strain each of S. gordonii, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes. The biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. However, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from various bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. Some of the highly purified LTAs, in particular LTAs from Bacillus subtilis, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. As after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these LTAs reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. Other purified LTAs, i.e., LTAs from Streptococcus sanguis, S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from Micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native LTA from S. aureus was inactive. There was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of LTAs. Deacylation of LTAs resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated LTAs did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of LTA to the cell surface. The results demonstrate that some LTA species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.
TI  - Antibacterial profile of flurithromycin, a new macrolide.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of flurithromycin against common respiratory tract Gram-positive (85 strains) and Gram-negative (44 strains) pathogens, and a collection of anaerobes (125 strains) was compared with that of erythromycin, cefixime, amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and clindamycin. Flurithromycin possessed the same spectrum and potency of antimicrobial activity as erythromycin. The presence of 50% human serum in the test media enhanced the activity of flurithromycin against all isolates, with the exception of Streptococcus pyogenes. Flurithromycin induced a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) that ranged from 0.25 h (Haemophilus influenzae) to 3.5 h (Streptococcus pneumoniae) for all strains tested. The presence of serum increased or diminished the duration of the PAE, depending on the strain being analysed. No interaction between flurithromycin and the other drugs tested was observed by the checkerboard technique, but when the time-kill system was used, 35 cases of synergy were noted out of 120 tests performed (29%), of which 15 (43%) were with Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (34%) with Staphylococcus aureus, four (11%) with H. influenzae and the remainder with S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Netilmicin produced most synergic interactions. Antagonism was not detected by either methods.
TI  - In-vitro stimulation of TNF-alpha from human whole blood by cell-free supernatants of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are being recognized increasingly as the cause of shock-like syndromes, clinically indistinguishable from those seen in association with Gram-negative endotoxic shock. Much clinical and experimental data link tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with the pathogenesis of endotoxic shock, and a number of studies of individual Gram-positive species have also implicated TNF-alpha. We report here the first systematic study of the ability of cell-free supernatants of common Gram-positive bacteria to induce TNF-alpha from human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro. Almost all the 63 strains were able to induce TNF-alpha, although the levels were substantially lower than those obtained from supernatants of Gram-negative bacteria, used as controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, viridans streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci were consistently more active than group B and D streptococci. TNF-alpha induction did not correlate with conventional markers of pathogenicity; amongst strains of Staphylococcus aureus, commensal and blood culture isolates did not induce significantly different amounts of TNF. We conclude that cell-free supernatants of most Gram-positive bacteria are capable of inducing TNF-alpha from human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro, but the significance of this finding remains to be determined.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone after oral doses of 400 and 800 mg.
AB  - The plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, OPC-17116,  was determined after once-daily oral ingestion of 400 mg and 800 mg in normal, healthy volunteers. OPC-17116 at a 400-mg dose produced plasma bactericidal titers greater than or equal to 1:16 at 12 hours against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. OPC-17116 bactericidal titers against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1:2 or 1:4 at 6 and 12 hours. The plasma bactericidal titers against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1:4 or greater, but bactericidal titers against Staphylococcus aureus were 1:2 at 12 hours and less than 1:2 at 24 hours. The 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 produced bactericidal titers of at least 1:32 at 12 hours for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, and Moraxella, and 1:4 for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, but bactericidal titers against S. aureus were 1:2. These data would suggest that an 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 taken orally once daily would provide adequate concentrations to treat infections due to the pathogens examined in this study.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-74,667. A new fluoroquinolone compared with other quinolones.
AB  - CP-74,667, a 6-fluoro-7-bridged piperazinyl-1-cyclopropyl-4 quinolone, inhibited  90% of staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of 4 micrograms/ml and an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. CP-74,667 was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and St. pyogenes, but equal or less active than tosufloxacin against Gram-positive species. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa was 5 micrograms/ml similar to temafloxacin. The CP-74,667 MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 2 micrograms/ml, equal to tosufloxacin and temafloxacin. Activity was eight- to 16-fold less at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.4 and also eight- to 16-fold less in urine. Magnesium ions markedly increased the CP-74,667 minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). The development of resistance to CP-74,667 was similar to that found for other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Postantibiotic sub-MIC effects of vancomycin, roxithromycin, sparfloxacin, and amikacin.
AB  - The sub-MIC effects (SMEs) and the postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA SMEs) of vancomycin, roxithromycin, and sparfloxacin for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and of amikacin for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated. A postantibiotic effect was induced by exposing strains to 10x the MIC of the antibiotic for 2 h in vitro. After the induction, the exposed cultures were washed to eliminate the antibiotics. Unexposed controls were treated similarly. Thereafter, the exposed cultures (PA SME) and the controls (SME) were exposed to different subinhibitory concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x the MIC) of the same drug and growth curves for a period of 24 h were compared. In general, the PA SMEs were much more pronounced than the SMEs. However, for amikacin and E. coli the SME of 0.2 and 0.3x the MIC also had an initial bactericidal effect. The longest PA SMEs were demonstrated for the combinations with the most pronounced killing during the induction and for the combinations which exhibited the longest PAEs.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of spiramycin and erythromycin in acute exudative tonsillitis in adults: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - A randomized control trial was designed to compare the efficacies of spiramycin given one gram twice daily and erythromycin given 500 mg thrice or four times daily in the treatment of acute exudative tonsillitis in adults whose ages were over 13 years old from January 1989 to January 1991 at a community clinic. A total of 120 cases were enrolled in the study. Fifty-three patients received spiramycin while 67 received erythromycin. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), S. aureus, and positive titer of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were detected in 19, 47 and 8 per cent in spiramycin group and 21, 36 and 11 per cent in erythromycin group respectively. GABHS were totally eradicated on day 3 of treatment in both groups through eradication of S. aureus was slightly slower initially in the spiramycin group. Marked improvement was similarly achieved in both groups after 3 days of therapy. Dyspepsia was felt in 34.4 and 8.2 per cent of erythromycin and spiramycin groups respectively but was tolerable by most patients. We concluded that spiramycin given twice daily was as effectively as conventional erythromycin but spiramycin is more convenient to administer and causes much less gastro-intestinal side-effect.
TI  - The crisis in antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The synthesis of large numbers of antibiotics over the past three decades has caused complacency about the threat of bacterial resistance. Bacteria have become resistant to antimicrobial agents as a result of chromosomal changes or the exchange of the exchange of genetic material via plasmids and transposons. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococci, organisms that cause respiratory and cutaneous infections, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas families, organisms that cause diarrhea, urinary infection, and sepsis, are now resistant to virtually all of the older antibiotics. The extensive use of antibiotics in the community and hospitals has fueled this crisis. Mechanisms such as antibiotic control programs, better hygiene, and synthesis of agents with improved antimicrobial activity need to be adopted in order to limit bacterial resistance.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Microbiological considerations of the etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - One hundred eight-four sputum specimens from the same number of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship between the microorganisms isolated and the presumptive pathology. The sputa were subdivided into three groups; "high probability", "low probability", and "contaminated sputa", following the criteria of the microscopic readings: sputum with more than 25 white cells and low numbers of squamous epithelial cells represents true lower respiratory tract infections (high probability); those with fewer than 25 white cells represent non-bacterial infections or non-infected sputa (low probability) while sputa with more than 25 squamous cells per field represent contaminated specimens (contaminated sputa). Statistical analysis was carried out to correlate these data. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes showed significant differences in the three groups considered.
TI  - [Quantitative analyses of the normal throat flora of children with upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Relationship between the normal throat flora and pathogenic bacteria recovered from the throat in 139 children with upper respiratory tract infections in winter were studied using quantitative analyses. Pathogenic bacteria examined include S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae, and the normal floras include alpha-streptococci, gamma-streptococci, Neisseria species, and Micrococci. Children with S. pyogenes in their throats (S. pyogenes group) were examined with anti-streptococcal antibodies such as anti-streptolysin O, anti-streptokinase, and anti-deoxyribonuclease B. Eighty seven pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 72 children (51.8%) out of 139. S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae groups showed significantly lower alpha-streptococci and gamma-streptococci in incidence of appearance when compared with children with the no pathogenic bacteria in their throats (no bacteria group). H. influenzae group showed significantly lower gamma-streptococci and higher Neisseria sp. in incidence of appearance compared with the no bacteria group. Positive cases for anti-streptococcal antibodies showed a significantly lower alpha-streptococci in number compared with negative cases for antibodies and the no bacteria group, and a significantly lower gamma-streptococci in incidence of appearance compared with the no bacteria group. These data suggest that the normal throat flora may have a role in prevention of colonization by the pathogenic bacteria in vivo, as were shown in vitro by many authors, and that the quantitative analysis of the normal flora is useful because this methodology might reveal whether the bacteria recovered from the throat show the pathogenicity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. Two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. The two compounds displayed similar activities. The MIC90s of RP 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L in 114 strains of Staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). Similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. RP 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L for Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 20), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (MIC90, 8 mg/L). In view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, RP 59500 merits further investigation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefdinir (CI-983; FK-482) against staphylococci, gram-negative bacilli and respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir (CI-983; FK-482), a new oral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates of staphylococci, gram-negative bacilli and common respiratory tract pathogens. Cefdinir (MIC90 less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) was more active than cefixime (MIC90 greater than 64 micrograms/ml) and equally as active as cefuroxime (MIC90 2.0 micrograms/ml) against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. Cefdinir was active against Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase producers (MIC90 0.5 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) and Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml). The activity of cefdinir against gram-negative bacilli was variable; organisms with chromosomal cephalosporinases were often resistant.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of the new streptogramin RP 59500.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of RP 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. A 30 min exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a PAE of 3.2-8 h. A 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a PAE of 2.5-7.5 h. PAEs of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the PAEs of highly susceptible isolates. A 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 7.5-9.5 h for Streptococcus pneumoniae and a PAE of greater than 18 h for Streptococcus pyogenes. RP 59500 produced a longer PAE with Staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. These results suggest that RP 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, RP 59500, RP 57669 and RP 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  - RP 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of RP 57669 and RP 54476. The activity of RP 59500 and its two components against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. RP 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/L (range 0.06-2 mg/L). Both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of S. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. Streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group C and G streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/L. Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/L. The MIC90 was 4 mg/L for Haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/L for Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59500 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of RP 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. Clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were Bacteroides spp. RP 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. MBCs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, compared with MBCs in broth, but RP 59500 was as active at pH 6 as at pH 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. RP 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of Gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - In vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. A review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values (microgram/mL) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; M. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; Escherichia coli, 2.0-25; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; Streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; S. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. The in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. This is particularly true with H. influenzae. Furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.
TI  - Criteria for evaluation of antimicrobial agents and current therapies for acute sinusitis in children.
AB  - Acute sinusitis is a common complication of upper respiratory tract infections in children. The primary causative bacteria are Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Concurrent viral infection may confound interpretation of the clinical response to antimicrobial treatment. First-line antimicrobial treatment is usually with amoxicillin. The increase in frequency of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in some communities, however, may warrant empirical treatment with other drugs such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefixime, or cefuroxime. With the marketing of newer antimicrobial drugs for treating sinusitis, it is important for physicians to understand the criteria for evaluating the efficacy of each new drug in relation to existing antimicrobial agents. Criteria for clinical and bacteriologic evaluation of new antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of sinusitis in children are described.
TI  - Parameters characterizing the in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, against respiratory and urinary pathogens.
AB  - The wide and potent in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, has been confirmed on a collection of respiratory and urinary pathogens recently isolated in Italy. The new cephem emerged as the most bactericidal of all the comparators tested against several fast as well as slowly-growing gram-negative species including Enterobacteria, Haemophilus and Moraxella, irrespective of their ability to synthetize beta-lactamases. Among the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were effectively covered. Cefixime activity was not adversely influenced by several important variables such as pH (over the range from 5 to 8), inoculum size (from 10(5) to 10(8) CFU per ml) and the presence of 50% human serum or urine. Time-kill tests confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of the drug especially towards common respiratory pathogens (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes). Killing of urinary strains was optimal at cefixime concentrations reached in urine since eradication, except for Proteus mirabilis, was enhanced with increasing levels of the drug. The absence of an untoward paradoxic effect on the rate of cefixime bactericidal action was confirmed by employing a dynamic bladder model simulating the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single 200 mg daily dosage. Interactions of cefixime with several other drugs that may be employed in combination therapy were generally prone to provide indifference and synergism while antagonism was never observed. Favorable interactions were also registered when cefixime acted with other antibiotics on partially resistant species such as Staphylococci and Pseudomonas. The new cephem seems to provide excellent opportunities for expanding oral cephalosporin therapy to a wide range of infections produced by susceptible pathogens in the adult and pediatric populations.
TI  - [Acute suppurative thyroiditis and Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. A case report and review of the literature].
AB  - The acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare infection. It affects specially patients with preexisting thyroid gland pathology and its frequency is higher in women. In childhood it's linked to local anatomic defects. The infection used to be located in left thyroid lobe and it's much less usual in right lobe, in both or in isthmus. The most important causal microorganisms are staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus overcoat) and streptococci (usually Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae), with frequent isolation of mixed flora and anaerobes in the last reported cases. We present the case of a male patient, without previous thyroid disease, who suffered an acute suppurative thyroiditis and Sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, with right lobe abscess and secondary septic focus formation (kidneys, spleen, lungs), with fatal course despite of medical treatment, favoured or precipitated by the development of serious alcoholic abstinence.
TI  - Sporeamicin A, a new macrolide antibiotic. III. Biological properties.
AB  - Sporeamicin A is a new erythromycin-type antibiotic isolated from a species of Saccharopolyspora. It was active in vitro against a wide variety of Gram-positive bacteria. In vitro studies indicated that the sporeamicin A was stable in the presence of human serum, although it was bound to serum proteins. Sporeamicin A was effective in the mouse protection test against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Sporeamicin A attained higher plasma and tissue levels in the rat than did erythromycin stearate.
TI  - The effect of roxithromycin on the virulence of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Antibiotics whose recognized mode of action comprises inhibition of bacterial protein biosynthesis are also recognized to modulate the expression of bacterial virulence factors when incorporated into culture media at sub-MIC levels. In this respect, one of the new macrolides, roxithromycin, has been examined for its effect on toxin/enzyme production by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Biosynthesis of staphylococcal coagulase and DNase could be potentiated, whereas that of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, streptolysins O and S, and pneumolysin were unaltered. Expression of one structural virulence factor, pneumococcal polysaccharide, was repressed in the drug's presence, resulting in potentiation of phagocytic ingestion of the drug-exposed bacteria. The drug failed to have any effect on ingestion of Staph. aureus or Strep. pyogenes. These studies provide evidence that roxithromycin may exhibit "added value" as an antibiotic in its ability to potentiate the susceptibility of Strep. pneumoniae to host defenses such as phagocytosis.
TI  - [Studies on panipenem/betamipron in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in pediatrics were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a combined drug of a carbapenem antibiotic (panipenem) and organic ion inhibitor (betamipron) at a weight ratio of 1:1. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion were studied when PAPM/BP, at 10 mg/10 mg/kg (4 cases) or 20 mg/20 mg/kg (5 cases), was administered using intravenous drip infusion in 30 minutes to 9 children (4-14 years old). The plasma PAPM level at the end of drip infusion was 30.75 +/- 4.98 micrograms/ml in the cases administered with 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 68.72 +/- 5.73 micrograms/ml in the cases administered with 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Drug concentrations then gradually decreased with half-lives of 1.08 +/- 0.09 hours and 0.98 +/- 0.02 hour, and reached 0.39 +/- 0.14 micrograms/ml and 0.62 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively, after 5.5 hours. Plasma BP levels at the end of drip infusion was 18.93 +/- 3.75 micrograms/ml in the cases administered 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 37.09 +/- 2.68 micrograms/ml in the cases administered 20 mg/kg, and half-lives were 0.55 +/- 0.07 hour and 0.61 +/- 0.03 hour, respectively; the plasma BP level could not be determined in any cases after 5.5 hours. Mean urinary recovery rates of PAPM in the first 6 hours after the start of intravenous drip infusion were 33.0 +/- 6.1% in the cases administered 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 21.8 +/- 2.3% in the cases administered 20 mg/20 mg/kg and those of BP were 77.0 +/- 2.4% and 76.6 +/- 7.3%, respectively. 2. When PAPM/BP, was administered at 31.3 mg/31.3 mg/kg thought by intravenous drip infusion in 30 minutes to 1 case of purulent meningitis, PAPM levels were 0.76 micrograms/ml at the end of drip infusion but varied between 0.80 to 1.97 micrograms/ml 30 minutes after the end of drip infusion during 8 days of treatment. 3. PAPM/BP was administered to 43 cases, 47 diseases of bacterial infections in the domain of pediatrics to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions. Single doses were 5.2mg/5.2mg to 31.3 mg/31.3 mg/kg; frequencies of administration were 3 to 4 times a day, and durations of administration were 3 1/3 to 11 days; and total dosages ranged between 1.125 g/1.125 g and 11.0 g/11.0 g.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bactericidal titers of loracarbef (LY 163892) in serum and killing rates in volunteers receiving 400 versus 200 milligrams.
AB  - In a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (LY 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. Mean +/- standard error of the mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. Bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). Other species (Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. Killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/MIC ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the MIC. Our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial quantification--a necessary complement for the comprehension of middle  ear inflammations.
AB  - Quantification of bacteria in various types of middle ear effusion (MEE) obtained during current acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (COM) was performed. The bacteria were stained with acridine orange and their number per ml effusion evaluated under the fluorescence microscope according to a method described in detail elsewhere. During AOM, 53% of the MEE samples were culture-positive and contained 10(6)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 10(7) per ml). During OME, serous effusion and 78% of the mucoid effusions contained no bacteria whatsoever, whereas the remaining mucoid effusions contained 10(4)-5 x 10(5) bacteria per ml (median value 10(4) per ml). Mucopurulent effusions contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 5 x 10(6) per ml). During COM, purulent MEE had 6 x 10(6)-10(9) bacteria per ml (median value 10(8) per ml). Quantification of bacteria involved in middle ear diseases provides further information about the etiopathogenesis and appropriate management of various pathological conditions of the middle ear.
TI  - [Current status on the epidemiology of acute pharyngitis and post-streptococcal syndromes].
AB  - So far, no ideal study providing an exhaustive knowledge of acute pharyngitis epidemiology has been carried out. What is available now is a number of investigations, all with deficiencies, which concern the duration of the disease (there may be seasonal variations), its limits in space and, above all, the number of pathogens sought for. A well-organized investigation span over at least one year, involve a fairly wide range of age-groups and be repeated in several countries. Bacterial epidemiology is dominated by beta-haemolytic streptococci group A, but other streptococcal groups, notably group C, have been incriminated. Other responsible bacteria, such as Haemophilus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Corynebacterium spp., are extremely rare but most probable. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and perhaps Chlamydia pneumoniae are probably found more frequently. Rheumatic fever--which had virtually disappeared in medically advanced countries due to a higher level of life and to the general use of penicillin therapy--has reappeared in recent years, as shown by a few North-American epidemics. Such epidemics have come on time to remind us that we should be vigilant and continue, as in the past, to treat all streptococcal foci systematically, in order to prevent the occurrence of rheumatic fever.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of MDL 62,873, a semisynthetic derivative of teicoplanin,  in vitro and in experimental infections.
AB  - MDL 62,873 is an amide derivative of teicoplanin A2-2. Like those of natural glycopeptides, its antibacterial activity is mediated by inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Against streptococci and enterococci, the in vitro activity of MDL 62,873 was similar to that of teicoplanin and greater than that of vancomycin. Against staphylococci, it has activity similar to that of vancomycin, and it was significantly more active than teicoplanin against coagulase-negative isolates. Like teicoplanin and vancomycin, MDL 62,873 had slow but significant bactericidal activity (99 to 99.9% killing in 24 h) against staphylococci at concentrations near the MIC. In murine septicemia studies with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, the 50% effective doses were lower than those of vancomycin. In staphylococcal endocarditis in rats, MDL 62,873 at 20 mg/kg of body weight and vancomycin at 40 mg/kg, both doses given intravenously twice daily, had similar efficacies in reducing the heart bacterial load. These results probably reflect the longer half-life of MDL 62,873, which has a pharmacokinetic profile in rats similar to that of teicoplanin.
TI  - Effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  - In vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (NHU). Primary cultures of NHU cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in F-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS). Optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of NHU cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in F-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% BPE) and 0.05% BSA. Results indicated that insulin in the F-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less IGF-1. Further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that PGE1 is growth stimulatory and can replace BPE as a growth factor requirement. This finding was in agreement with the fact that BPE growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl cAMP. These results suggested that both BPE and cholera toxin operated by activation of a cAMP-dependent mitogenic pathway. Seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (LT) were tested for their effects on NHU clonal growth. Three out of the five LPS derived from Escherichia coli (strains 055:B5, 0128:B12, and 0127:B8), LPS from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. LPS derived from E. coli strain (0111:B4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). In contrast, LT derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureas, and Bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [LT] less than 50 micrograms/ml. LT from Strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. The growth inhibitory effects of LPS were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that LPS effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. We speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by LPS produced by gram-negative bacteria. However, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. The growth-stimulating activity of LTs produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. Meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Against Gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. It inhibited all 330 strains of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. Meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an MIC90 of 0.78 mg/l. The therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. From the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae in the presence of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis.
AB  - We measured the sizes of the inhibition zones of oral beta-lactam antibiotics for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing-Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis by the agar double-layer method. The sizes of the zones of amoxicillin for S. pneumoniae alone were the largest, followed in a descending order by those of cefixime and cefaclor. In the presence of 10(7) CFU/ml of M.(B.) catarrhalis, however, significant reduction of the sizes of the zones was seen with amoxicillin and cefaclor; inhibition with cefixime was nearly unchanged. Similar results were observed in those for S. pyogenes. These variable findings were attributed to the difference in stability of these drugs to the beta-lactamase produced by M.(B.) catarrhalis. When the susceptibility of H. influenzae in the presence of 10(8) CFU/ml of M.(B.) catarrhalis to cefixime, cefoteram, cefpodoxime, cefotiam and cefuroxime was examined, the sizes of the inhibition zones of all the drugs were reduced by the presence of 10(8) CFU/ml of M.(B.) catarrhalis, but those of cefixime were the largest of all the drugs tested. Our agar double-layer method is simple and useful for evaluating the influence of beta-lactamase-producing organism, as M.(B.) catarrhalis, on the disk susceptibility of other pathogens to antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of 5% and 10% granules of  cefdinir in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482),  a new oral cephalosporin, 5% and 10% granules, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of CFDN against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied in comparison with those of cefaclor (CCL), cefixime (CFIX) and amoxicillin (AMPC). MIC80's of CFDN against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae and E. coli were 0.78, 0.20, less than or equal to 0.025, 0.39, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results show that CFDN has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. MIC80's of CFDN against Gram-positive bacteria were similar to those of AMPC, and was lower than those of CCL and CFIX. As for antibacterial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), the MIC80 of CFIX against H. influenzae was 0.05 micrograms/ml, which was slightly lower than that of CFDN. THe MIC80's of CFDN against other GNB were similar to those of CFIX. 2. Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of CFDN 5% and 10% granules and 100 mg capsule were determined. The data on CFDN 10% granules were similar to those on CFDN 5% granules. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, peak blood concentrations (Cmax's) of CFDN ranged from 0.20 to 2.12 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and from 0.50 to 1.15 micrograms/ml with 10% granules at 2 to 3 hours after dosing. At a dose of 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 0.66-2.06 micrograms/ml and 0.70-1.52 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and with 10% granules, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, blood concentrations were 0.04-0.54 micrograms/ml at 3 mg/kg and 0.06-0.27 micrograms/ml at 6 mg/kg. Blood half-lives were 1.33-4.36 hours at 3 mg/kg and 1.14-3.27 hours at 6 mg/kg. AUC's were 1.7-11.0 micrograms.hr/ml with 3 mg/kg and 2.4-8.7 micrograms.hr/ml with 6 mg/kg. With administration of single 100 mg capsule, Cmax's, blood concentrations after 8 hours, T1/2's and AUC's were 0.79-1.88 micrograms/ml, 0.20 micrograms/ml, 1.54-2.72 hours, and 5.2 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours ranged from 6.85 to 39.2% with 3 mg/kg and 6.08-25.5% with 6 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in otitis prone children treated with immunoglobulin.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate possible beneficial effects of regularly given, long term immunoglobulin prophylaxis of children below 2 years of age with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM). The nasopharyngeal bacterial flora and the frequency of acute otitis media (AOM) and secretory otitis media SOM were studied. Every second of 44 children with 3 or more periods of AOM during the last year received immunoglobulin intramuscularly (Gammaglobulin Kabi 165 mg/l, 0.45 ml/kg b.w.) every third week for 6 months, while the other 22 children served as controls. All children were followed for 12 months. Immunoglobulin prophylaxis neither influenced the nasopharyngeal flora, nor the frequency of AOM or SOM periods. Children with AOM or SOM more often harbored bacterial pathogens in their nasopharynx than children with normal middle ear status. Also, the immunoglobulin prophylaxis did not influence the increased frequency of bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx of children attending public day care or family day care as compared to those taken care of at home.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of upper respiratory tract pathogens in Sweden: a seven year follow-up study including loracarbef. Swedish Respiratory Tract Study Group.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated in five different geographical areas of Sweden in 1990 and compared with results from similar investigations performed in 1983 and 1986. Tests on 100 isolates per species and laboratory were performed by the disk diffusion method, and 10% of the strains plus all resistant ones were sent to the central laboratory for determination of MICs of ampicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, cefaclor, loracarbef, erythromycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Beta-lactamase production was found in 7% of H. influenzae and 71% of M. catarrhalis, and reduced susceptibility to penicillin in 3% of S. pneumoniae. Low frequencies (1-3%) of tetracycline resistance were found in H. influenzae and in the 2 streptococcal species, in which also less than 1% of the strains were resistant to erythromycin. Resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole occurred in 7% (range 3-14%) of H. influenzae and in 3% of S. pneumoniae. Cefaclor was active against all streptococci except against S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin. It was active against beta-lactamase negative strains of M. catarrhalis but had, according to the SIR-system, intermediate activity against H. influenzae. Loracarbef was twice as active as cefaclor against H. influenzae but equally active against the 3 other species tested.
TI  - [Preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  - The authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (IFP) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. The infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (Micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with IFP as well as in recommended standard media. Solid media used for cultivation of S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and C. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. All of these strains grew on the media prepared with IFP except S. pneumoniae when cultured in IFP diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. Only S. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. No more differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. The growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis was measured in liquid media after 8 hours. In solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in IFP-agar and Nutriente Agar by the number of colonies on Trypticase soy agar plates. Some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated in standard media. The average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of IFP was 5.03 mg/ml. The experiments showed that culture media prepared with IFP supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. It suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.
TI  - The comparative activity of fleroxacin, three other quinolones and eight unrelated antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin, a new trifluorinated quinolone was evaluated against 432 bacterial isolates. Fleroxacin was 1- to 2-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and at least as active as ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The MICs of fleroxacin for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml against all isolates of Enterobacteriaceae except Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) and Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). Fleroxacin was as active as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against Pseudomonas spp, (MIC90 for all quinolones tested were > 8 micrograms/ml). Acinetobacter and Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to fleroxacin; however fleroxacin was 1-fold less active than lomefloxacin against Acinetobacter and at least 1-fold less active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against H. influenzae. Methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-susceptible strains of S. aureus were very susceptible to fleroxacin, with an MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml (range 0.5-1 microgram/ml). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus spp. other than aureus and epidermidis were not susceptible to fleroxacin (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). In addition, fleroxacin as well as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were inactive against Enterococcus spp. (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were resistant to both fleroxacin and lomefloxacin but were very susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. These results suggest that fleroxacin represents a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by most Enterobacteriaceae and some species of staphylococcus.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Evaluation of the bactericidal activity of temafloxacin.
AB  - Although the fluoroquinolones share many properties, these agents differ in their ability to kill the same bacterial strain. The bactericidal activity of temafloxacin against a number of pathogens has been compared with that of other fluoroquinolones by determination of minimal bactericidal concentration, time-kill kinetics, and postantibiotic effect. Studies have demonstrated that temafloxacin has equivalent or superior ability to kill when compared with other fluoroquinolones. Temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and PD 117558 were more active than other fluoroquinolones against Mycobacterium avium complex, with 90% minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC90S; 8-16 micrograms/mL) four- to eightfold greater than 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC90S; 2 micrograms/mL). Against Chlamydia trachomatis the MIC90 and MBC90 of temafloxacin were both 0.25 microgram/mL; ciprofloxacin was less active (MBC90 twice the MIC90), and norfloxacin was least active. Temafloxacin demonstrated more rapid killing kinetics than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin at all concentrations tested against Streptococcus pyogenes. Findings were similar against Streptococcus pneumoniae at antibiotic concentrations of 1-2 micrograms/mL. Similar time-kill curves against Escherichia coli were observed for temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and difloxacin. Time-kill kinetics of temafloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) were superior to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Postantibiotic effect with temafloxacin against Legionella pneumophila showed a considerable delay in regrowth, and temafloxacin delayed regrowth of MRSA and MSSA to a greater extent than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. By the three methods used in the studies to assess bactericidal activity that are currently published, temafloxacin had equivalent or superior activity to the comparative fluoroquinolones tested. Other organisms remain to be tested and the significance of these findings determined in clinical studies.
TI  - Stimulation of monokine production by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) isolated from bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes, were tested for their ability to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in cultured human monocytes. LTAs from S. aureus and S. pneumoniae failed to induce monokine production when applied in the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/ml. However, LTAs from several enterococcal species (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) induced the release of all three monokines at levels similar to those observed after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The kinetics of IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha release elicited by LTAs closely resembled those observed following lipopolysaccharide application. Cytokine production occurred in the presence of both fetal calf serum and autologous human serum. Hence, it was not dependent on complement activation and could not be suppressed by naturally occurring human antibodies. Deacylation caused the total loss of monocyte stimulatory capacity. Deacylated LTAs were unable to prevent monocyte activation by intact LTAs, so primary binding of these molecules probably does not involve a simple interaction of a membrane receptor with the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. The results identify some species of LTAs as inducers of monokine production in human monocytes.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of clarithromycin and its 14-hydroxy metabolite against Haemophilus influenzae and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity of clarithromycin in six normal human volunteers  was determined after oral doses of 500 mg. The mean plasma levels of clarithromycin plus 14-hydroxy clarithromycin were 2.11 micrograms/mL after the second dose and 4.36 micrograms/mL after the sixth dose. The mean serum bactericidal titer against Haemophilus influenzae after the second dose was 1:8 and after the sixth dose 1:16 when unheated serum was used. Similar values were obtained when serum to which clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy clarithromycin was added was tested. Mean serum bactericidal titers against H. influenzae determined in Haemophilus test broth or heated serum were 1:2 and 1:4, respectively. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, there was greater than 1:16 serum bactericidal levels at 12 hours after the sixth dose of clarithromycin.
TI  - [Bactericidal effect of cefadroxil, amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid in sera of healthy volunteers].
AB  - Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) provides data on the susceptibility or resistance of a bacteria; however, in susceptible bacteria this parameter is not predictive of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent. Bactericidal activities of cefadroxil, of amoxicillin, and of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on bacteria commonly found in ENT and lower respiratory tract disease were studied comparatively. The antibiotics were given by the oral route to six healthy volunteers. With beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, amoxicillin produced MICs consistent with susceptibility but failed to exhibit a bactericidal effect, whereas cefadroxil was bactericidal. Combination of amoxicillin with an inhibitor did not modify this activity on E. coli and failed to produce a bactericidal effect on Klebsiella pneumoniae similar to that seen with cefadroxil. Amoxicillin with and without clavulanic acid exhibited comparable effectiveness on Streptococcus pyogenes and S. Pneumoniae. The bactericidal effect of cefadroxil on S. pneumoniae was of similar magnitude but shorter duration than that of amoxicillin. Cefadroxil and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination had similar bactericidal effects against Staphylococcus aureus. These antibiotics exhibited a time-dependent effect on Gram positive microorganisms. These pharmacodynamic data, together with measures of bactericidal activity, may be very helpful for selecting the appropriate antibiotic and dosage.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefdinir 5% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical evaluation in pediatrics on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) (5% fine granules), a new oral cephem, was performed. 1. CFDN was administered to 112 pediatric patients with ages between 1 month to 13 years with various infections. Dose levels used were 3.0-8.9 mg/kg (mean 5.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-14 days (mean 6.7 days). The studied patients included 2 patients with scarlet fever, 6 with acute pharyngitis, 6 with acute rhinopharyngitis, 52 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 8 with acute bronchitis, 24 with acute pneumonia, 7 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute vaginitis, and 6 with impetigo. Total doses ranged from 0.6 to 4.05 g. One hundred eleven of the 112 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy and all the patients were evaluated for safety. 2. Clinical effects were excellent in 51 cases, good in 57, and fair in 3 with an extremely high efficacy rate of 97.3%. Efficacy rates were 100% in scarlet fever, acute pharyngitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, acute vaginitis and impetigo, and 83.3%, 95.7%, 85.7% in acute rhinopharyngitis, acute pneumonia, and acute urinary tract infections, respectively. Good clinical effects were observed regardless of diseases. 3. Causative organisms were identified in 79 cases, of which 71 were found to be monobacterial infections and 8 were found to be multi-bacterial infections. In mono-bacterial infections, clinical efficacies were 100% for those caused by Staphylococcus aureus/Streptococcus pyogenes/Streptococcus pneumoniae/beta-Streptococcus except those in A and B groups with an overall efficacy of 100% against Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and they were 89.5%, 100%, 100% for those caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with an overall efficacy of 90.3% in Gram-negative rods (GNR). In multi-bacterial infections also, a clinical efficacy of 100% was obtained. 4. Bacteriological effects were studied for 89 strains in the 79 cases. The eradication rate for a few strains of S. pneumoniae was low, 25%, but it was 100% for S. aureus, with the same results for S. pyogenes, and beta-Streptococcus. The eradication rate on GPC was high 94.1%. Among GNR, 66.7% of E. coli, 50.0% of H. influenzae, and 71.4% of H. parainfluenzae was eradicated. The overall eradication rate for GNR was 55.3%, lower than that for GPC. Microbial substitutions were observed in 13 cases, with Haemophilus sp. replacing other bacteria. 5. Diarrhea and soft stools were noted in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. The severity of these side effects, however, was slight and it was possible to continue the CFDN treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical studies of cefdinir in pediatric infections].
AB  - Five percent fine granule preparation of cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) was administered  to 30 patients with acute febrile respiratory tract infections (RTI) at 4.9-21.1 mg/kg/day divided into 3 portions. And 10% fine granule preparation of CFDN was also administered to 11 patients with acute febrile RTI and 1 patient with urinary tract infection at 10.0-20.0 mg/kg/day divided into 3 portions. Good clinical effects observed in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) with acute pharyngitis, 12 of 13 patients (92.3%) with acute tonsillitis, 2 of 4 patients (50.0%) with pneumonia and a patient with urinary tract infection. From these patients, 34 causative organisms were isolated. Ten (83.3%) of 12 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 (46.2%) of 13 strains of Haemophillus influenzae and 1 strain of Escherichia coli were eradicated from these patients. Among the patients with pneumonia, CFDN 20 mg/kg/day dose group showed better clinical responses and better bacteriological effects against H. influenzae among the patients given CFDN 20 mg/kg/day dose group than those given CFDN 5 mg/kg/day dose group. Side effects were noted in 2 cases, one case had soft stools and the other had diarrheas.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of different beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated. A postantibiotic effect (PAE) was induced for different bacterial species by exposure to 10x MIC of several beta-lactam antibiotics for 2 h in vitro. The antibiotic-bacterial combinations used in this study were imipenem-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, benzylpenicillin-Streptococcus pneumoniae and -Streptococcus pyogenes, cefcanel-S. pyogenes, ampicillin-Escherichia coli, and piperacillin-E. coli. After the induction of the PAE, the exposed cultures as well as the unexposed controls were washed and diluted. Thereafter, the cultures in the postantibiotic phase (PA phase) and the cultures not previously treated with antibiotics were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x MIC of the relevant drug and the growth curves were compared. When bacteria in the PA phase were exposed to sub-MICs, a substantial prolongation of the time before regrowth was demonstrated, especially in antibiotic-bacterial combinations for which a PAE was found. In contrast, sub-MICs on cultures not previously exposed to suprainhibitory antibiotic concentrations yielded only a slight reduction in growth rate compared with the controls. Thus, it seems important to distinguish the direct effects of sub-MICs on bacteria not previously exposed to suprainhibitory concentrations from the effects of sub-MICs on bacteria in the PA phase.
TI  - [Bactericide activity of cefadroxil comparated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,  cefaclor and josamycin].
AB  - Betalactamase-producing organisms are responsible for an increasing number of ENT and lower respiratory tract infections. Or cephalosporins and the combination of amoxicillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid are alternatives to ampicillin therapy. The killing activity of cefadroxil on the organisms most often responsible for ENT and respiratory infections was evaluated in vitro using a viable bacteria count method, comparatively with cefaclor, josamycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Killing activity was found to be time-dependent for all the antimicrobial agents studied. Cefadroxil exhibited the same bactericidal effect on Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae than the other agents. Haemophilus influenzae and an increasing number of Pneumococcus strains were resistant to josamycin which is therefore not appropriate for first-line therapy. As compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefadroxil was less active on H. influenzae and more active on Staphylococcus aureus. Production of beta-lactamase failed to influence the killing activity of cefadroxil. These bacteriologic data, together with results of pharmacologic studies (long half-life and good penetration within tissues) can explain the clinical successes obtained with cefadroxil in ENT and lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140, and PD 131501). A quinolone with high activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140 and PD 131501) is a new antimicrobial agent of the  piperazinyl quinolone class. Relative to other quinolones, it is a potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal drug in vitro: The microbroth 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) (in microgram/ml) was 0.25 vs 26 methicillin-resistant and -sensitive coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci and 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae; 0.5 vs 20 strains each of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecalis. The data indicate sparfloxacin to be generally superior to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, cefazolin, doxycycline, amikacin, and vancomycin against these Gram-positive bacterial groups. Additional MIC90s were determined for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (less than or equal to 0.03); Enterobacteriaceae (0.5); and Listeria monocytogenes (1). Activity was generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic-anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium cholate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine. Naturally occurring resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of 10(-8) or lower.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout Japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (CPM), its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Microbial strains in which no CPM-resistant strains emerged were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. 2. In comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to CPM were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to CPM was observed in high ratios. 3. Among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that CPM could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "CPM-resistant strains". 4. It was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including CPM. 5. There are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of CPM to clinically isolated strains in recent years. However, it was jointly confirmed that CPM maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. Furthermore, when it was additionally considered that CPM was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that CPM was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - In vitro activity of YM133, a new semisynthesized macrolide.
AB  - YM133, the 4"-O-(4-methoxyphenyl)acetyltylosin, is a new macrolide. The in vitro  activity of YM133 was compared with those of erythromycin, josamycin, and rokitamycin by an agar dilution method. YM133 inhibited 90% of the tested isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella spp., and anaerobic bacteria at less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml. The drug inhibited 90% of erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes at less than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml. YM133 showed activity against erythromycin-, josamycin-, and rokitamycin-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml) strains of staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides spp., and Clostridium spp. Enterococci were less susceptible to other YM133-like macrolides. Unlike other macrolides, YM133 showed killing activity, and the MBC/MIC ratios of YM133 for several strains were 1:32, whereas those of erythromycin were 4:1,024. In a time-kill curve study, the reduction of viable cells started within 2 h after the addition of YM133.
TI  - [Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: occurrence in chronic liver disease patients  in Recife].
AB  - A prospective research was made on spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in chronic liver disease patients presenting with ascites. Forty clinical cases, of 37 patients, were analysed. All subjects were submitted to clinical and laboratory evaluation and diagnostic paracentesis, and the material was obtained for biochemical dosages, pH determination, cytology and bacterial cultures. Thirty cases of sterile ascites and 10 of SBP (25%) were detected. In 5 (50%) with SBP, the clinical findings were characteristic, with fever, abdominal pain and rebound tenderness. In 2 patients (20%) the presentation was atypical, without the complete triad described above. Finally in 3 (30%) SBP was silent, without any suggestive clinical manifestations of infection. In 7 cases (70%) cultures were positives; Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 cases), Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus negative coagulase, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one case each). In 7 (70%) SBP cases, the patients were admitted already infected in the hospital. Lethality in the SBP group was 30% and in the sterile ascites was 13.3%. We concluded that SBP is a frequent cause of morbid-lethality in patients with ascites and chronic hepatopathy, presenting itself often in a typical clinical manifestations.
TI  - Synthesis of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes of Ceclor (cefaclor) and preliminary experiments on their antibacterial character.
AB  - Cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes of the antibacterial drug Ceclor have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of their elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic moment and electronic and infrared spectral data. These complex have been, then subjected to screening for their antibacterial properties against bacterial species such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In comparison to uncomplexed Ceclor, the metal complexes have been shown to be more antibacterial.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  - The major pathogens causing acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. The same organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. In chronic suppurative otitis media, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S aureus are most frequently found. Antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating AOM are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. Currently, about 20% of AOM cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually H influenzae or M catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. Concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in AOM than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - [Effects of cefixime and cefaclor on pharyngeal flora in children].
AB  - Influences of cefixime and cefaclor, oral antibiotics, were studied in 50 children (age range, 11 months to 13 years) with pharyngitis. Daily doses of cefixime were 6 to 10 mg/kg in 25 children and those of cefaclor were 40 to 50 mg/kg in 25 children. Pharyngeal swabs were taken before and after 3 to 7 days of the antibiotic treatment. Pathogenic organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were isolated in 14 children before and in 1 child after cefixime use. But these bacteria were isolated in 15 children before and in 9 children, and 3 strains of H. influenzae and 3 strains of S. pneumoniae were newly isolated after cefaclor use. An isolation rate of Gram-negative bacilli, such as Acinetobacter spp., were increased after use of cefixime. In both antibiotics, isolation rates of yeasts were slightly increased. An isolation rate of alpha-hemolytic streptococci was increased from 16% to 48% by cefixime treatment and from 24% to 52% by cefaclor treatment. The MIC50 of cefixime and cefaclor against alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated after treatment was higher than that isolated before. Effects of cefixime and cefaclor was less extensive than that of ampicillin in previous reports.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221), a new cephem  developed by Hoechst AG and Roussel Uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. Against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to those of cefotaxime (CTX), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to that of CTX, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. Especially against Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. Although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by Salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. Bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of Salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). Especially S. pneumoniae in 10 cases, H. influenzae in 12 cases and B. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. Adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). Eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. As digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. In laboratory test values, elevation of GOT, elevation of GPT, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. Influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. No change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. From above results, we have concluded that CDZM is a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin.
AB  - Sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. It was less active than ciprofloxacin but more active than ofloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was less active than ciprofloxacin but twofold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and most Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates at 0.25 micrograms/ml, whereas ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin inhibited these isolates at 2 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Sparfloxacin was less active at an acidic pH and in the presence of Mg2+. Resistance to sparfloxacin was produced by repeated exposure, although the frequency of single-step mutants was less than 10(-9).
TI  - Activity of temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The activity of the quinolone temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. MICs for 90% of strains tested indicated that temafloxacin was at least two- to fourfold more potent than the other two quinolones against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Temafloxacin had potency equal to that of ciprofloxacin and was twofold more active than ofloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes. Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bordetella pertussis. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, temafloxacin was four- and twofold less potent than ciprofloxacin, respectively. When administered orally in mouse protection tests against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes, temafloxacin was at least eight times more potent than ciprofloxacin and was two to four times more active than ofloxacin. Against H. influenzae, temafloxacin was as active as ofloxacin and was two times less active than ciprofloxacin following oral administration in mice. In treating L. pneumophila in guinea pigs and H. influenzae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ofloxacin were more effective than ciprofloxacin. Against S. pneumoniae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active than ofloxacin. Following subcutaneous administration in mice, temafloxacin achieved higher lung levels than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin did.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826 compared to other glycopeptides and daptomycin.
AB  - LY264826 a new naturally occurring glycopeptide inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus at 1 micrograms/ml. LY264826 had similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. The LY264826 MIC90 for Streptococcus pyogenes was 0.25 microgram/ml, twofold more active than vancomycin and twofold less active than teicoplanin. LY264826 was eightfold more active than vancomycin and twofold more active than teicoplanin against enterococci. LY264826 inhibited Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 microgram/ml and Listeria monocytogenes at 0.5 microgram/ml. Clostridium were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml of LY264826 and peptococci, peptostreptococci, and Fusobacterium were inhibited by less than 0.5 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species were LY284826 -resistant as were all Enterobacteriaceae, Flavobacterium, and Neisseria spp. Minimum bactericidal and inhibitory concentrations (MBCs and MICs) were within a dilution for S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, but greater than or equal to 32-fold greater for enterococci.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Plants used in Guatemala for the treatment of respiratory diseases. 1. Screening  of 68 plants against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Respiratory ailments are important causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Ethnobotanical surveys and literature reviews conducted in Guatemala during 1986-88 showed that 234 plants from 75 families, most of them of American origin, have been used for the treatment of respiratory ailments. Three Gram-positive bacteria causing respiratory infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) were used to screen 68 of the most commonly used plants for activity. Twenty-eight of these (41.2%) inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria tested. Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by 18 of the plant extracts, while 7 extracts were effective against Streptococcus pyogenes. Plants of American origin which exhibited antibacterial activity were: Gnaphalium viscosum, Lippia alba, Lippia dulcis, Physalis philadelphica, Satureja brownei, Solanum nigrescens and Tagetes lucida. These preliminary in vitro results provide scientific basis for the use of these plants against bacterial respiratory infections.
TI  - [Polymicrobial endocarditis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus  pyogenes in a heroin addict carrying the human immunodeficiency virus].
AB  
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefixime in pediatric respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Cefixime (CFIX) was evaluated clinically in pediatric respiratory tract infections, particularly those caused by Haemophilus influenzae: 1. The total number of children in this study treated with CFIX was 232, out of which 215 cases were evaluated for clinical efficacy and 224 cases were investigated for safety. A daily dosage of 3-6 mg/kg/day was given divided into 2 to 3 times daily for 3-15 days. 2. Causative organisms were identified in 146 cases, out of which 128 cases were found to be single microbial infections and 18 cases were mixed infections. In single microbial infections, clinical efficacy was 100% for those caused by H. influenzae/Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and was 95% for Streptococcus pyogenes with an overall efficacy of 96.9%. In mixed infections, the clinical efficacy was 100% for those caused by a combination of H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the overall rate was 94.4%. An involvement of H. influenzae was observed in 108 cases with a clinical efficacy rate of 99.1%, and definite involvement of beta-lactamase secreting strains of H. influenzae was found in 32 cases with a clinical efficacy of 96.9%. 3. Bacteriological effect was studied for 164 strains identified in 146 cases, and eradication rates were 89.5% for H. influenzae, 100% for H. parainfluenzae and S. pyogenes, and 71.4% for S. pneumoniae. The overall eradication rate was 91.4%. Superinfection was observed in 21 cases. MICs against 78 strains of H. influenzae were in a range of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml regardless of beta-lactamase production, and far superior to cefaclor and amoxicillin. MICs against S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were in ranges of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. Clinical efficacy was 93.0% in 215 cases (excellent: 136, good: 64, fairly good: 10, poor: 5). CFIX attained a high efficacy in the range of 89.4-95.7% in acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, acute bronchitis and acute pneumonia. 5. Safety was monitored in 224 cases and there were only one case of loose stool and another of diarrhea as side effects. There were no abnormal findings in 31 cases of the laboratory test. In conclusion, it was confirmed that CFIX is excellent and safe in the treatment of the respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - The effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with Bacteroides species. Is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. Subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. Animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. Infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. Despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted organism. The combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of B. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of Bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with S. aureus and S. pyogenes. These findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia.
AB  - Results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. The sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. The resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. Brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. The resistance of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. The gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). Gentamicin and amikacin resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). Salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella species, and enteropathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Ninety six percent of Gram-negative rods except P. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. In addition, P. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.
TI  - Nasopharyngeal flora in otitis media with effusion. A comparative semiquantitative analysis.
AB  - An inflammatory process in the middle ear caused by bacteria or bacterial products emanating from the nasopharynx is one etiological factor considered in the unknown pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME). The nasopharyngeal prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes was studied in 191 children with defined OME and in 53 age-matched children without middle ear disease. Duplicate sampling and semiquantitative analysis were performed to assess even minor differences in the distribution of pathogens between the two groups of children. Pathogens were recovered in 91% of OME children. A significantly higher number of pathogen species/patient (1.66 vs. 1.15, p less than 0.01) as well as pathogen colonies/patient was found in OME children compared to control children. Chronic OME in children is associated with an increased pathogen load in the nasopharynx, suggesting a role of these pathogens in the etiology of OME.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of carbamate-linked dual-action antibacterial Ro 24-4383.
AB  - Ro 24-4383 contains desacetylcefotaxime linked by a carbamate bond at the 3' position to ciprofloxacin. Ro 24-4383 was active against 99% of the 363 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes tested in vitro, while the comparative agents cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were active against 77 and 97%, respectively. The activities (ED50: mg/kg s.c.) of Ro 24-4383, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in systemic murine infections were: Escherichia coli 257, 1.4, less than 0.5, less than 0.2; Klebsiella pneumoniae A, 11, 30, 0.7; Enterobacter cloacae 5699, 3.2, 35, less than 0.2; Citrobacter freundii BS16, 3, 41, less than 0.5; Serratia marcescens SM, 35, greater than 100, 1.6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5712, 67, 100, 10; P. aeruginosa 8780, 33, 193, 3; Staphylococcus aureus Smith (oxacillin-susceptible), 12, 3.7, 1; S. aureus 753 (oxacillin-resistant), 28, greater than 100, 2; Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301, 10, 15, greater than 50, and S. pyogenes 4, 3.3, 1.6, 54. Ro 24-4383, although inactive against the S.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia following one administration of the agent, was highly active (ED50 = 1.5) when three treatments were given following infection. Ro 24-4383 was active against the K.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia (ED50 = 37), as well as the meningitis induced by S. pneumoniae (ED50 = 158) or K. pneumoniae (ED50 = 100). The protective effect of Ro 24-4383 was demonstrated when administered 8 h before infection with E. coli (ED50 = 37) and 4 h before infection with S. pyogenes (ED50 = 199).
TI  - Cefixime shows good effects on group A and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - There is continued interest in the development of oral beta-lactam compounds, which can be used clinically to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci. Cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cefixime is highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. In this study the authors examined the effects of this molecule on Group A and Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci, recently isolated from clinical specimens in the authors' laboratory. MICs and the growth curves of 36 strains of Group A streptococci and the effects of sub-MICs on buccal cell adhesion were evaluated. The results show that concerning the sub-MIC cefixime effect on streptococci adherence, the treatment led to a decrease in adherence to the cells of the strains studied. Moreover cefixime showed good activity with 86.1% of the strains with MIC less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, and the growth curves demonstrated that the molecule possesses a bactericidal effect after 3 h. Concerning Group B streptococci, 70.3% of the strains showed a MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. In conclusion cefixime demonstrates good activity on beta-haemolytic streptococci, particularly those of Group A.
TI  - Bronchial hyperresponsiveness and bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  - Some studies suggest a potential role for bacterial respiratory tract infections  in the development of bronchospasm and the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis have exaggerated airway reactivity; croup in children can also cause exaggerated upper and lower airway responsiveness. Bronchial obstruction after inhalation of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacteria has been reported. Between January 1989 and June 1990 we and two other centers studied 193 patients suffering from acute exacerbation of asthma. Fifty-two (27%) of these patients had bacteria in their sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, and H influenzae were the most commonly isolated bacterial species. Antibiotics may be of value in the treatment of infective lung disease, not only by killing bacteria but also by preventing increases in bacterial histamine levels within the lung airways. Moreover, an antibiotic of proven efficacy can reduce airway reactivity in patients with bacterial exacerbations of COPD or bronchial asthma. In 12 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of asthma and high airway reactivity to methacholine, a ten-day course of treatment with cefaclor and existing bronchodilators induced microbiologic cure and a slight but nonsignificant change in airway reactivity in nine patients. Antibiotic therapy has a minor but clear role in the control of acquired bronchial hyperreactivity during bacterial respiratory infections in asthmatic patients; however, because of airway inflammation, an antibiotic's efficacy is evident only when the inflammatory process subsides. Approaches designed to minimize airway reactivity may contribute to the prevention or reversal of respiratory failure during exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin and six reference antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was assessed against 234 gram-positive bacterial isolates by agar dilution (10(4) CFU/spot). Sparfloxacin activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and five other antibiotics. Sparfloxacin was the most active drug tested against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 0.125-0.25 mg/l). Sparfloxacin was also the most active drug tested against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 mg/l) and showed equal activity against gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-resistant (MIC greater than 2,000 mg/l) enterococci. Sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes (MIC90, 1 mg/l). Most Corynebacterium jeikeium showed exquisite susceptibility to sparfloxacin (MIC, 0.06-0.25 mg/l). For MRSA, time-kill curves showed sparfloxacin to be rapidly bactericidal at the MIC of the organism. Sparfloxacin showed greater and more sustained bactericidal activity than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin at 1x and 2x the MIC. Reduction in the activity of sparfloxacin occurred with decreased agar pH (from 7.0 to 6.0) and increased bacterial inoculum. Sparfloxacin showed superior activity compared to reference drugs against most gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - [Study on susceptibilities of freshly isolated strains to macrolide antibiotics].
AB  - Macrolide (ML) susceptibilities of clinically isolated bacteria obtained freshly  during 1989 were determined and year to year differences in ML-resistances of the clinical isolates in our laboratory were examined with epidemiological consideration in mind. 1. The distribution of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MLs against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus showed 2 peaks, one peak representing S. aureus isolates susceptible to MLs and the other peak representing those resistant to MLs. Proportions of resistant isolates to various MLs were 36% to erythromycin, 24% each to kitasamycin, josamycin, midecamycin and midecamycin acetate. MICs of rokitamycin (RKM), however, distributed themselves into 3 peaks of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml (76%), 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml (12%) and greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml (12%). Staphylococcus spp. including Staphylococcus epidermidis showed different resistance characteristics to 14-membered ring MLs and to 16-membered ring MLs. Further, the proportion of resistant organisms to RKM was the smallest among proportions of resistant organisms to various 16-membered ring MLs tested. These differences in proportions of resistant organisms to different MLs may have resulted from differences in resistance induction activities of different MLs. The above described ratios of resistant organisms to MLs among S. aureus did not vary since 1975 among clinical isolates tested in our laboratory. 2. Four per cent (4%) of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were MLs resistant, and 18% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to MLs. Among the isolates tested in our laboratory since 1985, resistant isolates of S. pyogenes are clearly decreasing and those of S. pneumoniae seem to be increasing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The sore throat. When to investigate and when to prescribe.
AB  - Sore throats are most commonly due to infections, many of which are viral and do  not require specific treatment. Symptoms and signs of the common cold, influenza or croup, the occurrence of conjunctivitis in some adenoviral infections, generalised lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in glandular fever or the presence of vesicles characteristic of herpangina (Coxsackie A virus) or of herpes simplex infection, occasionally enable a clinical diagnosis and avoid the need for antibiotic therapy. In the case of treatable conditions a typical membrane may suggest diphtheria, a scarlatiniform rash infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes or to Corynebacterium haemolyticum, and a cherry-red epiglottis Haemophilus influenzae type b. Associated atypical pneumonia suggests infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae. Pharyngitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae may be accompanied by infection at other sites or by other sexually transmitted diseases. Candidal infection, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, should suggest HIV infection. Surgical drainage is required in the case of peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. Noninfectious cases of sore throat, e.g. thyroiditis, are relatively uncommon considerations in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile pharyngitis. The most common problem is to recognise streptococcal pharyngitis, which requires antibiotic treatment for 10 days to avoid the risk of rheumatic fever.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) and other antimicrobial agents against staphylococci, enterococci, and respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) was compared with those of other antimicrobial agents against isolates of staphylococci, enterococci, and various respiratory tract pathogens. Sparfloxacin was the most active drug tested against staphylococci (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.125 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml). It was also active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.125 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), and Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml).
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - Causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pharyngitis.
AB  - Pharyngitis is a common disease of the respiratory tract that can be caused by several different viruses and bacterial organisms. Clinically speaking, the most important causative agent is group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Although rare, postpharyngitis complications arise as a result of disease caused almost exclusively by group A streptococcus. Because group A streptococcal pharyngitis usually responds well to antimicrobial treatment, it is important to diagnose it. Penicillin, erythromycin, and peroral first-generation cephalosporins have been documented to be effective. In addition to group A streptococcus, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae have also been detected in patients with pharyngitis. The possibility of diagnosing these organisms is limited at the present. Clinical surveys are still needed, moreover, to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the disease caused by these organisms. Although routine viral diagnostic methods do not help primary care physicians in treating patients with pharyngitis, information on bacteria and viruses in the immediate environment could prove to be of great help in daily clinical work.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of the cloned M6 protein gene from Streptococcus pneumoniae to Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The host-vector system omega 6001-pDP36 was used to transfer the M6 protein gene  (emm-6.1) of Streptococcus pyogenes to other S. pyogenes strains, isogenic and nonisogenic to D471, the strain from which emm-6.1 was originally cloned. The first step was to subclone emm-6.1 into the insertion vector pDP36. The resulting plasmid, pRMB20, was used as donor in transformation to insert emm-6.1 into the conjugative transposon omega 6001. Streptococcus pneumoniae DP1322, carrying omega 6001 integrated into the chromosome, was the recipient in the transformation experiment. omega 6001 containing emm-6.1 was then transferred by conjugation from S. pneumoniae to the chromosomes of M+ and M- S. pyogenes strains. S. pyogenes transconjugants contained one intact copy of emm-6.1 integrated into the chromosome, but no expression of M6 protein could be detected by Western blot analysis. We found no evidence of the positive transacting regulation of emm gene expression postulated by other authors. In fact, the cloned emm-6.1 was not expressed in three strains expressing their own M proteins (M5, M17 and a shorter M6). In these partial diploids M protein genes were expressed only when present in the original chromosomal locus.
TI  - Changes in tonsillar bacteriology of recurrent acute tonsillitis: 1980 vs. 1989.
AB  - Recurrent acute tonsillitis is a common problem. Despite this, there still remain many controversies regarding aetiology and correct management. The tonsillar microflora of 33 children with recurrent acute tonsillitis studied in 1980 and 58 patients studied in 1989 is presented. A comparison of the microbiology in the two periods studied a decade apart suggests that the pathogenic profile is changing. Haemophilus influenzae increased from 39 to 62% in the deep tonsillar tissue in the decade. There was a concomitant increase in incidence of Staphylococcus aureus from 6 to 40% of cases. In the same interval, mixed microflora increased from 18 to 52%. Anaerobic organisms were isolated in insignificant numbers. Unique to this study, 44% of H. influenzae isolates in 1989 were beta lactamase producers, increasing from only 2% in 1980. All of the S. aureus were beta lactamase producers. In the majority, the throat swabs grew only organisms commensal to the upper respiratory tract however, the deep tonsillar tissue excised at tonsillectomy carried significant growths of pathogenic organisms confirming the inadequacy of the superficial tonsillar swab as an indicator of treatment.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Regulation of human monocyte/macrophage function by extracellular matrix. Adherence of monocytes to collagen matrices enhances phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria by activation of complement receptors and enhancement of Fc receptor function.
AB  - In inflammation monocytes emigrate from the peripheral circulation into an extravascular area rich in extracellular matrix proteins. In this milieu, phagocytes ingest and kill invading pathogens. In the present studies, we found that monocytes adhered to type I collagen gels phagocytized 2.5-12-fold more opsonized Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae than plastic-adherent monocytes. The rate of phagocytosis and the number of bacteria ingested by collagen-adherent monocytes was equal to, or greater than, the number of bacteria ingested by 7-d cultured macrophages (M phi). Although both collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes were bactericidal for E. coli and S. aureus, more bacteria were killed by collagen-adherent monocytes by virtue of their enhanced phagocytic capacity. Cultured M phi only were bacteriostatic. Adherence of monocytes to collagen gels activated C receptors (CR) types 1 and 3 for phagocytosis, and enhanced Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated phagocytosis. Collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes produced equivalent amounts of superoxide anion in response to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan. Thus, the enhanced phagocytosis and killing of opsonized bacteria by collagen-adherent monocytes appear to be by regulation of the function of membrane CR and FcR, without apparent enhancement of the respiratory burst. These data suggest that adherence of monocytes to the extracellular matrix during inflammation may rapidly activate these cells for enhanced phagocytic bactericidal activity.
TI  - Comparative study on the macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin: antibacterial activity and influence on immune responses.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin and clarithromycin (a new macrolide antibiotic) on clinical bacterial isolates as well as their effects on the cellular and humoral immune responses in BALB/c-mice and on human granulocytes/monocytes was investigated. Treatment of BALB/c-mice for 7 days with these drugs did not influence the delayed type hypersensitivity to oxazolone nor the production of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins. In vitro, exposure of granulocytes to erythromycin resulted in increased phagocytosis only in higher concentrations (20 mcg/ml), whereas clarithromycin enhanced chemiluminescence response of granulocytes in concentrations ranging from 2.5-20 mcg/ml. Subinhibitory concentrations of both substances modified Staphylococcus aureus and made them more susceptible for granulocyte phagocytosis.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY v 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY v 3522 was compared with the activities of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. MICs (in micrograms/ml) of BAY v 3522 were as follows: Staphylococcus spp. (except for oxacillin-resistant strains), 0.13 to 1; Streptococcus spp. (except for some viridans group streptococci), less than or equal to 0.015 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 to 8; other enterococci, 0.5 to greater than 32; beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, 0.13 to 1; beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, 0.5 to 4; Pasteurella multocida, 0.06 to 0.25; and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5 to greater than 32. Among the cephalosporins, BAY v 3522 was the most active against gram-positive cocci and cefixime was the most active against gram-negative bacilli; BAY v 3522 was similar in activity to amoxicillin-clavulanate against most species.
TI  - In vitro activity of dirithromycin (LY 237216) compared with activities of other  macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Dirithromycin inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other hemolytic streptococci at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml, with 90% inhibition at 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is comparable to results using erythromycin. Group A streptococci, listeriae, and enterococci resistant to erythromycin were resistant to dirithromycin. Erythromycin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but for erythromycin-resistant isolates MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. For Haemophilus influenzae, MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold greater than for erythromycin. The activity of dirithromycin against staphylococci and streptococci was not decreased by the addition of human serum.
TI  - [Annual changes in susceptibility of clinical isolates to midecamycin acetate].
AB  - To investigate annual changes in the susceptibility of clinical isolates to midecamycin acetate (MDM-AC), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MDM-AC were determined for clinical isolates obtained from outpatients since 1985. MDM-AC-resistant strains of Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. have shown similar degrees of resistance to midecamycin and josamycin. Regarding this as macrolide resistance, proportions of macrolide-resistant strains tended to increase for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae but to decrease for Streptococcus pyogenes. 1. For S. aureus, 8% of the strains isolated in 1985, 20% in 1987 and 20% in 1989 were macrolide-resistant. Of these macrolide-resistant strains, 70% or more in 1987 and 80% or more in 1989 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). 2. For S. pneumoniae, 8% of the strains isolated in 1985, 12% in 1987 and 12% in 1989 were macrolide-resistant, indicating a tendency for resistant strains to increase annually. 3. For S. pyogenes, 8% of the strains isolated in 1985, 4% in 1987 and 0% in 1989 were macrolide-resistant, showing a decreasing tendency. 4. MDM-AC is still thought to be a clinically useful antibacterial agent because it still shows antibacterial activity against 80% or more of Gram-positive cocci clinically isolated in recent years and a low degree of induction of macrolide resistance in Staphylococcus spp.

TI  - Cardiovascular infections: bacterial endocarditis of oral origin. Pathogenesis and prophylaxis.
AB  - The diagnosis infective endocarditis describes infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and indicates the presence of micro-organisms in the lesion. In most cases, the heart valves are affected, but the disease can also occur on septal defects or on the mural endocardium. The disease has been classified as acute or subacute based on the progression of the untreated disease. The acute form has a fulminant course with high fever and leukocytosis with death in less than 6 weeks. It is most often associated with infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes. The subacute (death within 6 weeks to 3 months) and chronic (death more than 3 months) forms are mostly described together. These forms usually occur in patients with prior valvular disease and are characterized by a slow, indolent course with low-grade fever, night sweats, and weight loss. This form is usually caused by the viridansstreptococci. The above mentioned classification does not include the nonbacterial forms of endocarditis and enterococci often give rise to a disease intermediate between acute and subacute endocarditis. It is preferable to have a classification based on the micro-organism responsible since this classification has implications for the course followed and the appropriate antimicrobial agent to use. The clinical manifestations of the disease are so varied that they may be encountered in most medical subspecialities. Successful management is also dependent on the close cooperation of medical and dental disciplines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - Quantitative study of wound infection in irradiated mice.
AB  - Bacterial infection of simple wounds was studied directly and quantitatively in adult mice given 6.5 Gy 60Co. Three days later, when neutropenia was evident, the skin and the medial gluteus muscle of anaesthetized mice were incised. A suspension of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes was inoculated into the wound. Bacteria per mg muscle were enumerated 3, 4 or 7 days later. The geometric means of bacteria per mg were greater in irradiated than in non-irradiated mice. Phagocytic cells were present in the wounded tissue. Hence sublethal ionizing radiation enhanced the susceptibility of mice to infections of wounds by these four bacterial species.
TI  - [The detection of streptococcal cell-wall proteins that form complexes with human macroglobulins].
AB  - The composition of the extracts of the cultures of individual streptococcal strains, studied by immunoblotting techniques, has been shown to contain proteins with a molecular weight of 70-80 KD. These proteins have pronounced affinity to human macroglobulins: alpha-macroglobulin, alpha-glycoprotein associated with pregnancy and protein A. The significance of this phenomenon on the cellular and somatic levels is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
AB  - Twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. Fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against Streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, Corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and Pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. Only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. Antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited to inhibition of Phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.
TI  - [Investigation of the immune response in tonsillar lymphocytes against streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP). In order to determine their immune response to S. pyogenes T4, S. pyogenes T12, S mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP, CT, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. Blastoid transformation was investigated by [3H] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. Tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin G following the addition of S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II S. mitis, S. pyogenes T4, and S. pyogenes T12, while those form CT patients and controls did so only with S. pyogenes T4 and S. pyogenes T12. 2. The spontaneous production of specific IgG against various streptococci, including S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP was already higher than that from CT patients and controls. The specific IgM production was also increased above that in PPP patients without any antigens. 3. S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific IgM production in tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients. 4. The levels of specific IgG production against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II by tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the PPP patients. These results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially S. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-S. sanguis antibodies in patients with PPP, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of PPP.
TI  - [Clinical examination of ceftibuten in acute bronchitis].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of ceftibuten (CETB, 7432-S) was performed in 20 patients with acute bronchitis. They were consisted of 10 males and 10 females aged from 20 to 80 years old. CETB was given orally in daily dose of 300 mg (18 cases) or 600 mg (2 cases) in three divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 to 14 days. Especially they were given for 7 days in 16 cases. A total of 11 strains comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of beta-Streptococcus and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii were identified from sputa before administration. All of the above bacteria were eradicated but, in 1 case, a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes appeared after the treatment (eradication ratio = 100%). The clinical efficacy rate was 100%: Responses were excellent in 3 cases and good in 17 cases. There was no side effect and no abnormal changes in laboratory test results. From the avobe results, it is concluded that CETB is effective, safe and useful new oral cephem on acute bronchitis.
TI  - [Investigation of the bacterial flora in the tonsillar lacunae and serum levels of streptococcal antigen-specific antibodies in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP). Since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with PPP, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. In this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated in 15 adult patients with PPP and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (CT). In addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with PPP, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. A total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with PPP, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with CT. 2. S. salivarius and S. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients with PPP or CT. 3. Although the rates of isolation for Staphylococcus and S. pneumoniae were lower in PPP patients than in CT patients, the rate for S. sanguis I was higher in PPP patients than in CT patients. 4. The percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in PPP patients was higher than in CT patients. 5. The IgG antibody titers against S. sanguis and S. mitis, and the IgM antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in PPP patients were higher than those in both CT patients and controls. 6. Moreover, both the IgG antibody titers against S. pyogenes T4 and S. sanguis I and the IgM antibody titers against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II of the patients in which PPP markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which PPP showed less improvement postoperatively.
TI  - [Activity of cefuroxime against bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media].
AB  - The acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. The treatment of this disease is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. The activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. These strains were: 112 strains of H. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of S. aureus; 14 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, and 32 strains of corynebacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. The MICs of cefuroxime against H. influenzae were low and similar (MIC 50 = 1 mg/l; MIC 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. Overall, 90% and 98% of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. These results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in general practice.
AB  - With the addition of several new oral antibiotics to those already available, there is the implication that bacterial resistance has become a significant problem in general practice. To test this hypothesis it is worth examining the susceptibilities of the major bacterial pathogens isolated from community based infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - Presence of chromosomal elements resembling the composite structure Tn3701 in streptococci.
AB  - Tn3701, carried by Streptococcus pyogenes A454, is the first chromosomal composite element to be described; it contains in its central region Tn3703, a transposon similar to Tn916. A comparison by DNA-DNA hybridization of Tn3701 with omega(cat-tet) and Tn3951, carried by Streptococcus pneumoniae BM6001 and by Streptococcus agalactiae B109, respectively, revealed that the two latter structures are also Tn3701-like composite elements. The DNAs of 27 other antibiotic-resistant group A, B, C, and G streptococci and of S. pneumoniae BM4200 showed sequence homologies to Tn3701 (14 strains, including BM4200), to the regions of Tn3701 outside of Tn3703 (5 strains), and to Tn916 alone (8 strains). The DNAs of five strains did not detectably hybridize with any probe. The tetM gene was identified in most chromosomal genetic elements coding for tetracycline-minocycline resistance. Since Tn3701-like elements are widely disseminated among antibiotic-resistant streptococci (47% of the 34 strains studied), we propose that Tn3701 be considered the prototype of chromosomal composite elements.
TI  - Bacterial findings in middle ear effusion in children.
AB  - During 1983-87, tympanostomy tubes were inserted in a total of 4952 ears of 2575  children remitted to the ENT Department of our hospital because of chronic or recurrent otitis media problems. The children were included in a prospective study and referred to one of three groups for comparison of findings. Group 1 included all 6- to 12-month-old infants undergoing primary tube treatment; group 2, all children 1 year or older who had their first ventilation tube(s) inserted in connection with adenoidectomy; and group 3, all children in whom tympanostomy had been performed one or more times previously. Middle ear effusion was aspirated from 2392 ears (48%); 67.6% of all ears were negative for bacteria and 22.1% of the ears with effusion grew pathogenic bacteria. S. pneumoniae was the most frequently cultured pathogen among the 6 to 12 month olds in group 1, but in groups 2 and 3 H. influenzae occurred more frequently than S. pneumoniae. Beta-lactamase-producing strains of pathogenic bacteria were formed in only 4% of all ears with effusion: H. influenzae in 1.2% and B. catarrhalis in 2.8%. Compared with figures from the United states, the frequency of beta-lactamase-producing strains is low in the present series. This is probably explained by differences in antimicrobial treatment practices; in Finland and the Scandinavian countries, penicillin V is the primary drug for acute otitis media. In light of present results, it seems well-suited for treatment of otitis media in young children.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (II). Distribution and  antibiotic sensitivity to 45 agents of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in Sendai city during the period from March in 1988 to February in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. Of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. Three hundred strains of potential (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. Many strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. On the other hand many strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. The sensitivity of 45 antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (EIKEN, Japan). No strain of the Haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. None of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. None of the Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. We conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.
TI  - Reappearance of group A streptococci in acute otitis media.
AB  - Specimens from acute otitis media (AOM) examined in the first quarter of the years 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989 were reviewed in order to point out any changes in the bacteriological etiology. A total of 1,722 specimens were taken in the community and in the hospitals of a county of 500,000 inhabitants in the 4-year-period: 447 (1986), 420 (1987), 388 (1988), 467 (1988). The majority of the specimens came from children less than 10 years of age. The specimen sampling technique differed between the various otologists, but their sampling techniques were constant through the years. Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent isolate and held a constant incidence of 29.9% with little variation. In 1986-88 Streptococcus pneumoniae was the second (19.8%) and group A streptococci (GAS) the third (9.8%) most common agent in frequency. In 1989 a change in the etiologic agents was seen as GAS increased in frequency to 18.8% (p less than 0.001), while no significant changes occurred in the frequency of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. 33% of the specimens were negative in the whole period. It is too early to decide whether a transient epidemic has occurred or whether the findings announce a more constant change in etiology.
TI  - Posttraumatic meningitis in adolescents and children.
AB  - To define the clinical features of posttraumatic meningitis in the pediatric age  group, we have reviewed 7 cases presenting to Children's Hospital-San Diego between 1981 and February 1988. Ages ranged from 3 to 16 years with 4 of the 7 patients being adolescents (greater than 13 years of age). These 4 adolescents accounted for 25% of the adolescent bacterial meningitis and all cases of nonmeningococcal meningitis in this age group. Six of 7 patients had positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures and positive blood cultures. Organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), group A streptococcus (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). Five of the 7 patients required intensive cardiovascular and respiratory support. Four patients had a good neurologic recovery, 2 patients had neurologic sequelae, and 1 suffered sensorineural hearing loss. These data suggest that direct invasion of the CSF by bacteria may cause sepsis and cardiovascular compromise. Further, in adolescents with nonmeningococcal bacterial meningitis, a history of previous head trauma and CSF leakage should be sought and radiographic evaluation for CSF fistula should be considered.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, Ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  - The dual-action antibacterial R 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. It was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. Ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (Staphylococcus aureus 753, Serratia marcescens SM and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and Streptococcus pyogenes. In prophylactic studies, Ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against Escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against S. pyogenes, but Ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against E. coli and more active than fleroxacin against S. pyogenes. In a murine pneumonia model, Ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Fleroxacin was inactive against S. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than Ro 23-9424 against K. pneumoniae. In a murine meningitis infection caused by S. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was 3 times as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. When meningitis was induced by K. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. In a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, Ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. In the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, Ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.
TI  - Bacterial agents associated with bronchopulmonary disorders in eastern Nigeria.
AB  - Altogether 16,539 sputum specimens were examined microbiologically from 1980 to 1984. Out of these 12,588 were screened by Ziehl-Neelsen's staining technique and 782 were (6.3%) found AFB-positive. Age and sex distributions of the AFB-positive individuals were statistically significant (at 0.05), incidence being most prevalent among those 20 years and above (90.2%) and among males (61.2%). From other specimens cultured, non-AFB organisms were isolated at the following frequencies: coliform-like organisms (15.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.3%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.0%). Proteus Spp. (0.7%) and Escherichia coli (0.5%). The antibiogram of these isolates revealed a high incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance, a situation that has most probably arisen from the high degree of antibiotic misuse in Nigeria.
TI  - Flow cytometric identification of microorganisms by dual staining with FITC and PI.
AB  - The identification of microorganisms by flow cytometry was evaluated by using a double staining technique with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate and a two dimensional analysis. A diverse group of 19 different species and strains of microorganisms was tested to determine if they could be differentiated by flow cytometry. The organisms tested displayed characteristic and distinct two dimensional fluorescent patterns which allowed ready grouping and differentiation into subsets of organisms. The slopes and correlation coefficients of the histograms and the ratio of red to green signals expressed these differences quantitatively and allowed organisms to be placed into one of three groups based on these values. In some instances, as with Streptococcus pneumoniae and pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, it was possible to distinguish between species of bacteria from the same genus. The use of dual dye labeling and flow cytometry provided a rapid method of identifying selected microorganisms and may be broadly applicable for the detection and identification of many bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Comparison of the nasal bacterial floras in two groups of healthy subjects and in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The nasal bacterial flora was studied in 183 healthy men entering military service (entry group), 103 healthy recruits in service (service group), and 185 recruits with acute maxillary sinusitis. The 267 nasal and ipsilateral sinus aspirate findings in the same patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were compared pairwise. In the entry group presumed sinus pathogens were only rarely isolated from the nasal cavities: Haemophilus influenzae in 4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1%, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3%, and Streptococcus pyogenes in 0%. The corresponding isolation frequencies in the service group were 19, 13, 3, and less than 1%, respectively, and those in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis were 61, 25, 7, and 6%, respectively. Suppression of the major components of the normal nasal flora, Corynebacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus, was seen in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis and also occasionally in the service group. When a sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen, the same pathogen was found in the nasal samples in 91% of the cases. The predictive value of a pathogen-positive nasal finding was highest (93.8%) for S. pyogenes, followed by 77.7% for H. influenzae and 68.7% for S. pneumoniae, and lowest (20%) for B. catarrhalis.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination. Treatment of bacterial infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Eighteen patients 2 months to 11 years of age with culture proven bacterial infections were treated with parenteral ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in a noncomparative study. Seven patients had pneumonia, two had tracheobronchitis, three had soft tissue abscess, two had periorbital cellulitis, three had urinary tract infection and one had purulent bursitis. Four of the 18 were bacteremic. Organisms treated included Staphylococcus aureus (6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Branhamella catarrhalis (2), Escherichia coli (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1) and Serratia marcescens (1). Thirteen of 15 (87%) organisms tested were beta-lactamase positive. Therapy was given intravenously in six doses per day at 310 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 28 (mean 11) days, with an average time of 4 days to clinical improvement. Seventeen patients (94%) were clinically cured. One patient with recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to mixed infection with multiple gram-negative enteric bacilli failed therapy. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Notably, mild to moderate thrombocytosis occurred in four (22%) patients that resolved uneventfully. We conclude that ticarcillin/clavulanic acid is safe and effective therapy for serious infections in hospitalized children.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a new tetracyclic quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a tetracyclic quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum. The in vitro activity of KB-5246 against gram-negative bacteria was higher than that of ofloxacin or norfloxacin and was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated the greatest activity against gram-positive bacteria of the four agents tested. Among Streptococcus pyogenes strains resistant to 1.56 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 26 strains susceptible to 0.2 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Similarly, among the Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains resistant to 3.13 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 23 S. aureus and 11 S. epidermidis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Among the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis strains resistant to 12.5 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 5 S. pneumoniae and 10 E. faecalis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. KB-5246 had bactericidal activity at the MIC. KB-5246 demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against various systemic infections in mice. After oral administration, KB-5246 was as active as ofloxacin and about two times more active than norfloxacin.
TI  - New receptor for human plasminogen on gram positive cocci.
AB  - 180 bacterial strains representing 17 different species of gram positive cocci were tested for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Receptors for plasminogen could be detected on 23/24 strains of S. pyogenes, 15/15 strains of S. equisimilis, 14/16 strains of human group G streptococci and 14/14 strains of S. pneumoniae. Eight of nineteen strains representing five species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were also positive. S. equisimilis demonstrated the highest uptake with a median value of 58 per cent (20%-67%). On the other hand, all strains of S. agalactiae, the majority of S. faecalis and all S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains tested were negative. The concentration of unlabelled plasminogen causing a 50 per cent reduction of bound tracer was between 50 and 150 mM. These estimates of the dissociation constant confirmed the specific nature of the interaction. Binding of plasminogen could be blocked by addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex, suggesting that plasminogen and plasmin bind to the same receptor. Binding was also blocked by the plasminogen fragment kringle 1-3, but not by miniplasminogen, a fragment containing kringle 5 and the B-chain region. As streptokinase interacts mainly with the B-chain of plasmin it is clear that the bacterial receptor for plasminogen is not identical to streptokinase.
TI  - Deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli; ingestion of S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis was moderate. Peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. To find out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized S. aureus. Upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (SAM), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with SAM. The results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by these macrophages. The release of hydrogen peroxide by SAM-pretreated peritoneal macrophages upon stimulation with PMA or opsonized S. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cefixime. A review of its antibacterial activity. Pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefixime, previously designated FK027, FR17027 and CL284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. It is particularly active against many Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. Cefixime has little activity against Staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. Comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Several comparative trials in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor 20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. The most frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. Thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. It is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - Prospective study of pharyngitis: clinical diagnosis and microbiological profile.
AB  - A prospective study of pharyngitis was carried out in the general population of twenty-two thousand in a small country town, over a period of ten weeks in the fall of 1984. It has been confirmed that, as in the past clinical diagnosis "streptococcal" and "nonstreptococcal" pharyngitis without microbiological examination is still highly inaccurate. From the clinical and microbiological parameters, the incidence in the period of follow-up was calculated as 7.2 and 12.0 cases per 100 population per year for streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis, respectively. These data document the health importance of this disease which is frequently underestimated. The M (by M or OF antigens) typability accounted for 62% of group A strains isolated, the prevailing types being M 1 and M 12. Comparison of M and OF typability of field strains immediately after isolation and three weeks later proved the superiority of an early typing. The accurate identification of prevailing types is essential for the prospect of streptococcal vaccine. In streptococcal pharyngitis cases treated with penicillin, the increase of antistreptolysin O and antideoxyribonuclease B titres was recorded in very few instances during a three week period after the onset of the disease. The examination of patients with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis aimed at detecting the role of some viruses or of M. pneumoniae proved that the etiology by these agents was practically nil in the cases concerned at this particular period of time. This finding suggests focusing interest on a possible role of other pathogens. The morbidity rates of pharyngitis, and the clinical as well as the microbiological data resulting from the study make it urgent to pay further attention to this infection and to attempt to elucidate the missing points in the etiology and diagnosis of this disease which belongs to the bacterial infections most frequently seen in man in economically developed countries.
TI  - [Cefotetan in the therapy of respiratory infections. Multicenter research].
AB  - In a controlled multicenter trial 291 patients have been treated with cefotetan.  They suffered from acute or chronic exacerbated bronchopulmonary disorders. In 110 patients it was possible to identify the etiological agent: enterobacteria (62), non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (10), Haemophilus influenzae (8), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (19), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (4). In the exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (203), cefotetan was generally administered at the dose of 1 g/12 h i.m., whereas it was administered at the dose of 2 g/12 h i.v. in acute infection. The mean duration of therapy was 8.8 days. Positive clinical results were obtained in 251 patients (86.2%) with eradication of the pathogen initially isolated in 90.5% of cases. Cefotetan showed good local and general tolerance. The results obtained confirm those of studies concerning limited numbers of patients and show the efficacy of cefotetan both in acute and chronic pathologies, also in patients with serious involvement of their general conditions (concomitant pathologies, high mean age).

TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil in pediatrics].
AB  - The clinical efficacy and the safety of cefteram pivoxil granule (CFTM-PI, T-2588), a newly prepared drug for pediatric use, were performed. A total of 60 patients with ages between 6 months and 14 years 3 months with pediatric infections were medicated with CFTM-PI at dose levels of 3.2-9.9 mg/kg 3 times daily for 3-11 days. Clinical responses to the drug were excellent in 3 of 3 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 14, good in 5 and poor in 2 of 21 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 1 and good in 2 of 3 patients with acute bronchitis, excellent in 16 and good in 8 of 24 patients with acute pneumonia, excellent in 3 and good in 1 of 4 patients with acute urinary tract infection and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with acute purulent lymphadenitis, hence the overall clinical efficacy rate was 96.5% in a total of 57 patients. Bacteriological responses to the drug were as follows: Eradicated, 8 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 19 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive; 7, beta-lactamase negative; 12), 1 strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase positive) and 4 strains of Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase positive; 1, beta-lactamase negative; 3), decreased, 1 strain of S. pyogenes, hence the eradication rate was 97.2%. No side effects were encountered in any of the patients but for 3 who had diarrhoea and 1 who had loose stool, though these changes were slight. As abnormal laboratory test data, elevation of GOT was noted in 1 case, thrombocytosis and elevation of GPT in another. Also, none of the patients refused or complained of difficulty in intaking of the drug via oral route. In conclusion, CFTM-PI appeared to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic against pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil granules in pediatrics].
AB  - A newly developed cephalosporin, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), was evaluated clinically in 40 patients. A pharmacokinetic study was also performed with 8 patients. CFTM-PI was administered as granules. One patient was given CFTM-PI at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, each of 3 patients was given the drug at a dose of 3 mg/kg and each of 4 patients at a dose of 6 mg/kg. In most cases, serum concentrations of CFTM were determined at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Urinary concentrations of CFTM were measured for urinary samples collected during periods of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 and 6-8 hours after dosing. CFTM was assayed using the disk or the cup method using Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031 as the test organism. The clinical evaluation was conducted in 40 children including 13 patients of acute tonsillitis, 10 of acute lacunar tonsillitis, 10 of scarlet fever, 2 of acute bronchitis, 2 of pneumonia, and 1 each of pneumonia with enteritis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The patients were from 4 months to 13 years old. Daily doses were from 8.7 to 12 mg/kg. After CFTM-PI administration in doses 1.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak serum concentrations of CFTM were 0.38 microgram/ml, 0.73-2.25 micrograms/ml and 1.2-2.9 micrograms/ml, respectively, and half-lives were 1.55, 0.95-2.30 and 0.80-2.72 hours, respectively. Urinary excretion rates up to 6 or 8 hours after dosing were 10.8-24.7%. Clinical efficacies of CFTM-PI in 40 patients were "excellent" in 27 children, "good" in 12 children and "fair" in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.5%. Twenty seven strains of causative organisms, including 15 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Salmonella 04, 6 of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Branhamella catarrhalis, were isolated. After treatment all strains except 1 strain of B. catarrhalis (unchanged), Salmonella 04 (unknown) and 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae (unknown) were eradicated. Side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea. Eosinophilia was observed in 1 case.
TI  - [A clinical study on cefteram pivoxil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), a new oral cephem antibiotic of ester type, was evaluated for its safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics. 1. One child, 4 years of age (18 kg body weight), was administered orally 3 mg/kg after meal. The peak serum level of CFTM was 0.78 microgram/ml after 2 hours, and cumulative urinary excretion rate during the first 6 hours was 15.0%. 2. Clinical studies on CFTM-PI were carried out in 17 pediatric patients; 1 with acute pharyngitis, 2 with acute tonsillitis, 1 each with pertussis, acute bronchitis, 2 with broncho-pneumonia, 4 with scarlatina, 3 with acute otitis media, and 1 each with lymphadenitis, acrobystitis and urinary tract infection. Clinical responses were excellent in 9, good in 6, fair in 1, poor in 1, and the overall clinical efficacy rate was 88.2%. 3. Bacteriological efficacy was investigated with 10 strains of 5 species (Streptococcus pyogenes 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae 2, Haemophilus influenzae 2, Enterococcus and Bacteroides 1) isolated from 9 patients. All strains were eradicated. 4. As to adverse reactions, mild diarrhea was observed in 1 patient. But therapy had to be continued without procedure and the diarrhea disappeared after 6 days. No adverse hematological, renal or hepatic effects were noted.
TI  - Randomized comparative study of ampicillin/sulbactam vs. ceftriaxone for treatment of soft tissue and skeletal infections in children.
AB  - In a prospective study 105 children hospitalized with soft tissue infection, 11 children with suppurative arthritis and 9 children with osteomyelitis were treated with either parenterally administered ampicillin/sulbactam or ceftriaxone. Treatment was randomized using a computer-generated table in a 2:1 fashion: 84 patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 41 patients received ceftriaxone. Organisms isolated from wound site or blood cultures included Staphylococcus aureus (33), Streptococcus pyogenes (19), Haemophilus influenzae (9) including 4 beta-lactamase-positive organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (3) and 9 other organisms. Clinical and bacteriologic response was satisfactory in 100% of the ampicillin/sulbactam-treated patients and in 93% of the ceftriaxone-treated patients. Two patients with S. aureus infections treated with ceftriaxone had a delayed response and required change in therapy to parenterally administered oxacillin. Ampicillin/sulbactam represents a potentially useful single agent for the treatment of cellulitis and bone or joint infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an  orally absorbed cephalosporin, with that of cephalexin and cefaclor. It inhabited Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.25 microgram/ml, sero groups B, C and G streptococci at 1 microgram/ml, and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 2 micrograms/ml. It was slightly more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. MDL 19,592 did not significantly inhibit Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. strains (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). MDL 19,592 was not hydrolyzed by the plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1 of Klebsiella but was hydrolyzed by the TEM-3, Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase, and the chromosomal-mediated Enterobacter cloacae P99 enzymes.
TI  - Cloning of a gene encoding a major secreted polypeptide of Listeria monocytogenes and its potential use as a species-specific probe.
AB  - A gene, designated msp, that encodes a major secreted polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 60 kilodaltons (kDa) was cloned from Listeria monocytogenes 10403. DNA hybridization analysis indicated that the msp gene was highly conserved among 15 independent L. monocytogenes isolates and that each of 5 isolates tested secreted a 60-kDa polypeptide that was immunologically related to the msp gene product. DNA sequences related to msp were not detected in any other Listeria species or in strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae when standard stringent DNA hybridization conditions were used. Under nonstringent conditions, related sequences were detected in Listeria ivanovii, Listeria seeligeri, and Listeria innocua, and immunoblot analysis indicated that these strains secreted polypeptides of about 60 kDa that were immunologically related to the msp gene product. The possibility of using the msp gene as a probe for the detection of L. monocytogenes and the potential functions of the msp gene product are discussed.

AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil(cefteram) a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of cefteram (CFTM) were determined upon oral administration after meal of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI) at doses of 3 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 6 mg/kg granules in 2. Peak serum levels of CFTM were obtained at 3 hours in 2 cases and 4 hours in 2 cases after administration of the drug with a range of 0.74-2.2 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.77-3.62 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration ranged from 9.6-23.0%. 2. MICs of CFTM against 22 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 4, Staphylococcus aureus 2, Branhamella catarrhalis 1, Haemophilus influenzae 8, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1, and Escherichia coli 2) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFTM was superior to those of CCL and CEX, and was superior against Gram-negative rods and equal against Gram-positive cocci to those of ABPC. 3. Twenty-six pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, tonsillitis 7, epiglottitis 1, bronchitis 5, pneumonia 5, urinary tract infection 3, cervical lymphadenitis 2) were treated with CFTM-PI at daily doses of 9.3-15.3 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 70% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefteram pivoxil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Fifty-three patients with bacterial infections were treated with 8.3 to 21.8 mg/kg/day of CFTM-PI. The drug was very effective (efficacy rate 98.1%) in pharyngitis, otitis media, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia and skin infections. The antibacterial potency was very good against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and was comparable with cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with the CFTM-PI therapy. The data suggest that CFTM-PI is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588) fine granules in children were performed and the following results were obtained. 1. Peak serum concentrations in 4 children given orally a dose of 3 mg/kg and 2 children given orally a dose of 6 mg/kg after meal were reached in 3 to 4 hours and the concentration curves were dependent on dosage levels. The urinary recovery rates up to 8 hours were 29.7% in children given a dose of 3 mg/kg and 29.7% in children given a dose of 6 mg/kg. 2. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 38 patients with bacterial infections. Twenty seven patients were given each doses of 3 mg/kg in 3 times a day and other 11 patients each doses of 6 mg/kg in 3 times. Clinical effects of CFTM-PI were excellent in 18, good in 19, fair in 1 case, hence the overall clinical efficacy rate was 97.4%. 3. Bacteriologically, 24 strains of causative organisms were isolated. The overall bacteriological eradication rate was 81.8%. Antimicrobial activities were excellent especially against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. 4. As for the side effects, slight loose stools were observed in 2 cases, and in laboratory tests, elevations of GOT and GPT were observed in 1 case and an elevation of eosinophil was observed in 1 case. But no one needed any treatment. 5. CFTM-PI is a useful and safe oral antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - Cooperative binding of two antibodies to independent antigens by an Fc-dependent  mechanism.
AB  - Binding of a murine N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-specific IgG3 monoclonal antibody to a solid phase expressing GlcNAc determinants and phosphocholine (PC) determinants is enhanced by IgG3, but not IgG2b, PC-specific monoclonal antibody. The cooperative binding requires an intact Fc region on the GlcNAc-specific monoclonal antibody and is hypothesized to result from Fc-Fc association. Although the in vivo relevance of this phenomenon requires further study, intermolecular cooperativity in binding of antibody to multivalent antigens, such as bacterial cell wall antigens, could represent an adaptive mechanism for antibodies expressing low intrinsic affinities for highly repeated epitopes. Furthermore, the ability of antibodies of distinct specificity to participate in cooperative binding offers, at least in principle, new approaches to optimizing antibody targeting.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.

These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefodizime on pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was injected intravenously to 13 cases of pediatric infections. Patients received the drug at a dose level of approximately 20 mg/kg x 3 times daily. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 4 patients, good in 6 and poor in 0 for 10 cases (2 phlegmon, 1 periproctal abscess, 5 pneumonia and 2 bronchitis) except 3 Mycoplasma pneumonia. 2. Three strains of pathogens were followed for their changes (Streptococcus pyogenes in 1 phlegmon, Klebsiella pneumoniae in periproctal abscess and Haemophilus influenzae in 1 bronchitis) and they were found to have been eliminated. 3. No adverse reactions occurred. Abnormal changes in laboratory test data found were 2 cases of eosinophilia, 1 cash each of increased GOT and GPT, and thrombocytosis, but none of them was severe.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine isolated from Prosopis juliflora.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from Prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two Candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. Significant inhibitory effect was noted against Gram positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. citreus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against S. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. lactis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, C. hofmannii and Bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. Its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. The inhibitory effect of julifloricine on Gram negative bacteria such as the species of Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Aeromonas and Vibrio was almost insignificant. Julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against C. tropicalis and responded equally to C. albicans. As compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which included Herpes simplex 1 and Newcastle disease virus. Julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. In the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. The more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml) of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). Cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. Due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). As a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative chemotherapeutic activity of new fluorinated 4-quinolones and standard agents against a variety of bacteria in a mouse infection model.
AB  - The new fluorinated 4-quinolones appear to represent orally effective alternatives to parenteral and oral agents currently in use. A number of new fluorinated 4-quinolones were compared in acute systemic mouse-infection models with various Gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci), Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also included were standard oral and parenteral antimicrobial agents. CI-934 was the most potent quinolone in infections induced by Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae. CI-934, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were as effective as or superior to standard oral agents currently utilized in infections induced by the Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. They were active against antibiotic-susceptible strains and strains resistant to beta-lactams and gentamicin. Most were also quite potent against systemic P. aeruginosa mouse infections. These studies indicate good chemotherapeutic potential for the new generation fluorinated 4-quinolones in infections induced by the staphylococci, streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, including strains resistant to standard antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (CFTM) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (CCL). 2. Activities of cefixime (CFIX) were superior to those of CFTM against B. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to CFTM against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of CCL against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and S. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to CFTM and CFIX against most of Gram-negative rods. 4. Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its MICs did not exceed the MICs of ampicillin by itself. SBTPC showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Rapid detection of Bordetella pertussis by a monoclonal antibody-based colony blot assay.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies to Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used in a colony blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed for rapid detection of B. pertussis. Bacterial colonies from Bordet-Gengou agar plates were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter disks, lysed by immersion in chloroform, and reacted with monoclonal antibodies. Following reaction with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antisera and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, blue dots representing single colonies appeared on the filters. Blotting of single B. pertussis colonies could be performed after incubation for 40 h, i.e., before the colonies were visible by eye on the agar surface. Ten of ten B. pertussis strains showed positive blotting reactions with antibodies specific for B. pertussis FHA and LPS. Fourteen of fourteen B. parapertussis strains reacted with two of the FHA-specific antibodies but not with two of the LPS-specific antibodies. Strains of B. bronchiseptica showed a variable reaction pattern. No cross-reactions were observed with strains of Streptococcus mitis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. This assay may be useful for identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in suspected cases of whooping cough.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  - To study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membrane receptor (FcRlo, CR1, and CR3)-mediated phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups A and B streptococci were examined. IGIV alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. When these bacteria were preopsonized in IGIV, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. The in vitro opsonic activity of IGIV for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by the IGIV-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, P less than .05). The in vivo protective efficacy of IGIV also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, P less than .001). Antibodies to FcRlo (Leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in IGIV but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific IgM. Both CR1 and CR3 receptors on PMNLs were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic activity of FCE 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. In experimental pneumonia FCE 22891 was the most active antibiotic. In aerobic abscesses FCE 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against Str. pyogenes. In abscesses caused by Gram-negative bacteria, FCE 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. Cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant Esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of Ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. Cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against Gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of Ent. cloacae. FCE 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by Bacteroides fragilis 101. We conclude that FCE 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on clarithromycin in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Clarithromycin].
AB  - Clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic agent, was evaluated bacteriologically and clinically for its efficacy and safety in pediatrics by a study group organized with pediatricians from all over the country. A summary of the results of the evaluation is as follows. 1. Absorption and excretion Pharmacokinetics of TE-031 was examined by single oral administration of 10% granules and 50 mg tablets at doses of 1, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. There were no significant differences between 10% granules and 50 mg tablets, and between administrations before and after meal. Peaks and half-life periods of blood level of TE-031 given once at doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg (10% granules) before meal were 1.58, 4.37 and 3.79 micrograms/ml, and 2.53, 3.17 and 2.20 hours, respectively, and the urinary excretion in 6 hours after the administration were about 20-30%. 2. Antibacterial effects TE-031 was proved to have excellent antibacterial effect, i.e., inhibiting growth over 80% of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.10 micrograms/ml, Branhamella catarrhalis at 0.39 micrograms/ml, and Campylobacter jejuni at 0.78 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococcus aureus, TE-031 showed very similar activity spectrum to EM, and EM resistant strains were also resistant to TE-031. 3. Clinical results A total of 764 cases was studied. Clinical effects of TE-031 were evaluated in 717 cases out of the 764, excluding drop-outs and cases which did not meet specified protocols. Clinically, efficacies of TE-031 were "excellent" in 265 cases and "good" in 161 cases out of 453 cases of Group A in which causal agents were identified, with an efficacy rate of 94.0%, and out of 264 cases of Group B in which pathogens were not detected, clinical effects of TE-031 were "excellent" in 115 cases and "good" in 124 cases, with an efficacy rate of 90.5%. In terms of clinical effects of TE-031 classified by diseases when Group A and B were combined, efficacy rates were 91.6% for upper respiratory tract infection (217/237), 90.0% for bacterial pneumonia (108/120), 97.4% for Mycoplasma pneumonia (111/114), 100% for Chlamydia pneumonia (4/4), 85.0% for pertussis (34/40), 100% for scarlet fever (16/16), 83.9% for skin and soft tissue infection (26/31), and 98.9% for Campylobacter enteritis (87/88).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on use of clarithromycin granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Studies were conducted on in vivo pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268) in children and also on the efficacy and the safety of this macrolide antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. TE-031 granules were orally administered to 5 children in a dosage of 5 mg/kg before meal. Maximum drug concentrations (range: 0.29-2.0 micrograms/ml) in the serum occurred during a period from 30 minutes to 1 hour after administration, but there were clear differences in blood concentrations among the individuals. 2. TE-031 granules were orally administered in a average dosage of 20 mg/kg/day to a total of 17 patients, consisting of 14 children with respiratory tract infections and 3 children with intestinal infections. The clinical efficacy evaluation resulted in 10 excellent cases, 6 good cases and 1 fair case, for an efficacy rate of 94.1%. 3. Studies on the bacterial efficacy were carried out for 10 cases. The TE-031 bacteriological efficacy evaluation showed elimination in 7 cases, a decreased bacterial count in 2 cases, and no change in 1 case. The elimination rate was, thus, 70.0%. Elimination rates according to different species of bacteria were 66.7% (2 of 3 strains) for Staphylococcus aureus, 100% for both Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 of 3) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1 of 1), and 42.9% (3 of 7) for Haemophilus influenzae. 4. There were no symptoms which were attributable to side effects of the TE-031 therapy. The only laboratory test abnormality detected was eosinophilia in 1 patient.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were determined upon oral administration on fasting of TE-031 at doses of 5 mg/kg granules in 1 case and tablets in 2 cases, and 10 mg/kg granules in 1 and 15 mg/kg granules in 1. Peak serum levels were obtained at 30 minutes in 2 cases, at 1 hour in 2 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.29-7.10 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 2.2-7.5 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours after administration ranged from 7.1-34.5%. 2. MICs of TE-031 against 49 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 5 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9, Staphylococcus aureus 3, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 14, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 7, and Campylobacter jejuni 7) were compared with those of josamycin (JM), erythromycin (EM), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of TE-031 was superior to those of JM and equal to those of EM. 3. Fifty-five pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, pharyngitis and tonsillitis 15, pertussis 2, pneumonia 10, bronchitis 14, Campylobacter enteritis 11) were treated with TE-031 at daily doses of 10-35 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 96% clinically and 72% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 5. None of children refused TE-031.
TI  - Allergy in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The occurrence of allergy was studied in 224 patients with verified acute maxillary sinusitis by means of an allergy questionnaire, skin testing, and nasal smears. Allergy was found in 56 patients (25%). In addition, allergy was considered probable in 14 patients (6.5%). The corresponding percentages in the control group were 16.5 and 3, respectively. The difference is statistically significant P less than 0.05). However, the frequency of allergy is lower in the present series than in those previously reported on chronic sinusitis. There were no differences between allergic and non-allergic patients in the number of prior acute sinusitis episodes or of previously performed sinus irrigations. Bacteriological and radiological findings did not differ significantly between the groups.
TI  - Rapid streptococcal antigen detection in experimental keratitis.
AB  - We assessed the role of commercially available immunodiagnostic procedures in comparison to Gram stain and culture in experimental bacterial keratitis. Rabbit corneas were inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. faecalis, or Haemophilus influenzae. Corneal scrapings were processed before and during antibacterial therapy using a coagglutination assay to detect pneumococcal capsular antigen (Phadebact Pneumococcus test) and an enzyme immunoassay to detect group A streptococcal cell-wall antigen (TestPack Strep A test). In untreated infected eyes, both immunoassays were highly specific and as sensitive as Gram stain for detection of the respective microorganisms. For S. pneumoniae keratitis, the sensitivity of coagglutination was 82% and Gram stain, 73%. For S. pyogenes keratitis, the sensitivity of enzyme immunoassay was 100% and Gram stain, 62%. Immunoassays and Gram stain were less sensitive than culture during antibacterial therapy. Successful clinical application of the coagglutination assay in a patient with pneumococcal keratitis permitted early use of specific cephalosporin treatment.
TI  - The bacteriology of acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Sinus secretions obtained by antral aspiration from 347 patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were examined bacteriologically. Special attention was paid to the method by which anaerobic bacteria could be recovered. On the total, 485 sinus secretion samples were examined, of these 336 were aspirates, 149 yields of injection-aspirations. Aerobic bacteria were cultured from 263 aspirates and from 100 injection-aspiration samples. Only anaerobes were recovered from 6 sinuses. Bacterial culture was negative in 115 sinuses (24%). The most common pathogens isolated were Haemophilus influenzae (50.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.5%), Streptococcus pyogenes (5%) and Branhamella catarrhalis (1.5%). A true anaerobic infection was considered to be present in only 7 sinuses (1.5%) indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis. According to this study the most common pathogen in acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults is H. influenzae. From this follows that in such patients aminopenicillins may be a more appropriate choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis.
TI  - Stimulation of cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic functions of natural killer cells by bacterial membrane proteoglycans and ribosomes.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the effect of membrane proteoglycans (MPG) from Klebsiella pneumoniae on the function of human natural killer (NK) cells. MPG combined with bacterial ribosomes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, constitute a bacterial immunomodulator (MS D 53), currently in clinical use. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) exposed in vitro to MPG or MS D 53 for 20 h showed enhanced NK cytotoxicity. Augmentation of NK cytotoxicity depended upon a direct effect on NK cells, inasmuch as these compounds were also effective on highly purified large granular lymphocytes (LGL). We also studied the effects of MPG on non-cytotoxic functions of NK cells, namely in vitro locomotion and production of IL-1. MPG (and MS D 53) induced IL-1 release in LGL. Moreover, MPG-treated LGL showed enhanced locomotory activity, as assessed by measuring the penetration into nitrocellulose filters. The capacity of MPG (and MS D 53) to activate cytotoxic and noncytotoxic functions of NK cells may contribute to enhancement of nonspecific resistance in vivo after treatment with this agent.
TI  - Bacterial flora in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity of healthy young men.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and nasopharynx was studied in 86 healthy young men. Common pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were isolated from only 6% of all 172 nasal cavities. The same pathogens were isolated from 27% of 86 nasopharyngeal samples. H. influenzae dominated over S. pneumoniae both in the nose and the nasopharynx. No culture either from the nose or nasopharynx grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Potentially pathogenic bacteria, non-group-A hemolytic streptococci and various groups of Neisseria meningitidis were isolated from the nasopharynx in 20% of the subjects. According to the present study healthy adults do not carry group-A hemolytic streptococci in the nose and seldom if ever in the pharynx. Thus, isolation of S. pyogenes by bacterial culture is suggestive of a bacterial infection by this agent at these sites. Isolation of hemolytic streptococci other than group A from the pharynx does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection, and the same holds true for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Roxithromycin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. It has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. Roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. Roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.
TI  - [Current bacteriologic status and therapeutic results in acute otitis media in children aged over 3 months].
AB  - 355 children, 3 months to 15 years old, presenting with acute otitis media, underwent a bacteriological study of otitis exsudate. From November 1985 to September 1987, 162 myringotomy and 149 acute otitis media spontaneously discharging were studied in Paris. From October 1981 to September 1987, 62 myringotomy and 46 spontaneously discharging acute otitis were studied in Valognes. There was none pathogenic bacterium in respectively 20 and 14% of the samples. Two or more pathogenic bacterium were isolated in 24 and 7% of the samples. In Paris as in Valognes, 3 pathogens were predominants: Haemophilus (17% were beta-lactamase producers), S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus. There was only 5 and 3% Streptococcus pyogenes, 2% Branhamella catarrhalis in Paris, none in Valognes. Pseudomonas was present only in case of spontaneous otorrhea, even if recent. For the moment, the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is not our first treatment in case of acute otitis media in children. Actually we prescribe amoxicillin alone, 50 to 100 mg/kg/day. If the child is allergic to beta lactamin, we give him the combination of trimethoprime and sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Immunomodulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes by D53 Immucytal and its constitutive fractions.
AB  - D53 (Immucytal) is a compositive vaccine made of immunogenic ribosomes extracted  from 4 bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae) associated with a membrane proteoglycan from a non-encapsulated strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (MPG-Kp). In this work we have studied the effect of the compound on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) function "in vitro". We have demonstrated that D53 was able to significantly increase Fc- receptor dependent phagocytosis without modify the C3-receptor dependent activity. Furthermore D53 enhanced the oxidative metabolism (evaluated by chemiluminescence) both using cells in resting conditions or after stimulation with phagocytable or soluble stimuli. On the contrary D53 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PMN migration toward different chemoattractants. Using the two constitutive fractions of the compound (ribosomes and proteoglycans) we have observed that the MPG-Kp component was mainly responsible for the modulating activity of the drug on human PMNs.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - The role of Haemophilus influenzae in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children.
AB  - The role of specific bacteria in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children in unknown. To determine the effect of specific bacteria on the presence and nature of tonsillar hypertrophy (measured both clinically and by tonsil weight), quantitative aerobic bacteriology was performed on 54 tonsil-core specimens from 54 children undergoing tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy. Twelve tonsil-core biopsies from 12 children with no history of tonsil disease served as controls. Haemophilus influenzae (HI), Streptococcus pyogenes (SP), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPn), and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) were the most common microorganisms cultured from diseased tonsils. Few bacteria were cultured from the cores of controls. HI was cultured as the dominant aerobic bacteria in 15 of 54 tonsils (27%). For HI alone, the number of bacteria/gram tonsil showed a significant positive correlation to tonsil weight (p less than 0.05). Fourteen of 15 (94%) tonsils with HI were found in patients with clinical tonsillar hypertrophy, while only 6 of 10 patients (60%) with SP and SPn had tonsillar hypertrophy. Of the 38 tonsils removed for obstructive symptoms (clinical hypertrophy), 14 of 38 (37%) cultured HI as the dominant microorganisms, whereas only 6 of 38 (16%) cultured SP. Neither the type of HI (b vs. non-b) nor the presence of beta-lactamase production had a significant correlation to tonsil weight, bacterial load or the number of B- or T-cell subsets. The number of T-helper (Th), T-suppressor (Ts) and B-cells (per gram/tonsil) was markedly greater in all diseased tonsils than in controls. For both HI and SP the total number of bacteria/gram tonsil correlated positively to the number of Ts cells (p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.007, respectively). In patients with HI type b (HI-b), the tonsil weight correlated to an increase in Ts and B-cells (p less than 0.004 and p less than 0.007, respectively). An increased presence of the Ts and B-cells in the HI-b tonsils (and not in tonsils with HI non-b) suggests a differential response by the tonsil to these distinct but related bacteria. The above data strongly support an etiological role for HI in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children. Alterations in the relationship between Th and Ts cells may affect normal B-cell function and be implicated in this phenomenon. Clinical implications for pathogenesis, antimicrobial therapy, and future directions for research are discussed.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Macroscopic purulence, leukocyte counts, and bacterial morphotypes in relation to culture findings for sinus secretions in acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Macroscopic purulence, leukocyte counts, and bacterial morphotypes in Gram-stained smears were investigated in 335 sinus secretions (240 aspirates and 95 injection aspirates) obtained by puncture in 234 young patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. Over 90% of the 147 aspirates macroscopically classified as purulent also contained high numbers of leukocytes (greater than 20 per oil immersion field). A total of 82% of the 147 macroscopically purulent aspirates and 79% of the 156 aspirates containing high numbers of leukocytes yielded presumed sinus pathogens by culture in quantities of greater than 10(3) CFU/ml. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes was associated relatively more often (92 or 87%, respectively) with high numbers of leukocytes than Haemophilus influenzae, which was not infrequently (29%) recovered from the less purulent aspirates. When a bacterial morphotype was seen in the Gram-stained smear, a corresponding sinus pathogen was isolated in quantities of greater than 10(3) CFU/ml in 92% of aspirates. Other bacterial species (most often staphylococci) were usually isolated in low numbers and were almost never seen in the smear, suggesting nasal contamination. The 95 injection aspirates behaved, to a large extent, like diluted aspirates, with the exception that there was a higher frequency of probable nasal contamination. Macroscopic purulence, high leukocyte counts, and bacterial morphotypes seen in Gram-stained smears each predicted well the isolation of a presumed sinus pathogen and in some cases supported the significance of an otherwise doubtful culture finding. However, the macroscopic appearance of the secretion should not be used to screen samples for culture, because in several cases H. influenzae grew from nonpurulent samples as well.
TI  - Bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  - Bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. A total of 76% of the secretions were positive. The most common pathogens isolated were Haemophilus influenzae (50%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), Streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. The staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. Other aerobic species were found only occasionally. Anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. In one-half of these, a low concentration of Propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). Only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. The high recovery of H. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 H. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of ceftibuten (7432-S, SCH 39720), a novel orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  - 7432-S (SCH 39720) was the most active beta-lactam tested against the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 92% of strains at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml compared to 82%, 65% and 39% of strains inhibited by cefixime, cefuroxime and cefaclor, respectively. 7432-S was also very effective against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria meningitidis (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml). Serogroup B streptococci and the penicillin-resistant pneumococci were generally less susceptible to 7432-S and comparison cephems than Streptococcus pyogenes or penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates. Pseudomonas spp., enterococci, Acinetobacter spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were routinely resistant to 7432-S (MIC50s, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Oral absorption of cephalosporin antibiotics. 3. Synthesis and biological properties of 7 alpha-methoxy-7 beta-(arylacetamido)-3-chloro-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of 7 alpha-methoxy-7 beta-amido-3-chloro-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acids was prepared and evaluated for biological activity. When compared with the parent 7-non-methoxy analogues, these new 7 alpha-methoxy-3-chloro cephalosporins displayed diminished antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Once-daily administration of ceftriaxone for the treatment of selected serious bacterial infections in children.
AB  - Ceftriaxone treatment (50 to 80 mg/kg once daily) was given to 201 children between 1 month and 18 years of age. There were 201 serious bacterial infections, including epiglottitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, and meningitis. The common pathogens responsible for pediatric infections isolated from these patients included Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The overall clinic cure rate was 94%. Ten patients were clinically improved but not cured. There were two clinical failures. Bacteriologic failure occurred in six patients. The overall bacteriologic cure rate was 97%. Twenty patients (10%) experienced adverse effects; none required discontinuation of therapy. The efficacy, safety, spectrum, and convenience of ceftriaxone monotherapy make this antimicrobial agent a candidate for the treatment of choice of selected serious pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (ABPC) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (SBT) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. SBTPC is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide ABPC and SBT for systemic circulation. In the present study, the antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against 50 isolates each of 6 species (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-Lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (PCG) of cefazolin (CEZ) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: S. aureus 86%; K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; B. catarrhalis 68%; H. influenzae 24%. Fourteen per cent of S. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both PCG and CEZ acidometry discs. SBTPC, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. Good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (PCase). Average MIC80 values of SBTPC were 3.13 micrograms/ml for S. aureus and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for B. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for S. pyogenes. As SBTPC was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against PCase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of SBTPC compared to ABPC alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by SBT which, as noted above, is a component of SBTPC in an equimolar ratio to ABPC.
TI  - [Clinical examination of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor on chronic respiratory tract infection].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor), a granule form of cefaclor, was performed in 20 patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The patients subjected to the study consisted of 11 males and 9 females with ages between 44 and 76 years. S 6472 was given orally to each patient in a daily dose of 750 mg in 2 divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 days in 1 case, 7 days in 11 cases, 11 days in 3 cases and 14 days in 5 cases. A total of 5 strains including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified from sputum samples before the administration of the drug. All strains were eradicated but, instead 2 strains, 1 strain each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared after the therapy. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.0% (19/20): Excellent in 5 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case. No side effects were observed, but eosinophilia was observed in 1 case. From the above results, it appeared that S 6472 was effective, safe and useful agent for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of 7432-S (SCH39720) against commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Penicillin tolerance among oral streptococci.
AB  - Penicillin tolerance was elicited in 18 of 46 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from the mouths of 19 of 20 healthy subjects and in 31 of 54 consecutive blood-culture isolates of streptococci. Enterococci and Streptococcus sanguis were the organisms most frequently tolerant but the property was also common among isolates of S. mutans, S. mitior and Lancefield Group G streptococci. Pneumococci and S. salivarius were rarely tolerant. When incubated with penicillin at 5 x MIC in batch or continuous cultures, both tolerant and sensitive strains of oral streptococci declined in number less rapidly than S. pyogenes. However, combinations of penicillin and gentamicin killed tolerant and sensitive oral streptococci.
TI  - Many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence GalNAc beta 1-4Gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  - Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States. To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). Bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. They do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, Forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and Cad. The finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked GalNAc, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-GM1 and asialo-GM1 and terminally in asialo-GM2, is required for binding. beta-N-Acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence GalNAc beta 1-3Gal. These data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. Other bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella species, and some E. coli, do not bind to the GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequence. The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-GM1 occur in human lung tissue.
TI  - Periorbital cellulitis. Clinical and laboratory findings in 146 episodes, including tear countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in 89 episodes.
AB  - Medical records of 144 children hospitalized for 146 episodes of periorbital cellulitis were reviewed. During 44 episodes, systemically administered antibiotics were given before hospitalization. Bacterial pathogens were isolated in only two (5%) of 44 episodes in pretreated patients compared with 33 (32%) of 102 episodes in patients who were not pretreated. Thirty-one children who were not pretreated were bacteremic. Compared with nonbacteremic children who were not pretreated, bacteremic children were younger, more often had a history of upper respiratory tract infection and fever, had a higher white blood cell count and temperature at admission, and more often had a violaceous cellulitis. No difference between groups existed in the frequency of a history of trauma or a local lesion near the affected eye. Tear specimens from 13 of 89 children tested by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) to detect Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide were positive. Compared with positive blood culture results, tear CIE has a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 93%. Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were not detected by CIE.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity after administration of erythromycin estolate and erythromycin ethylsuccinate to healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a crossover design study, we compared the plasma bactericidal activities of erythromycin estolate (500 mg) and erythromycin ethylsuccinate (600 mg) after administration of a single oral dose to 12 healthy volunteers. Both erythromycin esters displayed very good plasma bactericidal activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The median bactericidal titers produced in plasma against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly higher with erythromycin estolate than with the ethylsuccinate ester at both 2 and 8 h after dosing (P less than 0.05 by Student's t test). Both erythromycin esters showed rather weak bactericidal activity against Branhamella catarrhalis; a further look at these results indicated that erythromycin estolate presented 50% of the plasma samples at 2 h with bactericidal titers superior or equal to 1:8, versus 11% for the ethylsuccinate ester. Of the 60 plasma bactericidal activity tests performed against Staphylococcus aureus, only 6 (10%) and 3 (5%) exhibited titers of 1:8 or greater for erythromycin estolate and erythromycin ethylsuccinate, respectively. Clinical trials are warranted in which these products are compared in infections other than Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis, for which the clinical superiority of erythromycin estolate has been demonstrated.
TI  - A comparison of the identification of group A streptococci and enterococci by two rapid pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase methods.
AB  - Group A streptococci and enterococci can be differentiated from other streptococci by their ability to cleave L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-napthylamide (PYR). The authors evaluated two pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase (PYRase) systems--Minitek (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) and Identicult-AE (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskeville, RI)--for the presumptive identification of Group A streptococci and enterococci. Eighty-three Group A streptococci, 77 beta-hemolytic non-Group A streptococci, 74 enterococci, 56 nonenterococcal non-beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 1 Aerococcus were tested. Compared with results obtained with reference methods (bile esculin agar and 6.5% [w/v] sodium chloride for identification of enterococci, and latex agglutination tests by Streptex [Burroughs Wellcome, NC] for grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci) both the Identicult-AE and MInitek systems were 100% sensitive and specific for identification of both enterococci and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Advantages of the Identicult-AE system compared with Minitek were the use of a smaller inoculum for which subculture was not necessary, incubation at room temperature rather than at 37 degrees C, and lower cost. Both PYRase kits tested, and in particular the Identicult-AE system, were very easy to use and should be considered as rapid, reliable, and cost-effective alternative methods for the presumptive identification of Group A streptococci and enterococci in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup, a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates after oral administration on fasting of RKM dry syrup at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg to 2 and 1 cases, respectively, were determined. Peak plasma levels were obtained in 30 minutes after administration of both dosages with half-lives of 1.5 to 2.2 hours. A clear-cut dose response was observed. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 1.75 to 2.26%. 2. The MICs of RKM against 80 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 9, Streptococcus pneumoniae 14, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 27, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 9, Haemophilus haemolyticus 2, Haemophilus parahaemolyticus 14 and Campylobacter jejuni 1) were compared with MICs of midecamycin acetate (MOM), josamycin (JM) and erythromycin (EM). The antibacterial activity of RKM was superior to those of MOM and JM and slightly inferior to that of EM. 3. Twenty-eight pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (acute tonsillitis 4, streptococcal infection 4, acute bronchitis 9, pneumonia 4, mycoplasmal pneumonia 2 and Campylobacter enteritis 5) were treated with RKM dry syrup at a daily dose of 12-42.9 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. Efficacy rates were 92.9% clinically and 58.6% bacteriologically. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were mild; thrombocytosis in 2 and eosinophilia in 1. 5. The taste and the odor of RKM dry syrup preparation were sufficiently tolerable for the pediatric patients to accept it.
TI  - The clinical use of macrolides.
AB  - Macrolides are active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the main causes of community-acquired pneumonia They may therefore be used for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, although emergent resistance in Str. pneumoniae limits their use in some parts of the world. In patients with bronchitis the use of macrolides reduces the severity and duration of symptoms. Macrolides have also been used successfully in the treatment of otitis media and sinusitis; combination with sulphonamides may be desirable. They may be effective in eradicating the carrier state of Str. pyogenes, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diptheriae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Macrolides provide alternative therapy for the prophylaxis of recurrent acute rheumatic fever and of infective endocarditis after dental treatment. The cure rate with macrolides of streptococcal skin infections and of minor staphylococcal infections is equal to that achieved with penicillins. In diarrhoea due to Campylobacter jejuni, the administration of macrolides shortens the duration of the faecal excretion of organisms and may give clinical improvement in severe disease. Macrolides are the drugs of choice for infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis in pregnancy and for Haemophilus ducreyi infections. They are effective alternative therapy to benzylpenicillin for the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae and Treponema pallidum infections.
TI  - [Microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. It has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. We measured, using the GA-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. Also activities (expressed in MICs) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Tested organisms included Streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as Gram-positive cocci, and Haemophilus influenzae (1), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Bordetella pertussis (12), Salmonella sp. (4) and Campylobacter jejuni (103) as Gram-negative bacilli. Against stock strains of bacteria, MICs of 10 drugs (RKM, erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), midecamycin acetate (MOM), clindamycin (CLDM), amoxicillin (AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), minocycline, ofloxacin (OFLX] were determined. Against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with RKM, MICs of only 4 drugs (RKM, EM, JM, MOM) were determined. Measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of RKM and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with RKM (dry syrup). Two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with RKM at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Clinical and bacteriological effects of RKM were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28 streptococcal infections, 29 Campylobacter enteritis, 4 Salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. Five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. In the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. Adverse reactions of RKM and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. Obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. The GA-test produced pH values indicating that amounts of gastric acid were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin in pediatric fields].
AB  - We have carried out laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (RKM, TMS-19-Q). The results are summarized as follows. Serum and urinary concentrations of RKM were determined in 6 children with ages between 6 and 12 years given single oral doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. Mean serum concentrations peaked at 30 minutes after administration of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, and respective peak values were 0.30 microgram/ml, 0.79 microgram/ml and 1.32 micrograms/ml. Biological half-lives for 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg were 2.0 hours, 1.65 hours and 1.36 hours. The 6-hour urinary recovery ranged from 1.11% to 2.58% after administration of 5 mg/kg, and the mean 6-hour urinary recoveries were 1.35% after administration of 10 mg/kg and 2.28% after administration of 15 mg/kg. Therapeutic responses were recorded as excellent or good in 22 (73.3%) of the children, comprising 6 with tonsillitis, 2 with pharyngitis, 4 with bronchitis, 1 with bronchopneumonia, 1 with Mycoplasma pneumonia, 2 with whooping cough, 5 with streptococcal infections, 5 with Campylobacter enteritis, 3 with impetigo and 1 with SSSS. The microbiological effectiveness of RKM on identified pathogens comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 5 strains of Campylobacter spp. was not so satisfactory as evidenced by a eradication rate of 50.0%. No significant side effect due to the drug was observed in any cases. In conclusion, RKM was found to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Studies on susceptibility of isolated organisms from pediatric infections against various antimicrobial agents].
AB  - Twelve oral antimicrobial agents were tested for their antimicrobial activities against causative organisms isolated from pediatric infections. Activities of these antimicrobial agents against Streptococcus pyogenes were also examined in relation to T-antigen typing of the species. The results of the investigation are summarized as follows. 1. Against Staphylococcus aureus, rokitamycin (RKM), josamycin, ofloxacin, minocycline exhibited strong antimicrobial activities, and few strains of S. aureus showed resistance to these antimicrobial agents. More strains exhibited resistance to erythromycin (EM) than to other macrolide antibiotics (MLs) examined. Amoxicillin (AMPC)-resistance was often observed also. 2. Against S. pyogenes, beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams) and RKM had MIC80 of 0.20 microgram/ml or below, and no resistant strains of this organism were observed against these antibiotics. Only 2 resistant strains (2.0%) of S. pyogenes to MLs were detected, but resistance to tetracyclines (TCs) was observed at a high frequency, with 71.4% or more strains among T-4, T-6, T-12 and T-28 antigen types exhibited resistance to TCs. Among the 21 strains of T-12 antigen type examined, only one strain (4.8%) was found resistant to MLs. These observations suggested that the reduction in the frequency of ML-resistant strains was not due to the reduction in the number of T-12 antigen type strains but due to losses of resistance factors against MLs of plasmids. 3. Antibacterial activities of beta-lactams and MLs against Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were good, similarly to activities against S. pyogenes. But many strains of S. pneumoniae were resistant to TCs. 4. New quinolone antimicrobial agents (quinolones) showed excellent activities against Branhamella catarrhalis strains with EM and RKM showing the next best activities. The number of resistant strains against quinolones, however, seemed to be on an increase. 5. Quinolones had strong antimicrobial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, few strains of which showed resistance to quinolones. AMPC had the next best activity, but approximately 10% of H. influenzae exhibited resistance to this antibiotic. 6. Against Campylobacter spp., quinolones and MLs showed the best activities with MIC80 values at or below 0.25 microgram/ml, and no resistant strains of the species against these antimicrobial agents were observed. Fosfomycin and TCs showed somewhat inferior activities to quinolones and MLs, with beta-lactams showing still lower activities. 7. Only few strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis were examined, but MLs and TCs appeared to be effective against these organisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A clinical study of rokitamycin in pediatrics].
AB  - A total of 29 patients with pediatric infections was treated orally with 21.4-44.4 mg/kg/day of rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Clinical responses to RKM in 24 evaluable patients were excellent in 2 and good in 3 of 5 patients with tonsillitis and laryngitis; excellent in 3 and good in 5 of 8 patients with bronchitis; excellent in 3, good in 2 and fair in one of 6 patients with bronchopneumonia; excellent in 2 and good in the other of 3 patients with psittacosis; and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with Campylobacter colitis. The overall efficacy rate was 95.8%. 2. Bacteriological responses to the drug were: reduction in 1 and no change in the other of 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes; eradication of a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus; eradication of 2 and no change in 3 of 5 strains of Haemophilus influenzae; and eradication of 2 out of 2 strains of Campylobacter spp. 3. Diarrhea was complained of as an adverse reaction to the RKM medication by 1 patient, abdominal pain was reported by another, and anorexia by another of the 27 patients treated. Laboratory examination was performed on some patients, but not abnormal test values were found except in 1 case showing an increase in platelet count from 27.6 to 78.2 X 10(4)/mm8. The results suggested that RKM dry syrup might be a very useful and safe drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Of the recent isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to RKM than to josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), erythromycin and lincomycin. Also, macrolides (MLs)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to RKM. 2. Recent isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, group G Streptococci, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to RKM than to midecamycin acetate and JM. Oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. T1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first 6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. Fifty-two patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Campylobacter enteritis, etc. were treated with RKM at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. An eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. A side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.
TI  - [Appraisal of rokitamycin in the pediatric field].
AB  - In a study of rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup for its usefulness in pediatric infections, the following results were obtained: 1. Frequencies of RKM-resistant strains among fresh isolates from sick children were very low, and 4.4% of 68 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 4.2% of 48 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and none of 96 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were found to be RKM-resistant. 2. Hypo- to achlorhydria was found in 2 (3.77%) of 53 children. 3. When children were administered once orally with 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg of RKM dry syrup at fasting, mean peak values of plasma concentration were 0.25, 0.55 and 0.74 micrograms/ml with a T1/2 (beta) of 2.18, 1.97 and 2.00 hours, respectively. Urinary recovery rates during the first 0-6 hours were quite low, and values were 1.21, 1.38 and 2.23%, respectively. 4. The clinical efficacy of RKM dry syrup was studied on children chiefly with acute pneumonia, mycoplasmal pneumonia and tonsillitis. Among 379 children from whom pathogens had been determined, responses to the treatment were excellent in 186, good in 144, fair in 24, poor in 20 and unknown in 5 patients, the overall efficacy rate being 88.2%. Among all 598 treated patients, including those with undetermined pathogens, responses were excellent in 247, good in 269, fair in 42, poor in 35 and unknown in 5 patients, the efficacy rate being 87.0%. 5. The clinical efficacy of the drug in treating Chlamydia infection in 12 patients including a Chlamydia carrier and the clinical efficacy in treating Campylobacter enteritis in 36 patients were studied. All the cases showed "good" responses. Among 66 patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia, responses were excellent in 33 and good in 27 patients, with an efficacy rate of 90.9%. 6. The optimal dose of RKM dry syrup seemed to be in the range between 20 and 40 mg/kg. It appeared, however, that a dose of about 40 mg/kg would be required to eradicate the pathogen from the pharynx in S. pyogenes infection. 7. Adverse reactions to RKM dry syrup were found in 9 (1.45%) of 622 patients. The reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms except eruption occurred in 1 patient, but they were all mild. Laboratory examinations revealed eosinophilia in 19 and abnormal hepatic enzyme activities in 8 of 455 patients studied, but such abnormalities were all transient and mild.

TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MICs of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Neisseria sp. and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. The protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. However, urine at pH 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at pH 7.0
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - Demonstration of cross-reactions between pneumococci and alpha-streptococci using gold-labelled mono- and polyclonal antibodies and electron microscopy.
AB  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and the pneumococcal C-polysaccharide  (PnC) were investigated using electron microscopy and immunogold labelling of bacterial cells. Monoclonal antibodies against two different determinants of the PnC molecule were used, one directed against the chain sugar of the repeating unit 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxygalactose (Sug) and the other against the phosphorylcholine residue. Two different immunogold techniques were tested, either by direct labelling of the monoclonal antibody or by using an antimouse immunogold conjugate to demonstrate binding of the monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies against the "Sug" determinant reacted only with pneumococci, whereas antibodies against the phosphorylcholine determinant bound to cross-reacting streptococci as well as to pneumococci. These results indicate that the cross-reacting antigens of the alpha-streptococci contain phosphorylcholine residues, but that they are not identical to the C-polysaccharide molecule.
TI  - Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with and without pharyngitis.
AB  - The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and other treatable organisms was studied in children with and without pharyngitis. Children aged 2 to 12 years were evaluated between November 1985 and April 1986 in three family practice offices in the Salt Lake City area. Chlamydia trachomatis was not detected in the pharynx of any of the children studied. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was cultured from 5 percent of the 242 children studied, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 30 percent, non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 5 percent, Hemophilus influenzae from 4 percent, and Staphylococcus aureus from 14 percent. The symptoms reported were not statistically associated with any organism isolated, and clinical signs of pharyngitis were associated only with the presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Based on these results, management of pharyngitis in children should continue to be based on the detection and treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.
TI  - Host-vector system for integration of recombinant DNA into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
AB  - We describe a genetic system in which transformation of Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant DNA into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetM) 6001 (omega 6001). The element containing the recombinant DNA was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. When Escherichia coli plasmid pDP36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous DNA into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. Genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous DNA caused inactivation of the tetM gene of omega 6001. By analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous DNA was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. It was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of S. pneumoniae, S. sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus faecalis. The omega 6001-pDP36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in streptococci. By this method cloned streptococcal DNA (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.

TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef in comparison to other cephalosporins.
AB  - Flomoxef and cefazolin had nearly the same activity against staphylococci, which  was stronger than that of other cephalosporins. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, cefotaxime and cefazolin were more active than flomoxef, but the other cephamycins were less active than flomoxef. In comparison to the other cephalosporins, latamoxef and flomoxef had higher activity against Branhamella catarrhalis, whereas cefotaxime, latamoxef and cefotetan were more active against Haemophilus influenzae. Flomoxef was the only drug exhibiting activity against Clostridium difficile. The activity of flomoxef and latamoxef against Bacteroides fragilis was stronger than that of the other cephalosporins, but Bacteroides bivius was resistant to each of these antibiotics.
TI  - Aetiology of acute pharyngitis and clinical response to empirical therapy with erythromycin versus amoxicillin.
AB  - One hundred and eighty-nine adults with acute pharyngitis had culture and serological evaluation for group A beta haemolytic streptococci (GABHS), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Sixteen patients had evidence for infection with GABHS, none for M. pneumoniae, and one for B. catarrhalis. For those with GABHS, there was no significant difference between empirical treatment by erythromycin or amoxicillin. For those without GABHS, empirical treatment with erythromycin appeared to result in a statistically significant reduction in cough and a noticeable but less than significant reduction of other symptoms when compared to empirical treatment with amoxicillin. The new formulation of erythromycin utilized in this study (PCE) may be associated with a reduction in gastrointestinal intolerance from that reported with other erythromycin products.

TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of the new macrolide flurithromycin against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The activity of flurithromycin against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus was determined by the agar dilution method. Flurithromycin showed high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90 = 0.032-0.25 mg/l). Its MIC90 value against Haemophilus influenzae strains was 4.0 mg/l and 16 mg/l against Staphylococcus aureus strains. Flurithromycin has promising antibacterial activity which warrants clinical trials.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of common pediatric pathogens to LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a carbacephem antibiotic for oral administration with an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of cefaclor and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. It has greater stability than cefaclor and greater activity against beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. LY163892 is less active than amoxicillin against streptococci and less active than amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against Branhamella catarrhalis but comparable against other pathogens.
TI  - In vivo postantibiotic effect in a thigh infection in neutropenic mice.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. We demonstrated and standardized the in vivo PAE in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. Inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant PAEs. Against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce PAEs against streptococci. With few exceptions the in vivo PAE correlated well with the PAE reported in prior in vitro studies. Residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the PAE. Theoretically, the presence of a PAE may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Induction of murine B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis by some bacterial ribosomes.
AB  - Ribosomal preparations from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were investigated with respect to their activating capacity towards murine lymphoid cells. The proliferation of BALB/c spleen cells was induced in a dose-dependent fashion (from 1 to 100 micrograms/ml) by ribosomes of K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes with a peak activity at 48 or 72 hr of culture. The majority of the blast cells induced by these ribosomal preparations were positive for surface-immunoglobulin (S-Ig) and negative for Thy 1.2. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes ribosomes induced the synthesis of IgM and some IgA. Cell proliferation and induction of IgM production were also demonstrated with the 3 ribosomal preparations using spleen cells from athymic nude (nu+/nu+) mice, Lyb-5-defective CBA/N spleen cells, B cell-enriched and T cell-depleted BALB/c spleen cell suspensions, as well as spleen cells from the Ips gene-deficient C3H/HeJ strain. Cell culture supernatants contained specific anti-ribosome IgM antibodies. Antibodies of other specificities (anti-sheep erythrocytes) were also demonstrated in supernatants from K. pneumoniae-stimulated cultures. Evidence against a possible role of contamination of K. pneumoniae and H. influenzae ribosomes by lipopolysaccharide- or lipid A-associated proteins in this effect is discussed. Ribosomes from S. pneumoniae did not induce 3H-thymidine incorporation nor Ig production. None of the 4 ribosomal preparations was found to stimulate T cell blastogenesis or to induce interleukin-2 production by naive BALB/c spleen cells. Finally, ribosomes from H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae but not those of K. pneumoniae stimulated interleukin-1 production by adherent spleen cells, from BALB/c mice.
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - The immunology of tonsils in children: the effect of bacterial load on the presence of B- and T-cell subsets.
AB  - Tonsil core specimens of 54 children, (3 to 12 years) with clinical evidence of chronic tonsillitis and/or "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy, were studied for the effect of the magnitude of aerobic bacterial load on tonsil size and the absolute numbers of B- and T-cell subsets. Tonsillar core specimens obtained from ten children with no history of ear, nose, or throat infections and normal appearing tonsils served as controls. The findings of this study indicate that tonsil size was directly proportional to the mean bacterial load in colony forming units/g tonsil (CFU/g) even in the absence of a clinical history of infection (p less than 0.01). A mean bacterial load of 2.4 +/- 2.1 X 10(5) CFU/g tonsil was seen in diseased tonsils as compared to 1.6 +/- 2.4 X 10(4) CFU/g tonsil in normal controls (p less than 0.01). Hemophilus influenzae (type B and non-B), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were the most common pathogens recovered in the largest numbers from diseased tonsils; control tonsils harbored few bacteria in their cores. The absolute number of immunocompetent cells/g tonsil including T-helper, T-suppressor and B-cells (S-Ig+), were significantly greater in diseased tonsils than in controls (p less than 0.001). Increasing microbial load (CFU/g tonsil) correlated with increased numbers of T-helper (p less than 0.01) and B-cells (p less than 0.01). These data strongly support a bacterial etiology for chronic tonsillitis as well as "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy. Bacterial induced proliferation of immunocompetent cells may be one underlying mechanism for chronic tonsillar disease in children.
TI  - Correlation of in vitro activities of the fluoroquinolones to their in vivo efficacies.
AB  - The new fluoroquinolones have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In order to differentiate between the compounds, the authors have compared their in vitro activities and correlated these results with their in vivo efficacies. Norfloxacin (N), pefloxacin (P), enoxacin (E), ofloxacin (O), difloxacin (D), ciprofloxacin (C), fleroxacin (F), A-61827 (A), temafloxacin (T) and lomefloxacin (L) were used in these studies. In vitro, C was the most active compound against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and A was the most active compound against Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. In mouse protection tests, C, D, A, O, T and F had similar activities against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D, T and A were the most active quinolones against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and Strep. pneumoniae in mouse protection tests. D was the most active agent against intracellular infection with Salmonella typhimurium, followed by O, T, A and F. The other compounds were ineffective in this test. All the quinolones were effective in treating E. coli pyelonephritis in mice. The doses required to treat P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis in mice were four times greater than those required to treat E. coli. Resistant P. aeruginosa mutants could be isolated from the kidneys after quinolone treatment. Systemic infections with E. coli, Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa in neutropenic mice required high doses of the fluoroquinolones and F, T and A were ineffective at doses of 100 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa in this model. Differences in in vitro potencies were not reflected in in vivo efficacies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Bacterial lysis of fibrin seal in vitro.
AB  - We performed an in vitro study to determine whether certain bacteria may lyse a commercially available fibrin seal (Beriplast, Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG). Fibrinogen solution was mixed with actively growing bacterial cultures, and thrombin was added. During 20 days of incubation at 37 degrees C complete lysis was observed with a number of different bacteria, however, at different rates. Complete lysis within 1-5 days was observed for the following species (number of strains in parentheses): Streptococcus faecalis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Serratia marcescens (2), and Serratia liquefaciens (1). Lysis was observed after 6-10 days for Enterobacter cloacae (2), Morganella morganii (2), Escherichia coli (2), S. marcescens (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). Lysis after 11-16 days was observed for Streptococcus pyogenes (2), S. faecalis (2), and Staphylococcus aureus (2). Rapid lysis was associated with the ability of the strain to liquefy gelatin, i.e. the production of a protease.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies with azithromycin (CP-62,993), a new macrolide with an extended half-life and excellent tissue distribution.
AB  - Azithromycin (CP-62,993), a new acid-stable 15-membered-ring macrolide, was well  absorbed following oral administration in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. This compound exhibited a uniformly long elimination half-life and was distributed exceptionally well into all tissues. This extravascular penetration of azithromycin was demonstrated by tissue/plasma area-under-the-curve ratios ranging from 13.6 to 137 compared with ratios for erythromycin of 3.1 to 11.6. The significance of these pharmacokinetic advantages of azithromycin over erythromycin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models. Azithromycin was orally effective in treating middle ear infections induced in gerbils by transbulla challenges with amoxicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae or susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; erythromycin failed and cefaclor was only marginally active against the H. influenzae challenge. Azithromycin was equivalent to cefaclor and erythromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae. In mouse models, the new macrolide was 10-fold more potent than erythromycin and four other antibiotics against an anaerobic infection produced by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Similarly, azithromycin was effective against established tissue infections induced by Salmonella enteritidis (liver and spleen) and Staphylococcus aureus (thigh muscle); erythromycin failed against both infections. The oral and subcutaneous activities of azithromycin, erythromycin, and cefaclor were similar against acute systemic infections produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, or S. aureus, whereas azithromycin was more potent than erythromycin and cefaclor against the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. The pharmacokinetic advantage of azithromycin over erythromycin in half-life was clearly demonstrated in prophylactic treatment of an acute mouse model of S. aureus infection. These properties of azithromycin strongly support the further evaluation of this new macrolide for use in community-acquired infections of skin or soft tissue and respiratory diseases.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of roxithromycin, erythromycin, and clindamycin against selected gram-positive bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Recent experimental work has shown that a so-called PAE (postantibiotic effect, i.e. persistent suppression of regrowth after short exposure of bacteria to the study drug in vitro) is a feature of most current antibiotics. However, marked quantitative differences were found between different types of antibiotics and also between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms studied. A PAE has not yet been demonstrated for roxithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic. Therefore, we compared the PAE of roxithromycin, erythromycin, and clindamycin against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae in vitro. Identical multiples of the MIC and identical exposure times resulted in similar PAEs for the three study drugs tested. Good correlations could be found between the area under the in-vitro concentration-vs-time curve (AUC) and PAEs. The longest PAE of 9.6 h was observed after exposure of Str. pneumoniae to 1.9 mg/l of roxithromycin for 6 h.
TI  - In-vitro activity of roxithromycin against respiratory and skin pathogens.
AB  - The activity of roxithromycin was determined by a microdilution method, in comparison with erythromycin, spiramycin and josamycin. Roxithromycin and erythromycin showed very similar MICs against staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. In most cases, spiramycin and josamycin appeared similarly or more active. The activity of roxithromycin against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydia psittaci and, to some extent, against Pasteurella spp. was also assessed, by suitable in-vitro methods. Roxithromycin has a promising potential for treating selected skin and respiratory infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the oral cephalosporin BMY-28100.
AB  - BMY-28100 was compared with cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram and found to be more active than the reference cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium difficile. BMY-28100 was the next most active, after cefteram, against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BMY-28100 showed similar activity to that of cefaclor. The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100, including bactericidal activity, against Staphylococcus aureus was less affected by penicillinase-production than was that of cefaclor. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against various types of penicillinases, especially against the penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of A-56268 against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-2588, a new oral cephalosporin, compared with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - T-2588, the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of T-2525, [6R, 7R]-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetoamido] -3- [(5-methyl-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)methyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, is a new oral cephalosporin. T-2525 had a widely expanded antibacterial spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. T-2525 was more active in vitro than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Moreover, it exhibited superior in vitro activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. T-2525 was highly stable to various beta-lactamases, which were classified as Richmond and Sykes types Ia, Ib, Ic, III, IV, and Vc. It had high affinities for the lethal (essential) penicillin-binding proteins of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis. T-2588 had excellent therapeutic effect on systemic infections in mice with various species of gram-negative bacteria, including beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
TI  - Interactions of fibronectin with streptococci: the role of fibronectin as a receptor for Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Current evidence suggests that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes is centrally involved in the adherence of these bacteria to the oral mucosa. The major receptor on the surface of buccal mucosal cells for S. pyogenes is fibronectin. Fibronectin is a complex glycoprotein found in blood, extracellular matrices, and saliva. Many species of streptococci bind to fibronectin, although the characteristics of these interactions are different. Furthermore, whereas LTA is an efficient inhibitor of the binding of fibronectin to group A streptococci, it has little ability to inhibit the binding of fibronectin to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. Studies conducted with fibronectin show that different bacteria bind to different sites. The ability of various bacteria to interact with different domains on the fibronectin molecule may play an important role in bacterial adherence and tissue tropism.
TI  - Comparative efficacies of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole and cefaclor in acute otitis media: a double blind randomized trial.
AB  - A prospective double blind trial compared the fixed combination of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (E/S) with cefaclor in the treatment of acute otitis media. One hundred nineteen children in six centers across Canada were studied. Diagnostic tympanocentesis of 134 ears yielded 135 bacterial isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (42%); Haemophilus influenzae (21%); Branhamella catarrhalis (10%); Streptococcus pyogenes (5%); and other bacteria (22%). Seventy-seven percent of strains of B. catarrhalis and 14% of strains of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. E/S exhibited greater in vitro activity against H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis. Twenty-three patients had bacteriologically sterile middle ear fluid. The overall clinical outcome at Days 10 and 31 was identical in both treatment groups. Otoscopic findings improved more rapidly in the E/S group than in the cefaclor group at 10 and 31 days (P less than or equal to 0.04). In cases where pre-treatment middle ear fluid was negative on routine bacterial culture, complete cure at 10 days was observed in 75% of patients treated with E/S but only in 14% of those treated with cefaclor (P = 0.02). Side effects were infrequent and comparable between the test drugs. E/S is at least as effective as cefaclor in the management of acute otitis media and may be superior, particularly for cases not yielding bacteria on routine culture.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of acute otitis media in children. Therapeutic consequences].
AB  - One hundred children presenting with acute otitis media underwent a bacteriological study of otitis exudate over a 18 month period. The bacteria found were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Haemophilus influenzae (19), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (7), Branhamella catarrhalis (3), and 18 Gram negative bacilli (including 7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 enterobacteriaceae). One pathogenic bacterium was isolated in 56 cases, 2 or more in 12 cases and none in 32 cases. In the age categories 0-1 year (47 cases) and 1-3 years (31 cases), S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the main organisms found, followed by S. pyogenes in children older than 3 years (22 cases). With respect to the antibiotics used for treating otitis, 5/22 S. pneumoniae and 4/17 H. influenzae were erythromycin resistant (9/17 had an intermediate susceptibility) and 7/19 H. influenzae and 1/17 S. pneumoniae were cotrimoxazole resistant. None of the S. pneumoniae and 2/19 H. influenzae were ampicillin resistant. These 2 H. influenzae and 2/3 B. catarrhalis were beta-lactamase producers. They were sensitive to the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - Predictive value of nasal bacterial culture for etiological agents in acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Nasal secretion, aspiration yield and lavage content from the sinus were studied  for bacteria in 175 patients (247 sinuses) with acute maxillary sinusitis. The same pathogen was cultured from the nose and aspiration fluid in 91% of cases of acute purulent sinusitis. This indicated a significant predictive value of the nasal bacteriological culture for presence of pathogenic bacteria in the sinus in purulent cases. In cases with no growth of pathogens in the aspirate, the nasal culture showed pathogenic bacteria in about 50%. Examination of the aspiration fluid may occasionally give false negative result in purulent maxillary sinusitis (at least 3% in the present series). In these cases, culture of the irrigation yield may prove helpful.
TI  - A two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  - There are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.
TI  - Activity of A-56268 compared with that of erythromycin and other oral agents against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-56268 was compared with erythromycin, roxithromycin (RU 28965), and perorally administered antimicrobial agents. Its in vitro activity was similar to that of erythromycin and slightly greater than that of roxithromycin, with beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae inhibited by less than 2 micrograms of A-56268 per ml (50% inhibited by 0.06 microgram/ml). Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. Pneumoniae, and S. faecalis resistant to erythromycin were resistant to A-56268, and 4 micrograms/ml inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide, compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against selected gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of A-56268 was determined and compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against a limited spectrum of 401 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. A-56268 was quite active against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci and was moderately active against Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. A-56268 was consistently bactericidal only for S. pneumoniae. The activity of A-56268 was comparable to that of erythromycin against most organisms tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CI934, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with coumermycin, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Cl934, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, was studied  against 314 strains of Gram-positive bacteria representing 6 genera: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. milleri, viridans streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Bacillus spp.; and compared with that of enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ampicillin, coumermycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifapentine, LM 427, erythromycin, minocycline, tetracycline and clindamycin. The agar dilution method was used. Cl934 was very active in vitro, with MIC90 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l against most species tested, except for S. faecalis and M. fortuitum. It was usually 2 to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. Cl934 was also tested by the killing curve method, alone and in combination with coumermycin. It was rapidly bactericidal against most species tested, including S. faecalis. A synergistic interaction was observed with coumermycin against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. milleri and S. faecalis. The only antagonistic interaction occurred against L. monocytogenes exposed to 8 X MIC of Cl934 with 2 X MIC of coumermycin.
TI  - Relapse of acute purulent otitis media: antibiotic sensitivities of nasopharyngeal pathogens.
AB  - The present investigation was conducted to find out if a relapse of acute purulent otitis media is associated with a decreased sensitivity of nasopharyngeal pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents. All but one of 63 children with relapse included in this study yielded one or more of the classical middle ear pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, S. pyogenes) in their nasopharynx (NPH) secretions. S. pneumoniae was the predominating isolate from NPH (71% of the patients) as well as from middle ear effusion (53%). At a control visit 4 weeks after the start of antibiotic therapy, 91% were NPH carriers of potential pathogens and S. pneumoniae was still the most common isolate (53%). Beta-lactamase was produced by 55% of B. catarrhalis isolates from the NPH specimens on the first visit, but only by 33% of B. catarrhalis isolates on the control visit. Two NPH isolates of H. influenzae produced beta-lactamase. One isolate of S. pneumoniae (serotype 18) was intermediately sensitive to phenoxymethylpenicillin. Generally low MICs were found for erythromycin and cefaclor. H. influenzae isolates were generally sensitive to ampicillin in vitro, but only 1 isolate was fully sensitive to erythromycin. B. catarrhalis isolates were uniformly sensitive to doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. No tolerance to penicillin was demonstrated in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. The present data indicate that the relapse of acute otitis media is not associated with development of tolerance or resistance to therapeutic antimicrobials commonly used.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - Opsonic and physicochemical characteristics of intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - The composition and opsonizing activity of five commercially available immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use (Venoglobulin I, Venilon, Gammagard, Polyglobin, and Sandoglobulin) were studied. The composition of these preparations does not differ very much as far as total protein, immunoglobulin class and IgG subclass concentrations are concerned. The only exceptions were that Veniglobulin I, Gammagard and Sandoglobulin contain IgA, which might cause side effects in patients with anti-IgA antibodies, Gammagard contains very little IgG4, and Venilon and Polyglobin contain no and almost no IgG3, respectively, which might explain their very low opsonic activity. It was found that Venilon and Gammagard activate complement in the ready-for-infusion state. The opsonic activity of Venoglobulin I, Sandoglobulin and Gammagard is about equal to that of inactivated serum: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli with K antigen, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus group B are well opsonized and E. coli without K antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae are poorly opsonized.
TI  - Chemotherapy of otitis media with ofloxacin.
AB  - This study evaluated the therapeutic role of ofloxacin in different forms of otitis media. After identifying the infecting bacteria in 250 patients with acute otitis media, or chronic otitis media, the clinical efficacy of orally administered ofloxacin 200mg twice daily was assessed in 45 patients from each of these groups. The clinical results were comparable with those obtained after conventional local and oral antibiotic therapy. Microbiological examination of the ear secretions revealed Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae to be the main pathogens in acute otitis media, whereas in chronic otitis media P. aeruginosa and Proteus sp. were detected in most of the cases. Ofloxacin concentrations in secretions and mucosa specimens of the middle ear exceeded serum concentrations by more than 2-fold. On the basis of these preliminary results, ofloxacin appears to be an effective orally administered agent, without ototoxicity, which is effective against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, 2 important pathogens in middle ear infections. Ofloxacin should be considered as an alternative for the therapy of otitis media, especially the chronic forms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of A-56268 (TE-031), the 6-O-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. A-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. A-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and Propionibacterium acnes, for which A-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. The MBC of A-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the MIC against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and H. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the MICs for some Staphylococcus aureus strains. Human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of A-56268 or erythromycin. A-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being more active at pH 8.0 than at the physiologic pH of 7.3. The activity of A-56268 was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of H. influenzae. In mouse protection tests, when administered orally A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. After subcutaneous administration the potencies of A-56268 and erythromycin were not statistically different from each other. A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against Legionella infection in guinea pigs. The concentration of A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In mice, the peak levels in serum of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for A-56268 after oral administration. The serum half-life of A-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.
TI  - Viral and bacterial organisms associated with acute pharyngitis in a school-aged  population.
AB  - To investigate the causes and clinical characteristics of acute pharyngitis among school-aged children (4 to 18 years), we obtained throat cultures for respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, and Chlamydia trachomatis from 320 patients with sore throat and 308 controls without respiratory complaints. The study was conducted from January to April 1985 in a private pediatric practice in central New York State. Sixty percent of the patients and 26% of the control subjects had positive cultures for at least one organism. Forty percent of patients had positive cultures for group A streptococcus, compared with 11.9% of the controls. Fifty (16%) patients had positive viral cultures, compared with eight (2.6%) controls; the predominant viral isolate was influenza A Philippines. Patients infected with influenza A were significantly more likely to complain of cough and hoarseness, and were less likely to have pharyngeal exudate or tender cervical adenopathy, than were patients who had positive cultures for group A streptococcus. Although 49 (15.8%) patients with acute pharyngitis had cultures positive for M. pneumoniae, 53 (17.6%) asymptomatic controls were also had M. pneumoniae-positive cultures. Thus detection of M. pneumoniae in the throat of school-aged children with pharyngitis may not be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of disease caused by this organism. C. trachomatis was not isolated from any patient or control.
TI  - The ability to sensitize host cells for destruction by autologous complement is a general property of lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Streptococcus pneumoniae binds to erythrocytes and renders them susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. The present study was performed to determine whether LTA from two other gram-positive bacterial species had the ability to render mammalian cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. Human erythrocytes were sensitized with LTA from S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Lactobacillus fermentum. Under incubation in normal autologous serum, lysis was observed with each of the LTA-sensitized erythrocyte preparations. When erythrocytes from a C2-deficient patient were sensitized with the LTA preparations and then incubated in autologous, C2-deficient serum, the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pyogenes or L. fermentum LTA demonstrated relatively little lysis, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pneumoniae LTA yielded near-total lysis. After reconstitution of the C2-deficient serum with purified human C2, lysis was observed with all three LTA preparations. When erythrocytes from an agammaglobulinemic patient were sensitized with either the S. pyogenes or the L. fermentum LTA, they were not lysed in the presence of autologous agammaglobulinemic serum, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pneumoniae LTA were completely lysed. Serum obtained from the agammaglobulinemic patient after reconstitution with intravenous pooled gamma globulin was able to lyse autologous erythrocytes sensitized with each of the three LTA preparations. These results demonstrate that the ability to render host cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement is a general property of LTA. Whether activation of the autologous complement occurs by the classical or alternative pathways and whether it is antibody dependent depends on the nature of the bacterial LTA.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of L-105, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - L-105 (sodium(-)-(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino- acetamido]-3-[1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-aza bicyclo [4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate) is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative. The in-vitro antibacterial activity of L-105 against clinical isolates of 18 bacterial species was compared with those of cefmenoxime, cefoperazone and cefazolin. Its spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria was similar to that of cefmenoxime. Moreover, against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus faecalis, Str. pneumoniae and Str. pyogenes, L-105 was more potent than cefmenoxime and cefoperazone. Against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staph. aureus which is comparatively resistant to most third-generation cephalosporins, it was nearly equal in potency to cefazolin. L-105 was stable to various penicillinases and cephalosporinases. However, this compound was slightly hydrolyzed by oxyiminocephalosporinases, i.e., the enzymes produced by Pseudomonas cepacia and Ps. maltophilia.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [A study of concentration of ampicillin into middle ear effusion after administration of bacampicillin].
AB  - We studied the concentration of ampicillin (ABPC) into middle ear effusions after administration of bacampicillin (BAPC). Nine patients with acute purulent otitis media were given orally single doses of the drug at a level of 10 mg/kg, and concentrations of ABPC which is the active antibiotic metabolite of BAPC were determined in middle ear effusions periodically after the administration. Bacteria present in effusions were identified, and their ability to produce beta-lactamase was also determined. ABPC concentrations in middle ear effusions were inversely related to the ability of bacteria detected from the intratympanic cavity to produce beta-lactamase. ABPC concentrations in middle ear effusions from which only beta-lactamase negative organisms were detected were higher by 5.2- and 2.3- fold at 60 and 120 minutes after the administration of BAPC, respectively, than those in effusions from which beta-lactamase positive organisms were detected. ABPC concentrations achieved in middle ear effusions in cases where only beta-lactamase negative organisms were detected exceeded MIC80's of the drug against main causative bacteria of acute purulent otitis media such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae. Because only 10% or less of these species produces beta-lactamase, BAPC appears to be one of the highly effective drugs in the treatment of this disease.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - Role of interferon in streptococcal infection in the mouse.
AB  - In previous studies, we have shown the rapid in vitro induction of IFN gamma from human T cells by highly purified peptic extracts of M proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes. The present report extends these in vitro studies and shows that a mixture of both alpha/beta and gamma IFN were present in spleen cell homogenates after in vivo treatment with M protein wild-type (M+) or mutant (M-) S. pyogenes strains. The levels of bacterial-induced IFN were found to be greater in M+ treated animals. Additional studies in vivo showed that pretreatment of mice with heat-killed M+ S. pyogenes organisms significantly protected mice to pneumococcal infection compared to similarly treated M- or control animals (P less than 0.001). Further, antibodies to mouse IFN alpha/beta and antibodies specific to a synthetic N-terminal peptide of mouse IFN gamma enhanced the death of animals due to pneumococcal infection and blocked the protection observed in animals previously treated with heat-killed M+ organisms. Most importantly, treatment of mice with either type of IFN alone enhanced the survival of mice to levels similar to that observed by treatment with M+ organisms (P less than 0.05). The results strongly suggest that IFN can play a crucial role, directly or indirectly, in controlling infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae and perhaps other streptococci.
TI  - Meningitis complicating acute bacteremic facial cellulitis.
AB  - Eighty cases of acute bacteremic facial cellulitis, 34 buccal and 46 preseptal, were reviewed from the years 1977 through 1982. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and course of cellulitis in these two locations were similar. The white blood cell count was over 15,000 in three-fourths of the patients. Haemophilus influenzae type b was cultured from the blood of 67 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae from 12 and Streptococcus pyogenes from 1. Seven patients had culture-proved meningitis, six with H. influenzae type b and one with S. pneumoniae. Five of these patients had sparse clinical evidence of meningitis, and three of these had meningitis apparent by culture only. We conclude that meningitis may occur in association with acute bacteremic facial cellulitis and may be inapparent both clinically and by initial laboratory examination. We suggest aggressive initial evaluation and treatment of these infants pending culture results.
TI  - [Determination of the bactericidal potency of cefatrizine and other oral antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes].
AB  - The in vitro determination of the T log and the minimal bactericidal time of cefatrizine was evaluated against H. influenzae, Str. pyogenes A isolated from clinical specimens. and K. pneumonia ATCC 10031 and compared with that of amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefroxadine and miocamycin against the same bacterial strains. Cefatrizine demonstrate the shorter TMB against all bacterial strains and antibiotic tested with MBCs.
TI  - Effects of carbon dioxide upon the in vitro activity of erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae was examined by agar dilution and agar diffusion methods. The plates were incubated in air alone or in 8% CO2 and air. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) measured in air alone were lower for most of the isolates, compared to those found in 8% CO2. The greatest differences in MIC values were found for H. influenzae; the MIC 50% was 0.5 mg/l in air and 4 mg/l in 8% CO2. Sensitivity testing by the agar diffusion method (ICS) showed considerable differences between results obtained in air and in 8% CO2; the inhibition zones were generally smaller in CO2. The most marked reduction in zone sizes after incubation in 8% CO2 was seen with the H. influenzae isolates; 15 out of 43 isolates moved from the "sensitive" to "moderately sensitive" group. Sensitivity determination of aerobic bacteria for erythromycin should be performed in air alone in the routine laboratory.
TI  - Acute epiglottitis in adults. An eight-year experience in the state of Rhode Island.
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the medical records on all cases of acute epiglottitis in adults from each of the hospitals in Rhode Island and from the state medical examiner's office over an eight-year period (1975-1982). We found 56 cases--an annual incidence of 9.7 cases per million adults. A significant increase occurred in the last two study years. Indirect laryngoscopy proved to be more reliable in making a diagnosis than did x-ray films of the neck; all of 41 indirect examinations were performed without complications. Twenty-three percent (6 of 26) of patients in whom blood cultures had been obtained had bacteremia, all with Hemophilus influenzae. Bacteremia was associated with a high risk of airway obstruction. Four patients died, all from acute airway obstruction, for a mortality rate of 7.1 percent--a rate significantly higher than the current rate among children. Two deaths occurred after admission, while the patients were being observed without an artificial airway. We conclude that the incidence of epiglottitis in adults is higher than previously believed and may be increasing. Fatal airway obstruction can occur without warning, indicating a need for early protection of the airway in adults as well as in children.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of once daily ceftriaxone for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Fifty-seven patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with once daily ceftriaxone. After an initial loading dose of 100 mg/kg, the patients received 80 mg/kg as a single daily dose. Etiologic agents included: Haemophilus influenzae type b, 37 (11 beta-lactamase-positive); Neisseria meningitidis, 11; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Haemophilus influenzae type f, 1; and Group B Streptococcus, 1. All patients showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. Satisfactory cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal activity and drug concentrations were seen 24 hours after a dose even in those patients in whom repeat spinal taps were carried out following the last dose of therapy. The drug was well-tolerated and the major adverse effect seen was diarrhea in 20.4% of the patients. The diarrhea was mild and self-limited and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug although it was frequently associated with alterations in the stool microbiologic flora. Based on this preliminary experience, ceftriaxone, when given in a single daily dose, appears safe and effective in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in nonneonatal infants and children.
TI  - Coumermycin: in vitro activity against 251 clinical isolates of bacteria compared with the activities of eight other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin G and vancomycin. A total of 251 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by an agar dilution method. Clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. All the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. Netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active against S. epidermidis than against S. aureus. The MICs of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin G and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. Coumermycin showed poor activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and enterococci. Most of the S. pneumoniae isolates had also high MICs, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.

AB  
TI  - [Microbial associations in chronic respiratory tract diseases].
AB  - In the peripheral blood of patients with chronic bronchitis the presence of Mycobacterium pneumoniae antigens has been registered in 20.0% of cases and the presence of group A Streptococcus haemolyticus antigens, in 24.0% of cases, the transformation of streptococci into the L-form being observed in 12.0% of cases. The presence of M. pneumoniae, streptococci and their L-forms, as well as associations of these microorganisms, is characteristic of patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis, which is, probably, one of the reasons for the maintenance of bronchial obstruction. In patients with chronic pneumonia and fibrosing alveolitis the antigens of the bacterial form of streptococcus and its L-forms have been detected only in a few cases.
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in Hungary.
AB  - This survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by Public Health Network laboratories in 1983. Facultatively pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except Escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. Oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against Staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. In contrast to other streptococci, all Streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. The majority of the Gram-positive strains were resistant to tetracycline. A comparison to results reported earlier (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. Resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of Proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. Emergence of Haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of P. mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. The increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. In some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. A restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. Multiresistant Gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in Hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a representative clinical material. The frequent occurrence of multiresistant P. mirabilis and Acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. Surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant E. coli strains was very low. Amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.
TI  - [Respiratory tract infections--clinical results with ofloxacin].
AB  - In an open clinical trial, out-patients with respiratory tract infections were given 200 mg ofloxacin b. i. d. orally. 36 had acute bronchitis and pneumonia was diagnosed in 44. The average duration of therapy was nine days for bronchitis and 12 days for pneumonia. In the sputum of bronchitis patients, Haemophilus influenzae (n = 25), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 18), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2) and Pasteurella multocida (n = 1) were isolated. 17 H. influenzae and 12 S. pneumoniae were eliminated. All 20 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from patients with pneumonia were eliminated. A cure or improvement of clinical symptoms was seen in 32 of 36 cases of bronchitis and in 33 of 44 cases of pneumonia treated with ofloxacin.
TI  - A comparative study of cefadroxil and co-trimoxazole in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The most common causative pathogens in lower respiratory disease are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. pyogenes. Cefadroxil and co-trimoxazole, both orally administered broad spectrum antibiotics, are effective against these organisms when given in a twice-daily regimen. In this open randomised study, 42 patients with lower respiratory tract infections received cefadroxil 1 g or co-trimoxazole 1 double-strength tablet every 12 hours for a mean duration of 11 and 13 days, respectively. Pathogens were isolated in the pre-treatment sputum of 51% of patients given cefadroxil and in 25% of those who received co-trimoxazole. Similar overall cure rates were observed after treatment with cefadroxil (67%) and co-trimoxazole (60%); sputum purulence was similarly diminished by both drugs (91% and 85%, respectively). Neither antibiotic caused serious side effects. Thus, in a convenient twice-daily regimen, cefadroxil and co-trimoxazole are comparably effective in treating lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - The aetiology of purulent meningitis in highland children: a bacteriological study.
AB  - Of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  March 1980 to September 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. Other pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), Streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella species (1 of each). Among H. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype I or II. Infections due to non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). Of 67 S. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml. The commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). No resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of H. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. The known case fatality rate in this study was 37%. More children with pneumococcal infection died (46%) than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than twelve months. There is an urgent need for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Orally absorbable cephalosporin antibiotics. 3. Preparation of biologically active R isomer of 7-(3-benzothienylglycylamido)deacetoxycephalosporanic acid.
AB  - The methyl and isopropyl esters of (RS)-3-benzothienylglycine were resolved with  (+)- and (-)-tartaric acid in acetonitrile to give the corresponding R and S salts. The R-salt 4 was hydrolyzed to (R)-3-benzothienylglycine (5). The amino group in 5 was protected with the Boc function and the protected R amino acid 6 coupled with the p-NB ester of 7-ADCA to give the diprotected cephalosporin 7. After removal of the Boc and p-NB groups, the R isomer of 7-(3-benzothienylglycylamido)deacetoxycephalosporanic acid (1) was obtained. The p-NB ester of epimeric cephalosporin 7 was separated by preparative chromatography into R and S isomers. After removal of the protective groups, the S epimer was isolated. The comparison of antibacterial activity of the R and S epimers and the RS mixture of cephalosporin 1 is reported.
TI  - The pharmacokinetic and bactericidal characteristics of oral cefixime.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of cefixime (FK 027), a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, were assessed in 12 normal subjects after single oral doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg. Mean peak serum concentrations were 1.02, 1.46, 2.63, and 3.85 micrograms/ml after the four respective doses. Respective mean serum levels at 12 hours were 0.16, 0.33, 0.72, and 1.13 micrograms/ml. Volumes of distribution averaged 0.1 L/kg body weight, and the elimination t1/2 was 3 hours for all doses. The AUC was 7.01, 11.4, 22.5, and 36.4 micrograms X hr/ml for the four doses, respectively. Serum clearance averaged 0.4 mg/min/kg and mean 24-hour urinary recovery was 21%, 19%, 20%, and 16% for the four respective doses. Serum bactericidal titers at 4 hours exceeded 1:16 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Hemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urine bactericidal titers exceeded 1:8 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae resistant to the available oral cephalosporins.
TI  - Are the tonsils and adenoids a reservoir of infection in otitis media with effusion (glue ear)?
AB  - In a prospective investigation of the treatment of glue ear in children, the possible role of persistent infection in the tonsils and adenoids was assessed by comparing bacterial cultures of swabs and resected tissue from the tonsils and adenoids of patients with cultures of swabs from similar sites in control subjects without ENT abnormality. For almost all potential pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between patients and controls. The same was true of Streptococcus pyogenes in tonsil specimens, while in adenoid specimens rather more isolates were obtained in patients than controls. This difference was just statistically significant at the 5% level, but only when all isolations, including very scanty growths, were compared. On present evidence, persistent infection should not be invoked to explain the success of adenoidectomy in otitis media with effusion or to justify adenotonsillectomy.
TI  - A preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in Nigeria.
AB  - The aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in Nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. In parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. The aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included Streptococcus salivarius, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermides. In general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. An analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. There was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load in mother's milk. Milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of S 6472 (sustained release preparation of cefaclor) in the pediatric field].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on S 6472 were carried out and following results were obtained. Serum concentrations after single oral administration showed 2 peaks at 1 or 2 hours and 5 or 6 hours in the cases with normal meal. Namely this drug has much more maintenance of serum concentration than normal cefaclor. In maintenance of serum concentrations after the administration, there were no obviously difference between normal and heavy meal. S 6472 was administered twice a day to 7 patients with various infections (bronchopneumonia 2 cases, acute bronchitis 1 case, purulent tonsillitis 4 cases) and clinical responses were all effective results. Pathogenic bacteria of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and H. influenzae were completely eliminated in all cases. No significant side effects were observed. On the above results, this administration method of S 6472 twice a day was considered to be good response against mild or moderate bacterial infections in children.
TI  - The detection of streptococcal antigens using monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Recent advances in hybridoma technology have allowed the development of homogeneous immunologic reagents of defined specificity, activity, and reproducibility. During the last few years, the number of monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria has increased exponentially, and research investigations have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibody technology offers a rapid, specific diagnosis of bacterial infection, long before culture results are available. We have described the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) infections in mothers and infants at risk to develop invasive GBS disease. Specifically, we have used the anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to detect GBS colonization, serotype bacterial isolates in the laboratory, and identify GBS antigens in body fluid specimens. We have also discussed the use of anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to confer protection against fatal infection in mice. Monoclonal antibodies against group A streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been developed with the potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious and often life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. With further refinements in monoclonal antibody technology in the future, streptococcal hybridomas may replace standard culture techniques for bacterial identification in the microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Bacteriological features and chemotherapy of adult acute purulent otitis media.
AB  - Eighty-eight patients from 16 to 79 years old, with acute purulent otitis media,  were bacteriologically examined at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of a primary care hospital in Tokyo from July 1979 to May 1983. Fifty-six patients underwent paracentesis, and 32 patients exhibited otorrhea due to previous spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane. Bacteriologic cultures revealed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (62.5 per cent), including S. pneumoniae Type III (28.1 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae (10.5 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus (11.5 per cent), and Streptococcus pyogenes (7.3 per cent). S. pneumoniae Type III had a notably high detection rate in patients from 50 to 79 years old (50-75 per cent). Because Haemophilus influenzae was detected at a relatively high rate in patients of all ages, if can be considered as a major causative pathogen of AOM. In 44 patients, selected mainly from those who underwent paracentesis, a comparative study of bacteria found in middle ear fluid and naso-pharyngeal mucus revealed the same bacteria in 43 out of 44 cases (97.7 per cent), indicating the presence of bacterial infection through the auditory canal. Antibiotics were selected according to an Expected Efficacy Index (EEI), the antibiotic of first choice being Ampicillin or Cefaclor.
TI  - Molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B  (MLS) in streptococci.
AB  - Resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. Genes coding for MLS resistance are located on plasmids and one MLS resistance transposon has been described. MLS resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. Plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (Mdal) that code either for MLS or for both MLS and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Streptococcus faecalis) and G. These plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). One smaller non-conjugative MLS resistance plasmid has been isolated from Str. sanguis (4.5 Mdal). In group D (Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) streptococci, MLS resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). These multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. The MLS resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of Str. faecalis, are located on a transposon of 3.3 Mdal, Tn917. Hybridization studies, with MLS determinants as probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne MLS resistance sequences. Elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including MLS) in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Str. bovis), F, G, Str. pneumoniae, Str. mitis, Str. sanguis and Str. milleri. Strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid DNA. In some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. Such elements, from Str. pyogenes and Str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.
TI  - Prospective randomized comparison of imipenem/cilastatin and cefotaxime for treatment of lung, soft tissue, and renal infections.
AB  - Thirty-one moderately or severely ill hospitalized patients with proved (25 patients) or suspected (six) bacterial infections were randomly allocated to receive imipenem/cilastatin (16) or cefotaxime (15). The median age, sex, duration of therapy, underlying disease, and types of infection were similar in both groups. Nineteen patients with pneumonia, eight with soft tissue infection, and four with acute pyelonephritis were included. The pathogens isolated included Escherichia coli (six), Streptococcus pneumoniae (five), Streptococcus pyogenes (five), Haemophilus species (four), Proteus species (three), Staphylococcus aureus (three), and Serratia marcescens (two). In the imipenem/cilastatin group, 13 patients were cured of their infections and three showed improvement. In the cefotaxime group, nine were cured, three showed improvement, and three showed no improvement. Nine patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin developed phlebitis, as compared with eight treated with cefotaxime. One patient treated with cefotaxime developed diarrhea. During therapy, potential pathogens were isolated from four patients in the imipenem/cilastatin group (Candida species [two] and Pseudomonas maltophilia [two]), as compared with eight in the cefotaxime group (enterococci [two], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [two], Candida species [two], Acinetobacter anitratus [one], and Pseudomonas fluorescens [one]). There were no recognized superinfections.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization.
AB  - The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was studied in 127 patients with roentgenologically verified pneumonia who needed hospitalization. Etiology was determined on the basis of a positive blood culture and/or a significant antibody titer increase. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the probable etiological agent in 69 patients, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in five patients, Streptococcus pyogenes in two patients, and Legionella pneumophila and Staphylococcus aureus in one patient each. Evidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found in 18 patients and of Chlamydia psittaci infection in three patients. Influenza virus type A was the cause of infection in 15 patients. One patient had infection with influenza virus type B, one patient with parainfluenza virus type 1, and three patients with respiratory syncytial virus. In 20 patients there was evidence of infection with more than one microorganism. No etiological agent was found in 27 patients. Since Streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant etiological agent penicillin should be drug of first choice in patients with pneumonia who need treatment in hospital. In young adults, however, the high frequency of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection would justify the use of erythromycin or doxycycline as drug of first choice.
TI  - [Distribution and changes in the susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. II].
AB  - In vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as ABPC, SBPC, MPC, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CMX, CZX, LMOX, CPZ, CFS and GM against major clinical isolates, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, was examined. In this paper, we will report the susceptibility of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. CEZ- and GM-resistant S. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. CMZ and CFS have showed potent activity against CEZ-resistant S. aureus. It seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant S. aureus. The penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of S. pyogenes could not be found in our study. Quite a few strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. Some strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to CPZ, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to GM.
TI  - Deposition of C3b and iC3b onto particulate activators of the human complement system. Quantitation with monoclonal antibodies to human C3.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the number and molecular form of C3  bound to particulate activators of the complement (C) system by human serum. Sheep erythrocytes (E) coated with IgM (EIgM) and IgG (EIgG) were used to study activation of the classical pathway (CP). Yeast (Y), rabbit erythrocytes (ER), and five species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Hemophilus influenzae type b) were used to study activation of the alternative pathway (AP). The deposition of C3b onto EIgM and EIgG incubated in C7-deficient human serum was dependent on the serum concentration. At all serum concentrations tested, there was complete conversion of C3b to iC3b. Kinetic analysis of C3b deposition and conversion to iC3b indicated that these events occurred almost simultaneously; the reaction was completed by 15 min. The deposition of C3 onto the AP activators ER and Y was also dependent on serum concentration, and ER, but not Y, required the presence of Mg-EGTA and thus the activation of only the AP. C3b deposition and conversion to iC3b on Y was complete in 15 min, with 82% of bound C3 converted to iC3b. For ER, maximum C3 deposition required 30 min in both the presence and absence of Mg-EGTA. However, after 1 h of incubation, 74% of bound C2 was iC3b in the absence of Mg-EGTA, compared with only 52% in the presence of Mg-EGTA. Thus, even on AP activators, a large portion of C3b may be converted to iC3b, and this conversion is probably controlled by elements on the particle's surface. Studies with the five species of bacteria yielded similar results. Approximately 3-5 X 10(4) molecules of C3 were bound per microorganism, with opsonization being completed in 30 min. Remarkably, only 16-28% of bound C3 was in the form of iC3b, even after 2 h of incubation. The presence or absence of Mg-EGTA, or the addition of purified CR1 to the reaction mixture, did not significantly effect the ratio of C3b to iC3b. Finally, SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of particle-bound 125I-C3 fragments confirmed that there was no conversion of iC3b to C3d,g or C3d. The data obtained about the opsonization of bacteria suggest that the predominant form of C3 that is encountered by inflammatory phagocytes may be C3b.
TI  - Clinical value of paired sputum and transtracheal aspirates in the initial management of pneumonia.
AB  - One hundred young adults with acute pneumonia were prospectively studied to determine the impact of the transtracheal aspiration (TTA) Gram stain on immediate management. Sputum and TTA interpretations by staff and housestaff were compared. After a management plan was elected based on sputum Gram stain interpretation, the TTA was evaluated and the final plan chosen. A change in treatment after the TTA was available occurred in eight cases, and this was an appropriate change in only five. The putative pathogen as identified by TTA culture was correctly predicted after sputum Gram stain interpretation in 36 to 62 percent of cases and after TTA interpretation in 37 to 62 percent. This indicates significant observer variation but not superiority of one type of specimen over the other. In most cases, paired sputum and TTA Gram stain were both read correctly or incorrectly. When differences occurred, sputum interpretations were as likely to be correct as were TTA interpretations. The TTA Gram stain offered no advantage over sputum Gram stain in the initial management of acute pneumonia in this young adult military population.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefminox in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - A new antibiotic of cephamycin group, cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) was studied both fundamentally and clinically in the field of pediatrics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of CMNX for clinical isolates including 24 strains of S. aureus, 15 strains of S. pyogenes, 21 strains of H. influenzae, 24 strains of E. coli, 22 strains of K. pneumoniae and 22 strains of P. mirabilis were determined and compared to those of cefmetazole (CMZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). The MIC80 (80% MIC) values of CMNX for H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were 1.56, 1.56, 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. When compared to antibacterial activities of the control drugs, the activity of CMNX was inferior to those of CTX and LMOX but superior to those of CMZ and CEZ. On the other hand, MIC80 values of CMNX for S. pyogenes and S. aureus were 6.25 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, the activities being inferior to all of CMZ, CTX, LMOX, CPZ and CEZ used as the control drugs. In 3 pediatric patients of 9 to 12 years old, 20 mg/kg of CMNX was given intravenously as one shot and serum and urinary concentrations were determined. The mean serum concentrations in these 3 cases were 124 micrograms/ml, 102 micrograms/ml, 74.0 micrograms/ml, 47.9 micrograms/ml, 20.4 micrograms/ml, 9.2 micrograms/ml and 4.3 micrograms/ml at 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours, respectively, with a half-life of 1.83 hours. The mean urinary concentrations were 1,968 micrograms/ml at 0 approximately 2 hours, 1,205 micrograms/ml at 2 approximately 4 hours, 761 micrograms/ml at 4 approximately 6 hours and 409 micrograms/ml at 6 approximately 8 hours, with 65.4% of the drug dosed recovered from the urine within the first 8 hours on an average. CMNX was used in the treatment of 22 clinical cases including 3 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 3 cases of acute bronchitis, 9 cases of acute pneumonia, 5 cases of acute pyelonephritis and 2 cases of acute enteritis. Clinical results in 20 cases excluded of 2 cases of Mycoplasma pneumonia were rated as excellent in 19 cases and as good in 1 case, with an efficacy rate being 100% taking excellent and good cases as effective cases. Bacteriological results for 5 strains of H. influenzae, 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae, 5 strains of E. coli, 2 strains of K. oxytoca and 1 strain of S. pneumoniae revealed that disappearance was obtained for all strains but 1 strain of P. aeruginosa which persisted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Phagocytosis by human leukocytes, phagosomal pH and degradation of seven species  of bacteria measured by flow cytometry.
AB  - Phagocytosis by human leukocytes, phagosomal pH and degradation of seven species  of bacteria were studied by a flow cytometric method. The percentage of phagocytosing leukocytes was similar for all bacterial strains examined, but Salmonella typhi and Neisseria meningitidis were more slowly phagocytosed than other bacteria. The phagosomal pH surrounding the different bacterial species 15 min after the start of phagocytosis were: Streptococcus pneumoniae 4.4; N. meningitidis 4.9; Str. pyogenes 5.1; Staphylococcus aureus 5.2; Escherichia coli 5.3; S. typhi 5.4; and Klebsiella pneumoniae 5.7. For longer incubation periods, the phagosomal pH remained nearly constant. Staph. aureus, E. coli and S. typhi were the most readily degraded of the species tested. The proteins of all bacteria were degraded more rapidly than their DNA as determined by measurements of the loss of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-fluorescence and ethidium bromide-fluorescence, respectively. The rate of degradation varied from one bacterial species to another. The degradation of proteins and DNA was maximal for bacteria residing in a phagosomal environment estimated to be between pH 5.2 and 5.4.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - Interaction of gram-positive microorganisms with complement.
AB  
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: in vitro activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was determined for a broad spectrum of 1,234 organisms isolated as part of a multiclinic study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90 percent of strains tested (MIC90) ranged from 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacteriaceae. MIC90S were 0.015 and 0.06 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, respectively, and 4 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. The MIC90 of cefmenoxime for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Hemophilus influenzae was 0.06 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC50 = 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Rhino- and oropharyngeal carriage of Haemophilus sp. in children].
AB  - The occurence of Haemophilus sp. and other potential pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Neisseria meningitidis has been investigated in 79 children from rhino and oropharyngeal material. H. parainfluenzae is only isolated from the oropharynx. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae may be isolated from the rhinopharynx but are associated to signs of infection in the upper respiratory tract. The capsule of H. Influenzae represents a colonization factor of the rhinopharynx from an oropharyngeal carriage. 6.1% of H. influenzae and 28% of H. parainfluenzae isolates were found resistant to penicillin by production of betalactamase.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against gram-positive aerobic organisms grown in the presence of lincomycin.
AB  - The effect of pre-incubating Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Streptococcus pyogenes with subinhibitory concentrations of lincomycin was studied with respect to polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against these organisms. Culturing the above organisms in the presence of lincomycin (1/4 MIC) resulted in a significant enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and bactericidal activity against these organisms.
TI  - Primary peritonitis in previously healthy children.
AB  - In a review of 22 years of clinical experience, we found seven previously healthy children with primary peritonitis. The diagnosis was made at laparotomy in all patients. Their symptoms included diffuse abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Abdominal tenderness was maximal in the right lower quadrant in five children, which led to confusion with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified as the etiologic agent in three patients and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus in one patient. The remaining three patients all had prior antibiotic therapy, and peritoneal fluid cultures were sterile. All children had a prompt response to treatment with antibiotics and recovered without complications. Long-term follow-up (4 1/2 to 15 years) was available for three patients; all three remained healthy.
TI  - Exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  - The practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) for the selective isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and group D enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of SXT at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. For group D enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to the thymidine concentration. In contrast, the four viridans species studied (Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis II) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. For selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.
TI  - Comparison of latex agglutination and immunofluorescence for direct Lancefield grouping of streptococci from blood cultures.
AB  - Simulated positive blood cultures with 84 known stock strains of streptococci were used to comparatively evaluate the direct identification of these organisms by fluorescein-tagged antibody staining (immunofluorescence [IF]) and latex agglutination (LA). IF was not evaluated for Lancefield group D strains (a total of 81 strains tested) and had 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. IF was least sensitive for the identification of Lancefield group F, in which three of seven strains showed no fluorescence with the group F reagent. Since LA was more convenient and revealed comparable sensitivities and specificities on 84 simulated cultures, we tested this procedure using an additional 29 fresh positive clinical blood cultures, for a total of 113 cultures tested by this technique. Of 11 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 9 reacted with the LA group C reagent, a problem not observed with IF. However, all these strains were identified by a rapid modified bile solubility test. Of the 12 Streptococcus faecalis strains, 4 were falsely negative with the group D reagent, but all were correctly identified by a rapid litmus milk reduction test. Of 12 group A strains, 1 was not detected. Of all 113 strains tested by LA, eliminating S. faecalis and S. pneumoniae, the sensitivity and specificity were 97 and 98%, respectively. LA was simple and reliable in the rapid identification of streptococci from blood cultures and appeared to be preferable to IF. When LA is used, the group D reagent should not be used, and all samples reacting with the group C reagent should be tested by a modified rapid bile solubility test to exclude S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card.
AB  - Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - An extended model for transfer of micro-organisms via the hands: differences between organisms and the effect of alcohol disinfection.
AB  - A model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. The ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. There were differences between the species. Staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes and Serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. These results were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of Escherichia coli and one of Streptococcus pyogenes. The contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. An alcohol handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. Raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1983].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 3,286 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1983 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MIC less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 75, 93, 70 and 96% of the strains tested, while those to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX and LMOX for 89, 65, 61, 86 and 62%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 60%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX and LMOX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ accounted for 95, 95, 80 and 90%, respectively, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml for 79%. S. pneumoniae: At MICs less than 3 micrograms/ml, all strains were susceptible to all cephem antibiotics tested. S. faecalis: Only a very few strains were susceptible to these antibiotics. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus spp.: Susceptible strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 80 and 81% of the strains tested, while those of indole negative and positive Proteus for 69 and 4%, respectively. Strains of E. coli susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml were 78 to 96%, while those to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX and LMOX were 94 to 100%. Those of K. pneumoniae to these 2 groups of antibiotics were 81 to 95% and 94 to 100%, respectively. Susceptible strains of indole negative Proteus to the former group were 81 to 93% and those to the latter were 100%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteriology and treatment of purulent nasopharyngitis: a double blind, placebo-controlled evaluation.
AB  - One hundred forty-two children with purulent nasopharyngitis were randomized to four treatment groups with an antibiotic (cephalexin) alone or combined with a decongestant/antihistamine (pseudoephedrine/triprolidine) or their corresponding placebo equivalents. Follow-up evaluations by parents and physicians and bacteriologic evaluations were performed after 5 to 6 days of therapy. Groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, race, number of patients withdrawn from the study, fever greater than 38.0 degrees C, appearance of nasal discharge, nasal crusting and number of days until follow-up. Initial cultures from patients grew: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 46%; Haemophilus influenzae type b, 21%; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 8%. Nasal crusting was significantly associated with the growth of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae type b. There were no significant differences between active drug and placebo treatment groups for change in nasal discharge, complications or apparent drug benefit. Cephalexin therapy did not result in a decrease in cultivation of pathogenic organisms from the nasopharynx. Significantly more side effects were attributed to pseudoephedrine/triprolidine treatment than to placebo. Routine culture or treatment of purulent nasopharyngitis should not be considered unless future controlled clinical trials demonstrate some therapeutic benefit.
TI  - Twice daily ceftriaxone therapy for serious bacterial infections in children.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone, a long half-life cephalosporin were evaluated in 48 children with a variety of serious bacterial infections. Clinical cure was achieved in 92% (44 of 48) of patients. Peak serum bactericidal titres for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes and Escherichia coli were greater than or equal to 1:1024. Mean peak and trough ceftriaxone levels were 173 and 42 mg/l, respectively. Mild and transient diarrhoea was observed in 10% of patients. Laboratory side effects encountered were eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and neutropenia in another 8%. Ceftriaxone is a useful antibiotic for common childhood infections. Its prolonged half-life allows twice daily administration which reduces problems related to intravenous therapy as well as the cost and personnel time.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - A-16686, a new antibiotic from Actinoplanes. II. Biological properties.
AB  - A-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic obtained from fermentation of an Actinoplanes strain, is active against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; MIC values ranged from 0.016 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. A-16686 is bactericidal for growing cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. mutans, S. mitis and S. sanguis. There is no cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics. A-16686, administered subcutaneously, is very effective in experimental S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae septicemias in the mouse.
TI  - Evaluation of cefotaxime in bacterial infections.
AB  - Cefotaxime, a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated in 26 infants and children for the treatment of documented or suspected bacterial infections, including pneumonia (10 cases), soft tissue skin infection (13 cases), and urinary tract infection (3 cases). An average daily dose of 60 mg/kg in 3 to 4 divided doses was administered parenterally for an average of 7 days. In 14 of the cases, primary pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae b (resistant to ampicillin), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, were eradicated. Clinical recovery occurred in each case. Blood levels at different time intervals and biological half-life were similar to those reported for adults. Mild and transient side effects observed were elevation of SGOT in two cases, alkaline phosphatase in one, and eosinophilia in one case.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  - The preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. The most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, U-57,930E), in which the (2S-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2S-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. This structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. Although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Plasmodium berghei. Pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. It readily penetrates B. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses. A drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. Urinary excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. Pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.
TI  - Acute epiglottitis in adults.
AB  - We treated four adults whose upper airway was compromised due to acute epiglottitis. We also reviewed the English literature for all reports of this condition in adults (18 years and older). Among the 158 cases, the infectious etiology was identified in 29 (H. influenzae 20, Streptococcus pneumoniae six, H. parainfluenzae two, Streptococcus pyogenes one). In the remaining cases, the etiology was uncertain. Bacteremia was documented in 23/32 patients (71.9%), but extra-epiglottic infections were strikingly rare (X = six). The clinical manifestations were sore throat (100%), fever (88%), dyspnea (78%), dysphagia (76%), anterior neck cellulitis or tenderness (27%), hoarseness (21%), pharyngitis (20%) and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (9%). Complete airway obstruction ensued in 23 out of the 119 subjects (18.3%) who had respiratory difficulty. Overall mortality rate was 17.6% but it was 6.4% among the patients who were semi-electively tracheostomized or endotracheally intubated. These findings illustrate that antibiotics therapy active against H. influenzae is required in the treatment of acute epiglottitis in adults. Additionally, airway patency should be established when inspiratory stridor appears assuring uncomplicated recovery.
TI  - Bacterial sinusitis.
AB  - Sinusitis may occur secondary to infectious agents, allergens, or pollutants. Bacteriologic studies carried out from sinus punctures revealed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are the most common bacterial pathogens isolated. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are not uncommon pathogens. Complications of sinusitis, including orbital cellulitis, usually are due to infection with Staphylococcus aureus and H influenzae. The recent increase in certain areas of the country of beta-lactamase-producing strains of H influenzae is noted. When the etiology remains to be determined in the patient with acute bacterial sinusitis, initial therapy with an oral cephalosporin seems warranted.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci.
AB  
TI  - Activity of common antibiotics against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus in 1983.
AB  - The activity of phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV), ampicillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  chloramphenicol, co trimoxazole, doxycycline and erythromycin against clinical isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus in 1983 was investigated with the MIC-method (plate-dilution technique). Forty-six percent of B. catarrhalis, 2% of H. influenzae and 78% of S. aureus were beta-lactamase producing and had high MIC-values for penicillin and ampicillin. Thus MIC for 90% of all strains of B. catarrhalis was 32 mg/l and 8 mg/l for penicillin and ampicillin while MIC for 90% of non beta-lactamase producing Branhamella strains was 2 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l respectively. This indicates a high susceptibility of penicillins to the action of Branhamella beta-lactamase. Almost all strains of B. catarrhalis, pneumococci, group A streptococci and S. aureus were inhibited at low concentrations of erythromycin. However, 4 mg/l was required to inhibit 90% of H. influenzae. Co-trimoxazole and doxycycline had good activity against all B. catarrhalis and H. influenzae strains while a few pneumococci, streptococci and staphylococci had intermediate sensitivity or were resistant. Essentially all strains were sensitive to cefuroxime and chloramphenicol.
TI  - Induction of human gamma interferon by structurally defined polypeptide fragments of group A streptococcal M protein.
AB  - The presence of interferon (IFN) has been demonstrated previously (i) in fluids obtained from the middle ears of children with Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, (ii) from the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with either S. pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes, and (iii) from human lymphoid cell cultures treated with a variety of bacteria. In this study, we showed that highly purified peptic extracts of three different serotypes of group A streptococcal M protein (pep M5, pep M6, and pep M24) stimulated human peripheral leukocytes to produce IFN. IFN production was apparent by 10 h and peaked 24 h after exposure. Dose-response experiments indicated that IFN could be detected in cultures treated with concentrations of M protein as low as 6 micrograms/ml, whereas maximum IFN production occurred at a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml. The IFN had antigenic and physicochemical characteristics of IFN-gamma. Preliminary leukocyte fractionation studies revealed that the IFN-producing cell was a nonadherent lymphocyte with receptors for sheep erythrocytes (T cell). Rabbit antisera specific for these structurally defined polypeptide fragments of streptococcal M protein (pep M5, pep M6, and pep M24) blocked IFN induction by each of the polypeptides. The data suggest that the different serotypes of streptococcal M protein may induce IFN by a common structural determinant shared by each of the polypeptide fragments tested.
TI  - Antibiotic treatment of secretory otitis media.
AB  - There is increasing evidence for an infectious etiology of secretory otitis media (SOM). Respiratory pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis and group A streptococci) have been found in cases of long-standing SOM, with a frequency of 18% in the middle ear and 79% in the nasopharynx. Erythromycin has been shown to penetrate into the middle ear effusion of SOM and into adenoid tissue. The concentrations surpassed the MIC's of most respiratory pathogens, with the exception of certain strains of H. influenzae. In agreement with this, a ten day course of erythromycin in children with SOM eradicated practically all nasopharyngeal strains of S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis, while there was no significant decrease in the number of strains of H. influenzae. The present study consisted of 119 children with SOM lasting three months or more. One group of 47 consecutive children was treated with erythromycin (Abboticin), given orally twice a day, in a dose of 40-60 mg/kg/24 hours, for ten days. The rate of resolution in this test group was 45% (21/47 cases). Another group of 72 consecutive children with SOM of a similar duration received no antibiotics. The cure rate in this control group was 15% (11/72 cases). The difference between the two groups is statistically significant (chi 2 = 11054; df = 1; p less than 0.001). The results suggest that a ten day course of erythromycin could reduce the need for surgical treatment in children with long-standing SOM.
TI  - Secretory otitis media: microbiology of the middle ear and the nasopharynx.
AB  - Specimens for bacterial culture were obtained from 117 children with secretory otitis media (SOM). From the nasopharynx Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and group A streptococci were isolated in 79% of the patients. Of 168 ear exudates, 30 yielded growth (18%) from 26 of the patients (22%). Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides could not be detected in exudates assayed by counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The recovery rate of bacteria from the ear exudates was significantly higher in patients with positive than with negative nasopharyngeal culture (p less than 0.05). The nasopharyngeal pathogens invading the middle ear in SOM seem to survive there for a period of time and are then replaced by other strains according to the fluctuation of the nasopharyngeal flora where approximately 40% of the strains were eliminated and replaced by other strains over a period of 12 to 13 days.
TI  - Isolation of pathogenic bacteria from the nasopharynx of children with respiratory syncytial virus infection. Predictive value of chest roentgen examination and laboratory tests.
AB  - Potentially pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the nasopharynx in 33/66 hospitalized infants and children with verified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The value of chest roentgenograms and blood counts for the prediction of concomitant bacterial infection was evaluated. Abnormal chest roentgenograms were found in 89% whether pathogenic bacteria were present or not. The most common finding was general hyperinflation of the lungs, with or without infiltrates. This occurred more frequently in the group with isolated RSV infection. Fever, leucocytosis and an elevated ESR were found during the illness in more than half the cases. These findings were more frequent in children who harboured potential pathogenic bacteria, though the difference was not significant. For optimal evaluation of a case all available information about it should be taken into consideration.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of MDL 19,592, an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - MDL 19,592 is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a good therapeutic potential against Gram-positive bacterial infections when administered orally or parenterally. In the oral treatment of benzylpenicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice, MDL 19,592 was superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefaclor, cefadroxil and cefroxadine. These in vivo results reflect the in vitro superiority expressed by MDL 19,592 over the other oral cephalosporins against staphylococci. Additionally, MDL 19,592 orally was superior to cefazolin and cephalothin administered subcutaneously and to a number of penicillinase-resistant penicillins given orally or subcutaneously in the treatment of S. aureus mouse infections. MDL 19,592 killed S. aureus cells at the same or faster rate than did cephalexin or cephradine. As compared to cephalexin, MDL 19,592 was marginally superior in vitro against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In vivo, MDL 19,592 was significantly the more effective of the two against S. pyogenes and marginally more effective against S. pneumoniae. Against Gram-negative organisms, with the exception of Haemophilus influenzae, cephalexin was the more potent of the two antibiotics both in vitro and in vivo. Administered orally to mice, MDL 19,592 was absorbed as rapidly as cephalexin with both drugs attaining similar concentrations in the blood. MDL 19,592, like cephalexin, was minimally bound by mouse serum.
TI  - Identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). PBPs with similar properties are carried by strains of Streptococcus durans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The strains carrying the slow-reacting PBP demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. Spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from S. faecium ATCC 9790. They all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting PBP produced. Mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of S. durans, S. faecalis, and S. faecium. All of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting PBP than that carried by the parent. Finally, it was found that resistant S. faecium ATCC 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all PBPs except PBP 5. Cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting PBP by 90%. This penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - [Pharmacological evaluation of an ampicillin suppository (KS-R1) in acute pneumonia in children--a comparison with a parenteral preparation of ampicillin].
AB  - A comparative well-controlled study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of KS-R1 (ampicillin (ABPC) rectal suppository) compared with those of intravenous injection of ABPC against acute bacterial pneumonia caused by ABPC-sensitive bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in pediatric field. KS-R1 at the dose of 250 mg X 4/day of ABPC in potency, or the intravenous injection at the dose of 125 mg X 4/day of ABPC in potency, was given to 68 cases of patients with bacterial pneumonia, aged between 10 months and 8 years and 2 months, for 7 days, as a rule. The clinical efficacy rates evaluated in 61 cases (KS-R1 group in 31 cases, intravenous group in 30 cases) on standard criteria of committee members were 93.5% for the KS-R1 group and 83.3% for the intravenous group, respectively. There was no significant difference between 2 groups. Evaluation by stratification according to the age showed that KS-R1 was significantly superior, the rate being 90.5% among the children from 1 year to 3 years in the KS-R1 group and 61.5% in the intravenous group. The bacteriological effect was evaluated in 16 cases (KS-R1 group in 7 cases, intravenous group in 9 cases), the disappearance rate was 100% for the KS-R1 group and 88.9% for the intravenous group, without significant difference. With regard to side effects, 66 cases (KS-R1 group in 35 cases, intravenous group in 31 cases) were strictly evaluated in relation to subjective and objective symptoms. As a result, no significant difference was noted between 2 groups in the incidence rate which was 17.1% for the KS-R1 group and 9.7% for the intravenous group. The above results indicate that against acute bacterial pneumonia in pediatric field, the KS-R1 at the dose of 250 mg X 4/day of ABPC in potency possesses clinical efficacy and safety similar to the intravenous injection at the dose of 125 mg X 4/day of ABPC in potency, and that it is a useful suppository.
TI  - [Pharmacological evaluation of an ampicillin suppository (KS-R1) in acute respiratory tract infection in children: a comparison with an oral form of ampicillin].
AB  - A comparative well-controlled study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ampicillin rectal suppository (KS-R1) compared with those of oral form of ampicillin (ABPC) against acute respiratory tract infections in pediatric field. KS-R1 at the dose of 125 mg X 4/day of ABPC in potency, or the oral form at the same dosage, was given to 166 cases of patients with acute respiratory tract infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae for 7 days, as a rule. The clinical efficacy rates evaluated in 151 cases (KS-R1 group in 77 cases, oral group in 74 cases) on standard criteria of committee members were 88.3% for the KS-R1 group and 86.5% for the oral group, respectively. There was no significant difference between 2 groups. Evaluation by stratification according to the diagnosis showed that the efficacy rates for the KS-R1 group and for the oral group were 87.5% and 85.0% against pharyngitis, 90.5% and 90.0% against tonsillitis and 84.2% and 78.6% against bronchitis, respectively. None of them showed significant difference between 2 groups. The bacteriological effect was evaluated in 55 cases (KS-R1 group in 33 cases, oral group in 22 cases), and disappearance rate was 93.9% for the KS-R1 group and 95.5% for the oral group, showing no significant difference. Side effect including subjective and objective symptoms were strictly evaluated in 163 cases (KS-R1 group in 83 cases, oral group in 80 cases), but the incidence rate which was 22.9% for the KS-R1 group and 23.8% for the oral group showed no significant difference. The above results indicate that against acute respiratory tract infections in pediatric field, KS-R1 possesses clinical efficacy and safety similar to the oral form of ABPC, and that it is a useful suppository.
TI  - Mastoid subperiosteal abscess.
AB  - Subperiosteal abscess was the indication for surgery in every child with acute mastoiditis who underwent mastoidectomy at our institution since 1972. Nineteen such patients are discussed herein. Positive bacteriologic findings included Streptococcus pyogenes in three patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in three patients, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in two patients, and enterococcus in the one patient with cholesteatoma. Cultures were more often positive for causative bacteria when taken directly from the abscess before or shortly after beginning antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Parapneumonic pleural effusion and empyema in children. Review of a 19-year experience, 1962-1980.
AB  - Between 1962 and 1980, 50 children admitted to Strong Memorial Hospital had a pleural effusion or an empyema associated with pneumonia. Such parapneumonic effusion and empyema accounted for 52 per cent of cases of pleural effusion and empyema of all etiologies admitted during those years. Review of cases of parapneumonic effusion and empyema suggested that clinical manifestations, laboratory, and roentgenographic findings did not separate these two groups of patients before thoracentesis was performed. Specific organisms were identified in 29 per cent of cases with parapneumonic effusion and 62 per cent with parapneumonic empyema. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were responsible for 35, 30, and 20 per cent of cases, respectively. Parapneumonic effusions were treated without closed-chest tube drainage in 76 per cent of the cases, while closed-chest drainage was necessary in virtually all cases of children with empyema.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new injectable cephamycin antibiotic, was studied for its antibacterial activity, concentration in serum and urine, penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as clinical application. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activity: The susceptibilities of clinically isolated K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae to T-1982 were superior to those of CEZ CMZ, and ABPC. T-1982 seemed to be useful for various infections due to Gram-negative rods. 2. Concentration in serum and urine: Subjects were 10 children with congenital heart failure but no abnormal renal and liver functions. T-1982 was given intravenously to 3 groups at 200 mg/kg by one shot (4 cases), 20 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases) and 10 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases). The half-lives were 60, 78 and 85 minutes, respectively. 3. Penetration into cerebrospinal fluid: Three children with malignant tumor were injected 20 mg/kg intravenously. A small amount of T-1982 was penetrated into CSF. 4. Clinical efficacy: T-1982 was administered daily 40-116 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 2-14 days to 17 children comprising 1 bronchopneumonia, 1 bronchitis, 4 tonsillitis, 1 lymphadenitis, 1 sepsis, 1 pharyngitis, 1 impetigo, 1 acute sinusitis and 6 pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 10, good in 2, fair and poor in 3, and the efficacy rate was 70.6%. Bacteriological effect was as follows; eradicated in 9 cases and unknown in 8 cases. As side effect, GOT and GPT elevations unrelated to the drug were observed in 2 cases. Other abnormal findings were not found. T-1982 seems to be safe antibiotic in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperzone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out  in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. Peak MIC of T-1982 against S. pyogenes (group A) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. Peak MICs of T-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against B. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against K. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. Serum levels and urinary excretions of T-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. When given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of T-1982 attained the peak level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (T 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. Approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form into urine within 6 hours. 4. Twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with T-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by Serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant E. coli. The efficacy rate was 96.3%. In this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes) and Gram-negative rods (H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae P. vulgaris, B. pertussis, S. marcescens, E. coli) were eradicated by the treatment with T-1982. 6. No noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of GOT in 1 case.

TI  - [In vitro activity of josamycin in a comparison of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  - The antibacterial effect of josamycin has been tested in vitro on strains of S. Aureus, Str. Pyogenes and Str. Pneumoniae isolated during 1981 from human liquor, blood and purulent secretions. It is confirmed that even modest doses of the antibiotic have this effect upon S. Aureus strains which are resistant to several antibiotics including erythromycin and lincomycin. In some cases, although bacteriostasis occurred, bacterial survival indices were fairly modest.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute otitis media in Japanese children.
AB  - Bacteriologic investigations were performed on 100 children with acute otitis media by culturing the fluid from a myringotomy site. Patients ranged in age from 7 months to 14 years, and 91 were younger than 6 years old. Bacterial isolates were yielded from cultures in 83 cases, and mixtures of two or three organisms were obtained from 15 patients. Among the total of 100 isolates, the most predominant organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (28), followed by Hemophilus influenzae (26), Staphylococcus aureus (19), and Streptococcus pyogenes (six). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin sodium against S pneumoniae and H influenzae were 0.016 to 0.032 and 0.25 to 0.5 mg/L, respectively. None of the strains of H influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. The MICs of dicloxacillin sodium, cephalexin monohydrate, cefaclor, and erythromycin to H influenzae were 8 to 32, 8 to 16, 2 to 8, and 2 to 8 mg/L, respectively. The preferred drug for acute otitis media would be ampicillin in Japan, but we have to consider antistaphylococcal antibiotics for the patients who do not respond to 48 hours of treatment.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of new cephem antibiotics against clinical isolates.  A comparison of the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime with 6 other antibiotics].
AB  - During the period from May through July 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftizoxime (CZX), cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). CTX and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. The clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order: urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. Concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. This was followed by E. coli and E. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and C. freundii and E. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. In relation to S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, CTX showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was CZX. CMZ and LMOX were found to show relatively high MIC values for those species. Against S. aureus, CEZ showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. With regard to Gram-negative bacteria, CTX and CZX showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for P. aeruginosa. These were followed, in order, by LMOX and CPZ. Compared with these 4 antibiotics, CTM, CMZ and CEZ were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. In relation to P. aeruginosa, the peak of the MIC distribution for CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. This was followed by CTX (25 micrograms/ml) LMOX (25 micrograms/ml) and CZX (50 micrograms/ml). CTM had an MIC of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of P. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. All of the strains were resistant to CMZ and CEZ, showing MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. For each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the MIC and the serogroup for either P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens.
TI  - General principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - The initial treatment of suspected life-threatening bacterial infection should be sufficiently broad to cover the likely causative agents. Definitive therapy depends on microbial isolation, identification, and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. Parenteral therapy should be used, at least initially, and optimal doses are necessary. The dose is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered; a concern for potential side effects with use of these agents had engendered a tendency to administer inadequate doses. The problems leading to recurrence or persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. Combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group D streptococci, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Laboratory assistance for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be valuable but is not always necessary because certain microorganisms--for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes--have stable, predictable susceptibilities. Cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from upper respiratory tract infections in Sweden.
AB  - Isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Branhamella catarrhalis were collected from five laboratories in different geographical areas in Sweden. Nine hundred and fortyfour strains were tested by the agar dilution method for susceptibility to seven oral antibiotics: phenoximethylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefaclor, erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. The H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis strains were also tested for beta-lactamase production. Of the H. influenzae strains, 8% were beta-lactamase-producing, while 35% of B. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. The latter value is higher than has earlier been reported in Sweden. Five S. pneumoniae strains showed decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and 9.5% of the S. pneumoniae strains showed a decreased sensitivity to one or more of the seven antibiotics tested. The S. pyogenes strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested with the exception of 4% of the strains, which showed a decreased sensitivity to doxycycline.
TI  - Clinical trial of bacampicillin in acute bacterial infections.
AB  - A clinical trial of bacampicillin was carried out in 20 patients. The antibiotic  was found to be effective in acute lobar pneumonia, pyogenic meningitis, acute and chronic bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, cellulitis, furunculosis, and pyomyositis caused by such ampicillin-sensitive organisms as Neisseria meningitidis, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Rash in three patients was the only side effect encountered. It is concluded that while bacampicillin may have overcome some of the disadvantages of ampicillin, it retains its main attributes and some shortcomings.
TI  - Serum and saliva concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in adults and children: relation between saliva concentrations and in vitro activity against nasopharyngeal pathogens.
AB  - The combination sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) was given orally to 4 healthy adult volunteers in mean daily doses of 23.0/4.6 mg/kg body weight for 6 days. The serum and saliva concentrations of the drugs were assayed on days 1, 3 and 6. On the first day (0-12 h) there was no measurable concentration of SMX in the saliva. On days 3 and 6 the mean peak levels of SMX in saliva were 7.8 and 9.8 micrograms/ml, i.e. 8-9% of the corresponding mean peak serum levels. In contrast, the concentrations of TMP in saliva were more than twice as high as those in serum. The mean SMX/TMP ratios in saliva days 3 and 6 were 1.3 and 1.4, respectively, i.e. approximately one-twentieth of the mean SMX/TMP ratios in serum. SMX/TMP was also administered to children with serous otitis media. The drug concentrations in saliva were assayed 2-3 h after administration on days 6 and 9 of a 10-day course, with a mean daily dose of 34.5/6.9 mg/kg body weight. The mean saliva concentration of SMX in the children was slightly higher than in adults and the mean TMP concentration about half of that in adults. The mean SMX/TMP ratio in the children's saliva was 4.2. The in vitro activity of SMX/TMP 20:1 and 4:1 was determined against H. influenzae, D. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis and group A streptococci. H. influenzae, D. pneumoniae and group A streptococci were found more susceptible to TMP than to SMX, while the reverse was true for B. catarrhalis. In the 3 former, the potentiation of SMX by TMP was more pronounced than was the potentiation of TMP by SMX, while the opposite was recorded for B. catarrhalis. The most beneficial effect of the SMX/TMP combination against nasopharyngeal pathogens was recorded for B. catarrhalis and the weakest effect for H. influenzae and group A streptococci. With the exception of B. catarrhalis, the administration of TMP alone to adults may be just as effective against nasopharyngeal pathogens as is the SMX/TMP combination in children.
TI  - A controlled trial of cefaclor versus amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in early infancy.
AB  - Optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. We studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double blind comparative trial. Infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. Clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. Pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included Streptococcus pneumoniae (14), Haemophilus influenzae type b (5), H. influenzae nontypeable (3), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Branhamella sp. (2), and Streptococcus pyogenes (1). Nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included Streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and Streptococcus viridans. Two aspirates were sterile. A satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of 19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. We conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.
TI  - Detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  - Intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. Because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. Alveolar lining material from rats caused rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. The antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. Phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. Lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. The surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated methyl-D-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. Bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Bacillus species. Purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Circulating immune complexes in inflammatory lung diseases and their relation to infectious factors].
AB  - The results obtained in the study of the intensity and duration of the circulation of immune complexes in the peripheral blood in 59 patients with acute pneumonia and in 120 patients with chronic bronchitis, as well as the reaction of these complexes to etiologically important bacterial antigens (pneumococcal, staphylococcal, type b Haemophilus influenzae, streptococcal), are presented.
TI  - Clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. The first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. A total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. Overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. In the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. The efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (P = 0.03). Favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to Proteus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species. Cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. All Serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for Pseudomonas isolates was wide.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. Both compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus and Providencia; the great majority of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. All Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. The isolates belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). There were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. Both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.
TI  - [Immunological reactivity to the products of normal microflora. IV. Antibodies to common species-specific pneumococcal antigens in the human spectrum of antibacterial antibodies].
AB  - Normal human serum antibodies to the protein complex more than 20 common (species-specific) STr. Pneumoniae antigens have been studied. In commercial lots of gamma globulin, manufactured during the last 8 years, antibodies to 9 pneumococcal antigens have been detected. The spectrum of antibodies and the intensity of reactions Str. pneumoniae has been found to be not inferior to Str. aureus and pyogenes (group A) and to considerably exceed Str. faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, St. epidermidis, Str. salivarius, Str. viridans, N. perflava, Ps. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, B. bifidum.
TI  - Group A streptococcal empyema complicating Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
AB  
TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - Penetration of amoxicillin, cefaclor, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole into the middle ear fluid of patients with chronic serous otitis media.
AB  - Penetration into the middle ear of four antibiotics commonly used in treatment of otitis media was studied by administering a single oral dose of amoxicillin, cefaclor, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to 83 children with chronic serous otitis media. The antibiotic was given 15-240 min before the removal of middle ear fluid (MEF) by ventilation tubes inserted through the tympanic membrane. At the time MEF was obtained, a sample of blood was drawn from the patient, and concentrations of antibiotic in both specimens were assayed either microbiologically by a disk diffusion method or by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Amoxicillin had the highest ratio of mean peak concentration in MEF to minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the three most common pathogens of otitis media (Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-sensitive Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes), whereas trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had the highest ratio of mean peak concentration in MEF to MIC for ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive cocci was studied by microdilution broth susceptibility tests and compared with the activities of clindamycin, vancomycin, oxacillin, and ampicillin. U-57930E inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus viridans at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. This degree of activity was generally slightly less than that of the other antimicrobial agents tested. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci were resistant to U-57930E. At the concentrations used, U-57930E exhibited bactericidal activity against most susceptible organisms, and a minimal effect of inoculum size was noted.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - Cefuroxime therapy for pneumonia in infants and children.
AB  - Because Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae b and Staphylococcus aureus are the major causes of bacterial pneumonia in infancy, we customarily have given a beta-lactam antibiotic and chloramphenicol as initial antibiotic therapy. Cefuroxime (75 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours iv or im) was evaluated as single drug therapy in an open study of 100 infants and children with suspected bacterial pneumonia. The mean serum concentration of cefuroxime 30 minutes after a 15-minute infusion of 25 mg/kg iv was 29.1 micrograms/ml, and the volume of distribution was 695 ml/kg. Pleural fluid concentrations in 3 specimens were 2.2, 8.5 and 11 micrograms/ml. Median age of patients was 15 months. Bacterial etiology was established in 20 patients: H. influenzae b (8 patients); pneumococcus (8 patients); S. aureus (2 patients); Group A streptococcus (1 patient); Neisseria meningitidis B (1 patient). All organisms were susceptible to 1.25-micrograms/ml doses or less of cefuroxime. The mean number of days was 3.1 until patients became afebrile and 5.1 until respiratory symptoms were gone. Eosinophilia occurred in 10 patients. Cefuroxime is safe and effective single drug therapy for pneumonia in infants and children.
TI  - Blood culture cross contamination associated with a radiometric analyzer.
AB  - During a 9-day period in August 1980 in a New Jersey hospital, three pairs of consecutively numbered blood cultures from different patients were identified as positive for the same organism (two pairs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one pair of group A Streptococcus), for each pair, both cultures were positive in the same atmosphere, both organisms had the same sensitivities, and the second of each pair grew at least 2 days after the first and was the only positive blood culture obtained from the patient. When the hospital laboratory discontinued use of its radiometric culture analyzer for 15 days, no more consecutive pairs of positive cultures occurred. Subsequent use of the machine for 9 days with a new power unit but the original circuit boards resulted in one more similar consecutive pair (Staphylococcus epidermidis). After replacement of the entire power unit, there were no further such pairs. Examination of the machine by the manufacturer revealed a defective circuit board which resulted in inadequate needle sterilization. Laboratories which utilize radiometric analyzers should be aware of the potential for cross contamination. Recognition of such events requires alert microbiologists and infection control practitioners and a record system in the bacteriology laboratory designed to identify such clusters.
TI  - Membrane stimulation and intracellular killing by monocytes.
AB  - The present paper reviews our recent studies concerning the intracellular killing of bacteria by human monocytes and compares the results with those found for circulating granulocytes. The findings show that optimal intracellular killing of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria is only reached during interaction of the Fc part of IgG and complement component C3b with their specific receptors in the membrane of the phagocytes. Similar stimulation was found during interaction of plant lectins and their specific sugar moieties in the cell membrane. The studies permit the general conclusion that optimal intracellular killing of micro-organisms requires membrane stimulation, which occurs after triggering of certain receptors.
TI  - Swabs and swab-transport media kits in the isolation of upper respiratory bacteria.
AB  - The recovery of upper respiratory tract bacteria on laboratory media from a variety of swabs and swab-transport media kits was examined. Organisms studied included strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. Although a wide range of results was obtained with regard to variables such as the type of swab or swab-transport media kit used, the time of plating, the temperature of storage of swab-transport media kits, and the nature of the suspension of the organisms, it was generally noted that recovery of organisms was better from swabs held in their plastic containers prior to plating than from swabs held in transport medium.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae, Pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus: sensitivity of outpatient strains to commonly prescribed antibiotics.
AB  - The degree of resistance of Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus to phenoxymethylpenicillin, ampicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was investigated with the MIC-method (plate-dilution technique). Each bacterial group consisted of 100 outpatient strains. Seven strains of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase-producing. Of the 100 haemophilus strains, 58% were sensitive and the rest intermediate sensitive to erythromycin. 99% were sensitive to doxycycline and all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Essentially all pneumococcal strains were sensitive to the antibiotics tested. However, a few strains demonstrated diminished sensitivity to penicillins. All group A streptococci were sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin and chloramphenicol, and 98% were sensitive to erythromycin. Approximately 1 strain out of 5 was resistant to doxycycline. 75% of S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Four of the S., aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin and 8 to doxycycline. The results presented indicate a better antibiotic situation than in some other countries, but suggest the need for a more extensive antibiotic sensitivity examination of isolated bacteria.
TI  - Cephradine levels in human aqueous humor.
AB  - In an attempt to investigate penetration of cephradine into the primary aqueous humor in man, we administered 500-mg and 1-g doses of cephradine orally to 27 patients about to undergo elective cataract extraction. A mean peak aqueous humor level of 0.87 microgram/mL was obtained at about three hours after the 500-mg dose. The mean peak aqueous humor level after the 1-g dose also occurred at three hours and was 1.99 microgram/mL, with a range from 0.91 to 3.25 microgram/mL. This concentration was greater than the median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cephradine for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Str pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus (when tested in nutrient agar) but was greater than the MIC for 90% of isolates only with Str pyogenes.
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Measles pneumonia in young adults. An analysis of 106 cases.
AB  - Measles occurred in 3,220 Air Force recruits between January 1976 and July 1979 and was complicated by pneumonia in 106 cases (3.3 percent). Although no deaths occurred, the illness was characterized as clinically severe with high fever and prolonged hospitalization (mean, 14.5 days). Bacterial superinfection as documented by transtracheal aspiration occurred in 35 cases (30.3 percent) and was caused by Hemophilus influenzae (18), Hemophilus parainfluenzae (two), Neisseria meningitidis (nine), Streptococcus pneumoniae (three), Streptococcus pyogenes (two) and Moraxella kingae (one). Clinical evidence of bronchospasm was present in 18 patients (17 percent) and required bronchodilators in six. Other complications included liver function abnormalities (31 percent), otitis media (29 percent) and sinusitis (25 percent). Measles pneumonia in adolescents is clinically severe with a generally benign outcome.
TI  - Participation of immunoglobulins and complement components in the intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by human granulocytes.
AB  - Immunoglobulins and complement components are required for optimal ingestion and  optimal killing of microorganisms by granulocytes. The degree of opsonization of microorganisms necessary for their ingestion was lower than that required for the killing of these bacteria during the ingestion phase. Killing during this phase was found to depend mainly on the presence of heat-labile opsonins, probably C3b, present on the microorganisms. Extracellular immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3b were indispensable for optimal intracellular killing after ingestion was complete. This was established with an assay permitting assessment of the course of the number of viable intracellular bacteria independent of the ingestion of new live bacteria. Maximal intracellular killing by human granulocytes of ingested catalase-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) or catalase-negative (Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae) microorganisms was found only when fresh serum was present extracellularly. Killing was suboptimal in the absence of serum. With heat-inactivated serum, the killing index lay between the indices obtained in the presence and absence of fresh serum. The stimulatory activity of heat-inactivated serum was most probably due to the interaction of IgG with the Fc receptor on the granulocyte membrane, since IgG subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 as well as pFc fragments of IgG stimulated the intracellular killing to the same degree as heat-inactivated serum did. In addition, (Fab1)2 fragments of IgG did not stimulate killing, and reduced killing was observed in the presence of heat-inactivated serum after reduction of the number of Fc receptors. The extra stimulation of the killing process in the presence of fresh serum compared with heat-inactivated serum was due to the interaction between membrane receptors and complement--most probably C3b generated by both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement activation. This conclusion is based on results obtained with sera in which one or both complement pathways were blocked, on the restoration of the killing-stimulatory activity of C3-deficient serum after addition of fresh C3, and on the reduced killing observed in the presence of fresh serum after reduction of the number of C3 receptors by the use of pronase or antigranulocyte serum.
TI  - Peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with LeVeen shunts.
AB  - Six cirrhotic patients are described in whom peritonitis developed from 10 days to 15 months after the insertion of a LeVeen shunt. The presenting clinical features of fever, increasing ascites and deterioration in mental status resembled these previously reported for cirrhotic patients but with spontaneous peritonitis without shunts. Important differences were observed, however, in microbiology, incidence of bacteremia and therapy. Staphylococcus aureus, a rare cause of spontaneous peritonitis, was found in one half of our cases, suggesting that perioperative contamination during shunt placement was an important etiologic factor. All six had concomitant bacteremia which may be attributable to the direct peritoneal-venous connection. Appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy without shunt removal failed to eradicate the infection irrespective of the patency of the shunt or absence of inflammation at the sites of insertion. Recommended treatment for suspected peritonitis in patients with shunts is systemic antimicrobial therapy with an agent active against staphylococci plus an aminoglycoside, followed by removal of the shunt if the diagnosis is confirmed.
TI  - A genetic locus responsible for salmonella susceptibility in BSVS mice is not responsible for the limited T-dependent immune responsiveness of BSVS mice.
AB  - BSVS mice are known to be highly susceptible to salmonella infection. We have shown that the bulk of the difference in susceptibility between BSVS and salmonella-resistant A/J mice is the result of a genetic difference at a single locus not closely linked to H-2, Igh-C, or Hbb, and not X-linked. We have backcrossed the A/J allele at this locus into BSVS mice for 8 successive generations and have demonstrated that the salmonella resistance afforded by this allele is not the result of a restoration of the generalized poor T-dependent responsiveness of BSVS mice. The salmonella resistance locus we have examined with these 2 strains is probably the same as the Ity locus described by others.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity and mode of action of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a new highly potent cephalosporin.
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of DL 473, a new semisynthetic rifamycin derivative.
AB  - DL 473, a new semisynthetic rifamycin, was 2-10 times more active in vitro than rifampicin (RAMP) against several clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and only slightly less active than RAMP against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It showed excellent therapeutic activity in mice in experimental infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the experimental TB infection in the mouse DL 473 was clearly more active than isoniazide and RAMP, two of the most effective antitubercular drugs in current use. The LD50 in the mouse was significantly higher than that of RAMP and the half-life was about 5 times longer than that of RAMP.
TI  - Streptococcal infections in pregnancy. A study of 48 bacteremias.
AB  - During a 4-year period, 48 obstetric patients with aerobic streptococcal bacteremia were identified. The isolates were group B (31); group D, enterococci (5); group A (4); group D, not enterococci (3); Streptococcus pneumoniae (3); and viridans streptococci (2). The most common diagnoses were endometritis (36) and chorioamnionitis (8). For all streptococcal genital infections, the clinical presentation included early-onset fever, often with few localizing signs. Only one patient had a chronic debilitating disease. There was an excellent correlation between genital and bloodstream isolates (36 of 42). Maternal response to therapy was good, with no deaths nor episodes of septic shock. Possible infectious complications developed in two fetuses and four neonates. The microbiologic and clinical features of aerobic streptococci were reviewed, and the outcome in obstetric patients and that in other adults were compared.
TI  - Uveitis, vitreous humour, and klebsiella. II. Cross-reactivity studies with radioimmunoassay.
AB  - Radioimmunoassay with calf and cow vitreous humour-I125 and rabbit antivitreous humour serum has been employed to investigate the immunological cross-reactivity of vitreous humour with bacterial and mammalian tissue antigens. Klebsiella ultrasonicate preparation at a dose fo 10 000 micrograms/ml was found to inhibit the binding of vitreous humour by 25-100% (p less than 0.001), compared with an inhibition of 5-30% by a similar quantity of E. coli ultrasonicate preparation. Equivalent amounts of Streptococcus pyogenes antigen, bovine haemoglobin, and hyaluronic acid had no inhibitory effect, while horse spleen ferritin was found to inhibit vitreous humour binding between 0 and 10%. These results indicate that klebsiella micro-organisms have antigens which partially resemble some eyeball components. It is suggested that acute anterior uveitis of ankylosing spondylitis may be produced by anti-Gram-negative bacterial antibodies binding to cross-reacting eye antigens.
TI  - New method that uses binding of immunoglobulin A to group A streptococcal immunoglobulin A Fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin A protease activity.
AB  - A new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease which splits IgA into Fab and Fc fragments. The method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for IgA fragments occur commonly among type 4 group A streptococci. The bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified IgA1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. Since isolated Fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal IgA receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. Using this method, protease activity was detected in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus sanguis, but not in Escherichia coli or Branhamella catarrhalis.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotiam (CTM) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of CTM by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1), Salmonella typhi (1), and Campylobacter jejuni (1). All but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the CTM therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. Diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with the CTM therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum CTM level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was rapid. CSF concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of CTM in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the CSF/serum ratio was 9.0%. From these data, CTM appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - Uveitis, vitreous humor, and klebsiella. I. Binding studies with rabbit antisera.
AB  - Uveitis occur in a proportion of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, and an increased faecal isolation of the Gram-negative micro-organism Klebsiella pneumoniae has been reported from such patients. Immunological cross-reactivity between K. pneumoniae and bovine vitreous humour has been studied by 2 different antibody binding techniques: I125-labelled antigen binding assay with and without carrier, and beta-galactosidase enzyme-immunoassay. Sera from rabbits immunised with whole klebsiella micro-organisms or klebsiella extracts were found to bind labelled vitreous humour antigens to a greater extent (p less than 0.001) than sera from rabbits immunised with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and phi X 174 virus or sera from the same rabbits before immunisation. It is suggested klebsiella micro-organisms may carry antigenic determinants which resemble vitreous humour antigens.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - Studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. MIC of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (36 strains), Escherichia coli (35 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). MIC of cefoxitin against S. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. Many strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that showed high MIC to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. It is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. MIC of cefoxitin against H. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. Serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. The serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. The mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. The mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours after the injection. 3. In order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. As for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. As for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of H. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli and Neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for Enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. No side effect was observed in any case. Abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each of reduction of RBC and Hb, elevation of GOT and GPT and elevation of GPT, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefoxitin in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefoxitin (CFX) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Fifteen patients were treated with 73-125 mg/kg per day of CFX by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (4), pneumonia (2), pertussis and pneumonia (1), urinary tract infection (3); and the remaining 5 patients were esteemed to have nonbacterial infections. All the 10 patients of bacterial infections were cured after the CFX therapy. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Escherichia coli (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). All the strains isolated were susceptible to CFX, but the 2 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae had relatively high MIC values (12.5 mcg/ml). Diarrhea (3 cases) and transient neutropenia (1 case) were found to be associated with the CFX therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half-life of the serum level was short (24.1 minutes) and excretion into the urine was rapid. CSF concentration obtained 30 minutes after an intravenous injection of 50 mg/kg of CFX in 1 case with inflamed meninges was considerably high (8.3 mcg/ml). CFX appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.

TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Effect of extracellular serum in the stimulation of intracellular killing of streptococci by human monocytes.
AB  - This study shows that the intracellular killing of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae by human monocytes is stimulated by the extracellular presence of both heat-stable and heat-labile serum factors. A similar kind of stimulation of monocytes has been described in respect of catalase-positive microorganisms. However, killing of these bacteria is negligible in the absence of extracellular serum factors, whereas a large proportion of the ingested catalase-negative bacteria are killed in the absence of such extracellular stimuli. Monocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which are unable to kill Staphylococcus aureus even in the presence of extracellular serum, killed S. pyogenes equally effectively whether serum was present or absent. This index proved to be the same as that for killing by monocytes of healthy subjects in the absence of serum. Taken together, these results indicate that catalase-negative microorganisms possess some kind of suicide mechanism that leads to the death of these bacteria after their ingestion by monocytes in the absence of an extracellular stimulus. Furthermore, the mechanism by which extracellular serum stimulates intracellular killing probably involves enzymes of the O2-dependent bactericidal mechanisms of the monocytes.

TI  - Acute mastoiditis in infants and children.
AB  - During a 25-year period, 57 cases of acute mastoiditis occurred in infants and young children who ranged in age from 2 months to 12 years of age. All patients had abnormalities of the tympanic membrane and most had fever and localized edema and redness of the overlying skin. Fifty per cent of the infants who were less than one year of age had swelling primarily above the involved ear pushing the pinna out and down. By contrast, older children had swelling of the skin overlying the mastoid process which produced the classical finding of an elevated earlobe. Mastoid roentgenograms were a useful adjunct to diagnosis, revealing concurrent osteomyelitis in 9 patients. A diagnosis of specific bacterial etiology was made in 80 per cent of the patients in whom cultures were performed. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were the bacteria most frequently isolated. Unusual manifestations or serious complications occurred in 53 per cent of the patients, including one death (due to meningitis). These data indicate that the frequency of serious complications from acute mastoiditis has not declined over the past 3 decades.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
AB  - The chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. Miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.
TI  - Transferability of macrolide, lincomycin, and streptogramin resistances between group A, B, and D streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The transferability of plasmid pRI405 between various streptococci of groups A, B, and D, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus is described. pRI405 originated from Streptococcus faecalis and encodes for resistance to macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B (MLS resistance). The host range of the well-documented streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 was found to be similar to that of pRI405. Cleavage with restriction enzymes suggests that pRI405 belongs to a related family of MLS resistance plasmids.
TI  - Cefaclor levels in human aqueous humor.
AB  - In an attempt to investigate penetration of cefaclor into human aqueous humor, we administered 500-mg and 1-g doses of cefaclor to 39 patients about to undergo cataract extraction. Average aqueous humor levels of 0.27, 0.27, and 0.17 microgram/mL were achieved at 1, 2, and 4 hours, respectively, after the 500-mg oral dose. After 1 g orally, we found average aqueous humor levels of 0.61, 0.64, 0.72, 0.4, and 0.31 microgram/mL at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours, respectively. Therapeutic levels in primary aqueous humor were consistently achieved against Streptococcus pneumoniae and St pyogenes, group A.
TI  - Interaction between environmental pollutants and respiratory infections.
AB  - The major aspects that must be considered in studies of the health effects of environmental pollutants are: the direct damage due to the exposure, the role of pre-existing disease, and effects of the exposure on the response to secondary stresses. In experimental studies at concentrations of air pollutants found in urban environments frank toxicological responses are rarely observed. However, exposure to a secondary stress, i.e. respiratory challenge with infectious bacteria, can exacerbate the response of the experimental host. Changes in the resistance to respiratory infections provide a highly sensitive experimental animal model system, which is increasingly used in studies of health effects of air pollutants. This model indicates the impairment of the basic defense mechanisms of the respiratory system by the combined exposure to low concentrations of pollutants and the superimposed bacterial infection. Changes in the resistance to respiratory infections were studied in various species of laboratory animals. S. pyogenes and K. pneumoniae are the bacteria of choice to induce the pulmonary infection. Included in the studies are short-term single and multiple exposures as well as long-term exposures to gaseous pollutants such as O3 and NO2 and particulate pollutants such as sulfates and nitrates. Changes in the resistance are measured as excess mortalities and reduced survival time as compared to those in infected animals not exposed to the pollutants. Other parameters measured ranged from changes in the immune response to changes in retention rates of bacteria in lungs.

TI  - Specific proteolysis of human IgA by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are among the most common bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections in otherwise healthy humans. Thirty-six strains of S. pneumoniae, 62 strains of H. influenzae, six hospital-acquired respiratory pathogens, and a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes were examined for production of IgA protease, a bacterial enzyme whose only known substrate is human IgA1. IgA protease was produced by 100% of the isolates of S. pneumoniae and 98% of the isolates of H. influenzae. The enzyme from both species cleaved human serum and secretory IgA1 proteins, but not human IgA2, IgG, or human serum albumin. None of the hospital-acquired pathogens had detectable IgA protease activity, a finding indicating that the production of this enzyme distinguishes S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae from the opporunistic respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of Propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The protection showed a biphasic pattern. The maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with P. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. The activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4 and 12. The delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. The early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin D, or cyclophosphamide. The number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. The number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. Total activities of acid phosphatase, Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of P. acnes vaccine.
TI  - Comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam LY127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and Serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. These strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, LY127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (HR 756), and cefoperazone (T 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the same hospital in 1979. Susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. Strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins and other effective antibiotics. The agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. The multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935 and cefotaxime. P. aeruginosa (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. All three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. Providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935. The three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to LY127935. None of the three new beta-lactams was active against S. faecalis. All were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Study of the teratogenic activity of ribosomal vaccine.
AB  - The investigation on the possible teratogenic activity of a vaccinal formula of ribosomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes A12 and Haemophilus influenzae (D 53) was carried out in three animal species: rats, mice, rabbits. The trials were performed on two generatins of rats and mice, and on one single generation of rabbits. D 53 was given in s.c. injections (6 days a week) for 8 days before mating the females, and then until the females dropped (or were sacrificed when foetuses had to be removed by Caesarean operation). The possible teratogenic or embryotoxic effects of D 53 were evaluated using the following checks: fertility rates in the mated females; rates of placenta-foetal resorptions; abnormalites in foetuses and offspring (dissection and skeletal staining). In the above experimental conditions, D 53 had no embryotoxic and teratogenic activity in the 3 animal species used.
TI  - Immunoglobulin production in man stimulated by an orally administered bacterial lysate.
AB  - The concentrations of secretory immunoglobulins in the saliva, and of immunoglobulin in the serum, have been measured by the radial immunodiffusion method in 12 healthy volunteers, before and after oral administration of Broncho-Vaxom which is a lysate of bacteria that usually cause infection in the upper respiratory tract. The mean concentration of secretory IgA in the saliva was increased by over 100% after the 10-day administration of the product. This increase was statistically significant between the 20th and 33rd day after the beginning of the treatment (p < 0.05). It fell to a normal level after a month in 4 subjects who received one treatment course only. In 8 subjects who received a second treatment course beginning 1 month after termination of the first course, the high concentration of IgAs in the saliva persisted for at least 3 months. A significant increase in the serum concentrations of IgG of about 50% and of IgM of at least 100% above the initial level was observed in the treated subjects in the time between day 35 and 5 months after the beginning of the experiment (p < 0.05).

The study of these fractions concerned purified ribosomes extracted from the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilius influenzae, Steptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes A12. Specific antibodies determination by immunoelectro diffusion (IED) and passive hemagglutination (PHA) were used to study the immune response.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleases of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Three DNases, designated 1, 2 and 3 have been isolated from lysates of old (incompetent in genetic transformation) and logarithmic phase (competent) Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis cells. These DNases have different electrophoretic mobilities and immunological properties. Influence of some activators and inhibitors on their activity was determined. Molecular weights of 3 DNases are in the range of 52,000--57,000. All these enzymes are endonucleases which degrade native DNA; thermally denatured DNA is a poor substrate. The enzymes described in this paper differ from the previously known DNases of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nucleases similar or identical to the Challis strain enzymes have been found in two other S. sanguis strains--Wicky and Blackburn.
TI  - Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of serious infections  in children.
AB  - Intravenous TMP-SMZ was used to treat 19 infectious episodes in 18 patients ranging in age from 3 weeks to 13 years. Thirteen patients with various soft tissue or skeletal infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, or Acinetobacter anitratus were successfully treated. Three children with four episodes of CSF shunt infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci were treated successfully also. The only treatment failures were in two newborn infants with enteric gram-negative bacterial ventriculitis. TMP-SMZ was given at a daily dose of 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, every six hours. The drug was administered intravenously for a mean duration of 10 days (range 4 to 32); in 11 patients this was followed by oral administration for a mean of nine days (range 2 to 18). Half-life of TMP after intravenous administration was 5 1/4 hours; that of SMA was 8 1/2 hours. Levels determined three to four days after starting therapy were generally higher than levels obtained at corresponding times after the first dose. CSF/blood TMP and SMA ratios, determined in four patients, were 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. Side effects were observed in 14 patients, and neutropenia was the most common adverse reaction. Intravenous TMP-SMZ is an effective antimicrobic agent in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms. The frequent side effects, although reversible and of no major clinical consequence, suggest that future use of TMP-SMZ should be monitored closely.
TI  - Role of interferon in mice in protection against influenza A virus by bacterial ribosomes together with membranal glycoproteins of Klebsiella pneumoniae as adjuvant.
AB  - Nonspecific protection against infectious aerosols of influenza A virus was obtained in Swiss mice after vaccination by aerosols of bacterial ribosomes together with membranal glycoproteins extracted from Klebsiella pneumoniae as the adjuvant. It was shown that repeated stimulant aerosols were necessary to obtain this protection. Routine estimation of serum interferon levels after administration of the association of ribosomes plus membranal glycoproteins to the animals by aerosol or intravenous route showed that there was no correlation between protection and the presence of serum interferon. It was shown that the serum interferon-inducer activity was due to ribosomes. No induction of serum interferon was obtained with membranal glycoproteins used separately. Local liberation of interferon in the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract was not investigated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY 127935 (6059-S), seven cephalosporins, three  aminoglycosides, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - LY 127935 (6059-S), a new semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic was tested simultaneously with 6 cephalosporins, 3 aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against 398 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Many of the organisms were selected for study because of known resistance to one or more of the clinically available antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia and Providencia were susceptible to LY 127935. Some resistant strains of Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were also resistant to LY 127935, but many of the strains resistant to other antibiotics were susceptible to LY 127935. The activity of LY 127935 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus bovis was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine. LY 127935 was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus nor enterococcus.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - 3-[(1,2,3-Thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins.
AB  - The syntheses of ten 3-](1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins, made by displacement of the 3'-acetoxy group by the novel thiol derivatives, potassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-thiolate and dipotassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-4-carboxylate-5-thiolate, are described. Several of the compounds showed good in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The subcutaneous in vivo activities against Staphylococcus aureus were generally less than that of cafazolin. Four of the compounds were administered orally and all were active; the 7 beta-(thiophen-2-acetamido) and 7 beta-(D-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido)-3-[(1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl] compounds were equally active by either route, with a PD50 of ca. 1 mg/kg.
TI  - Susceptibility of streptococci to newer tetracyclines and cephalosporins and to other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty-nine strains of Streptococcus including 71 strains of Group A, 81 strains of Group B, 69 strains of enterococci, and 18 strains of S. pneumoniae were tested against 12 antimicrobial agents using an agar dilution method. Cefamandole was the most active cephalosporin tested. Doxycycline and minocycline were more active than tetracycline, although the tetracyclines were considerably less inhibitory than the cephalosporins. Regression line analysis of zones of inhibition versus minimal inhibitory concentration values for tetracycline and minocycline showed the tetracycline disc to be unacceptable for predicting the susceptibility of the Group A Streptococcus to minocycline. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, and spectinomycin are also given.
TI  - Intradermal responses to common bacterial antigens: influences of sex and clinical condition.
AB  - Intradermal responses to antigens of 12 common bacteria were evaluated in 218 dermatologic and 155 respiratory patients. Women responded more frequently than men and respiratory patients responded significantly more frequently than dermatologic patients to certain antigens. Interpretation of interspecies associations of responses suggested that certain organisms may be key species in the development of bacterial hypersensitivity.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - Cefadroxil (Duricef, Mead Johnson and Company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. Whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. In this kinetic model, cefadroxil was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of Escherichia coli. The other strain of E. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. S. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. Analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.
TI  - [Sensitivity of frequent-occurring isolates in outpatients to routinely-used antibiotics (author's transl)].
AB  - The susceptibility of microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae) frequently occurring in outpatients (treated by practitioners) to six kinds of antibiotics [ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), erythromycin (EM), minocycline (MNC), gentamicin (GM) and thiamphenicol (TP)] was determined by the standard method established by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. 1) There were few multiple-antibiotic-resistant urine isolates from patients with a simple urinary tract infection, whereas urine isolates from patients with a complicated urinary tract infection contained many multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 2) Isolates from patients with a respiratory tract infection (sputum and tonsillar secretions isolates) and isolates from patients with acute purulent otitis media (purulent discharge isolates) contained few multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms except for EM-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. 3) Superficial pus isolates contained many multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms, while bile isolates were relatively free from multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 4) When the results of the previous8,9) and present investigations were compared with the reports of other Japanese investigators1,5,6), suggestive evidence was provided that organisms resistant to macrolides and chloramphenicol showed a tendency to decrease, whereas organisms resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics were on the increase.
TI  - The microbiology of serous and mucoid otitis media.
AB  - One hundred forty-four serous and mucoid effusions were cultured for aerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and virus. Thirty percent of all effusions yielded an unequivocally positive culture for aerobic bacteria. Although serous effusions were culture positive as often as mucoid effusions, Haemophilus influenzae was isolated predominantly from serous effusions and Staphylococcus epidermidis predominantly from mucoid samples. Only one of 73 effusions yielded a viral isolate (Herpesvirus hominis). None of 33 effusions yielded M pneumoniae, and only one of 17 effusions yielded an anaerobe (Propionibacterium). These findings suggest that aerobic bacteria may play a role in the pathogensis of serous and mucoid otitis media.
TI  - The nasopharyngeal culture in acute otitis media. A reappraisal of its usefulness.
AB  - Simultaneous cultures of the nasopharynx and middle ear exudate (obtained by tympanocentesis) were obtained from 225 children (mean age, 34 months; median age, 41 months) with suppurative otitis media. A 72% prediction rate for middle ear pathogens was obtained by examining the nasopharyngeal cultures after the strict observance of two essential prerequisites: (1) the nasopharyngeal culture was immediately plated on appropriate solid agar and (2) a semiquantitative method for bacterial enumeration was employed in the reading of the nasopharyngeal culture plates. The technique was most valuable where 2+ (greater than 25% up to 50% of total number of colonies was a single pathogen) or greater of a single pathogen was recovered from the nasopharynx. In only one instance, the semiquantitative nasopharyngeal culture incorrectly predicted the middle ear pathogen if one was recovered. Quantitative nasopharyngeal cultures were particularly useful in predicting the presence of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci as causative agents in otitis media.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Septicemia in association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
AB  - Fifty consecutive episodes of septicemia were studied in 41 children who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Seventy-six percent of these episodes occurred when the absolute granulocyte count was 200/mm3 or less and were caused by gram-negative enteric and gram-positive mucocutaneous bacteria. In eight patients, Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated at the time when ALL was diagnosed. Multiple anaerobic and aerobic isolates from a single blood culture were associated with abdominal distress, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae septicemia occurred in associated with respiratory illnesses. When patients with severe compromise of anatomic barriers or respiratory disease were excluded, 94% of all patients with septicemia had an AGC of less than 200/mm3. The data provide guidelines for treatment for febrile patients with ALL based upon the AGC, the phase of the disease, and on the presence of associated respiratory or abdominal findings.
TI  - [Treatment of bronchitis with cefaclor (Panoral) (author's transl)].
AB  - 14 patients from the Allergy Unit of an outpatient clinic suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and 13 outpatients with acute bronchitis were treated with 250 mg cefaclor (Panoral) 3 times daily per os for 5 days. 59% of the organisms isolated from cefaclor-sensitive sputum at the time of prominent clinical symptoms were resistent to tetracycline, 53% of them were resistant to penicillin, and 37% were resistant to ampicillin. 12 out of the 14 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis became asymptomatic, and no organisms could be detected in the sputum of 13 out of the same 14 patients two days after cessation of cefaclor treatment. In 12 out of the 13 patients with acute bronchitis, the acute clinical symptoms disappeared and in 11 out of the 13 patients the initial sputum organisms were two days after stopping cefaclor treatment.
TI  - BL-S786 (ceforanide), a new parenteral cephalosporin: in vitro studies.
AB  - BL-S786 (ceforanide) is a new cephalosporin which showed broad-spectrum activity  in vitro against 453 clinical isolates. At a concentration of 3.12 mug/ml, it inhibited greater than 75% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Essentially no activity was observed against isolates of Serratia marcescens, and only minimal activity was observed against Enterobacter spp. Its activity was directly related to the size of the inoculum. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar to the minimal inhibitory concentrations for isolates of all organisms except S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for these organisms.
TI  - Factors causing the clumping reaction of streptococcal strains with human plasma.
AB  - Fresh isolates of 204 strains of Streptococcus haemolyticus, 75 strains of viridans group Streptococcus, and 45 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were studied for their clumping reactions with human plasma. The plasma and serum factors that clumped the streptococcal strains were compared with those that clumped a Staphylococcus aureus strain. One hundred eleven strains of S. haemolyticus, 10 strains of viridans group Streptococcus, and none of the strains of S. pneumoniae tested were clumped by human plasma. However, clumping activity was remarkably unstable after subculturing on plates containing Todd-Hewitt blood agar. The strain with the highest level of activity was clumped by fibrinogen and normal human serum. Results of tests of the clumping reactions of staphylococci and streptococci with human serum indicated that the serum factors responsible for those reactions may be identical.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Eighty-one adults with symptoms of acute sinusitis were studied by direct needle  puncture and aspiration of the maxillary sinus (105 sinuses). Fifty-nine bacterial strains were isolated in titers of greater than or equal to 10(4) colony-forming units/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 64% of the isolates. Other bacteria recovered included anaerobes (12%), Neisseria species (8.5%). Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), non-group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), and Escherichia coli (2%). Viruses were isolated from 11 sinuses; these isolates included rhinovirus (six), influenza A (H3N2) virus (three), and two types of parainfluenza virus (one each). The efficacy of therapy with orally administered ampicillin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was evaluated by a repeat sinus puncture and culture. Clinical and bacteriologic responses to all three regimens were good.
TI  - Studies on the inhibitory effects of zinc heptanoate on microorganisms.
AB  - Inhibitory effect of zinc heptanoate was observed on different cultures of bacteria and fungi. Growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by the compound. Greatest inhibition was seen in the case of Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, Vibrio cholerae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and E. coli whereas least inhibition was found in the case of Staphylococcus aureus. In triethanolamine: water (1:1) solution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was least for Klebsiella pneumoniae (800 p.p.m.) while in the case of Staph. aureus and Bacillus subtilis it was 200 p.p.m. Among yeasts and fungi greatest inhibition was found with Trichophyton schoenleini, T. rubrum, T. gourvili, Microsporum adouini, M. vanbreuseghemi and least in the case of Candida albicans. In triethanolamine: water (1:1) solution the MIC for T. schoenleini and T. gourvili and T. violaceum was as low as 900 p.p.m. whereas in the case of Aspergillus oryzae it was highest--3500 p.p.m. The effect of the compound on glucose consumption of Aspergillus niger and Bacillus subtilis was also seen.
TI  - [Studies in the BALB/c mouse of the efficiency of spraying as compared to other inoculation ways for immunostimulant (author's transl)].
AB  - The of efficiency of spraying as compared to intranasal and digestive ways was tested on Balb/c mouse by using on the one hand an immunostimulant product and on the other various types of test : Myxovirus influenzae by aerosol, Streptococcus pyogenes intranasally, Klebsiella pneumoniae intraperitoneally. Results showed that in the case of influenza virus the immunostimulant inhaled as liquid aerosol or powder aerosol, or deposited on the nasal mucosa was very active. When the test germ was Streptococcus and the contamination intra-nasal, only the homologous way was efficient. When the test germ was Klebsiella pneumonia all inoculation forms except powder aerosol were effective. The comparative study of aerosols granulometry helps grasping this phenomenon.
TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - Comparative study of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin antimicrobial activity against human respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - An in vitro test system was used to compare the antimicrobial activity of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin against respiratory tract pathogens isolated from man. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fresh clinical isolates of Streptoccus pyogenes, Streptocuccus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae to the macrolide and penicillins ranged between 0.01 and 0.9 microgram/ml. The microbes were exposed to each antibiotic for approximately 3 h at 1x,2x and 5x the relevant MIC. Irreversible surface defects and intracellular lesions were resolved by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in all antibiotic-treated bacterial species, irrespective of the antimicrobial used. In each case, inhibition of growth was recorded by turbometric assay; no significant difference was observed among the declining slopes of post-dosing growth curves for either erythromycin-, amoxicillin- or ampicillin-treated pathogens. The experimental observations show that the onset of antimicrobial activity and the bactericidal effectiveness of equipotent concentrations of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin were comparable in this study. The results complement previous clinical, bacteriologic and ultrastructure studies in vivo and demonstrate the contribution of the combined in vivo/in vitro study design for better understanding of antimicrobial activity in human respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vivo activity of amoxicillin and ampicillin against gram-positive bacteria: results of prophylactic studies.
AB  - In prophylactic treatment of intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae (types 1 and 2) and Streptococcus pyogenes in mice, amoxicillin had a definite advantage over ampicillin in terms of protective effect. When the infecting agent was given to mice so as to produce an infection in the brain or lung (for example, S. pneumoniae given intracranially or intranasally), amoxicillin was also more effective prophylactically than ampicillin.
TI  - Beta hemolytic streptococcal endocarditis: predominance of non-group A organisms.
AB  - Identification of beta hemolytic streptococci (BHS) as group A or non-group A on  the basis of bacitracin sensitivity rather than Lancefield serogrouping may lead to misidentification of the pathogen. In four recent cases of endocarditis due to BHS, the pathogens initially were identified as group A; Lancefield serogrouping showed all four to be group G. All four patients presented with a syndrome characteristic of acute bacterial endocarditis. Review of all cases of endocarditis at our institution for the past five years showed none due to group A BHS. In 166 previously reported cases of endocarditis due to BHS, 68 pathogens were serogrouped: 53 belonged to groups B, C, G, or H; only five were group A. Our four cases and review of the literature demonstrate the need for Lancefield serogrouping in serious beta hemolytic streptococcal infections, rather than reliance on bacitracin sensitivity.
TI  - HR 756, the syn isomer of a new methoxyimino cephalosporin with unusual antibacterial activity.
AB  - HR 756, the syn derivative of 7-[(2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino)acetamido]cephalosporanic acid, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin. It was 80 times more active than the anti derivative against beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacteria. The range of inhibitory concentrations of HR 756 against gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, susceptible or resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins was from 0.01 to 0.1 mug/ml. This activity was consistently higher than those observed with cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cefazolin. Nevertheless, some strains of Enterobacter cloacae were resistant. HR 756 showed very similar activity to that of ampicillin against group A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Trends in bacterial virulence and antibiotic susceptibility: streptococci, pneumococci, and gonococci.
AB  - Antibiotic usage and improved living conditions may have contributed to a dilution of "rheumatogenic" strains of group A streptococci and to their replacement by attenuated streptococci with less rheumatogenic potential. Whether this is due to decreased virulence or to loss of specific bacterial antigens or toxins in prevalent strains is not yet known. The pneumococcus, which has been moderately resistant to antibiotics only in isolated cases, has appeared in South Africa in strains that are highly resistant to at least five major antibiotics; plasmid transmission of resistance is suspected. The newly available pneumococcal vaccine may become very important if such strains spread. Gonococci isolated from urogenital lesions have developed only moderate drug resistance. Gonococci causing disseminated infection have retained their exquisite sensitivity to penicillin; the most virulent strains are associated with greatest sensitivity. However, the newly discovered penicillinase-plasmid in gonococci is transferable to these virulent strains as readily as to others.
TI  - Microbiology of recurrent and chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  - A study was conducted of 274 children who had recurrent acute or chronic otitis media with effusion. Forty-five percent of the ears with effusion were found to contain bacteria, and 11% contained bacteria that were "probable pathogens" (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes). Bacteria were also found in 40% of the ears without effusions. The type of organism found did not vary with the age of the patient studied or the season of the year. The significance of these bacteria in the etiology of recurrent acute or chronic otitis media with effusion remains to be demonstrated.
TI  - Group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin: pyrogenicity, alteration of blood-brain barrier, and separation of sites for pyrogenicity and enhancement of lethal endotoxin shock.
AB  - Group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type C (SPE C) was shown to produce fever by crossing the blood-brain barrier. The toxin directly stimulated the hypothalamic fever response control center, thus bypassing a requirement for endogenous pyrogen release. SPE C was detected in the cerebrospinal fluids of toxin-treated rabbits by pyrogen tests and a hemagglutination inhibition assay. The toxin altered the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to endotoxin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae as well as to itself. SPE C did not alter the in vivo differential and total counts of peripheral blood leukocytes and did not elicit endogenous pyrogen release from leukocytes in vitro. In vivo, peripheral blood platelet counts remained unchanged after SPE treatment. Cycloheximide pretreatment of rabbits did not inhibit fever production by SP C. In contrast to the hypothermia observed in mice treated with endotoxin intravenously susceptibility to lethal endotoxin shock. The abilities of SPE C to produce fever and enhance lethal shock were shown to be separate functions of the molecule; fever results from stimulation of the hypothalamus, and enhancement appears not to involve the central nervous system.
TI  - A study of acute respiratory disease in the community of Port Chalmers. I. Illnesses within a group of selected families and the relative incidence of respiratory pathogens in the whole community.
AB  - A study of respiratory diseases in the semi-isolated community of Port Chamlers,  New Zealand, began in April 1973. The intensive surveillance of a selected group fo 26 families involved the weekly reporting of illness, the collection of specimens for virus, Group A streptococci and Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolation and the collection of sera at 6-month intervals. A total of 956 illnesses were reported during 32 months. The median number of illnesses per year were: infants 4.4, children 2.5, female adults 2.4 and male adults 2.0. Of all these illnesses, 57% were upper respiratory, 31% were lower respiratory and 9% were enteric. The severity of these illnesses was not greater than would be expected in open communities. Surveillance by pathogen isolation only of the whole community through the patients in the general practice was carried out concurrently. A total of 640 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from which 161 viruses, 47 Group A streptococci and 2 M. pneumoniae were isolated. The overall isolation rate was 33%. The similarities between the epidemiological patterns of respiratory disease in the open community and the isolated community are discussed.
TI  - Clinical and laboratory investigation of cefamandole in infections of infants and children.
AB  - Forty-seven infants and children with a variety of infections including bacteremia, ethmoiditis, and periorbital cellulitis, soft tissue infection, pneumonia, and lymphadenitis were treated with intravenous cefamandole. The infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The clinical response was prompt, and, with the exception of two cases who developed skin rash, significant side effects were not noted. In vitro cefamandole was very effective in inhibiting the growth of H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates.
TI  - Immuno-stimulation by a ribosomal vaccine associated with a bacterial cell wall adjuvant in humans.
AB  - We have studied a new vaccine of ribosomal nature associated with glycoprotein cell walls from Klebsiella pneumoniae which served as an immunoadjuvant. Thus vaccine was administered by the aerosol route to working men free of any important disease, especially of respiratory disease. A total of 104 men working for the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, all volunteers, were randomly placed into two groups. During the first period, 51 patients (group I) were vaccinated three times a week during 5 weeks, and the second group was used as control. During the second period, which started on day 225, the control group received the vaccine, and the first group was revaccinated. Results of this experience show a significant difference in the immunity of the two groups. The specific antibodies increased with vaccination as illustrated by chi-square test (Yates correction), which corresponds to an independent probability equal to 0 (P = 0.5 X 10-4).
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - Clinical and laboratory investigation of cefamandole therapy of infections in infants and children.
AB  - Cefamandole nafate was effective in the treatment of a variety of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae in infants and children. The infections included periorbital cellulitis and ethmoiditis, bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia, and lymphadenitis. In vitro, cefamandole was effective in inhibiting the growth of H. influenzae isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis or sepsis. In two patients rash developed and cefamandole was discontinued. Other significant adverse effects were not noted.
TI  - Cefamandole vs. procaine penicillin for treatment of pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae: a random trial.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of cefamandole nafate and penicillin G procaine suspension were compared in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia in hospitalized adults. One hundred thirteen patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumococcal pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive 600,000 units of procaine penicillin intramuscularly every 12 hr or 500 mg of cefamandole intramuscularly every 6 hr. The two groups were comparable with regard to patient type and extent and severity of pneumonia. Alcohol abuse was a host factor in 31% of all patients in the trial. All strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.6 microgram of cefamandole/ml. Of 58 patients treated with cefamandole, 50 had a satisfactory response, as did 46 of the 55 patients treated with penicillin. Results of tests of liver function were abnormal (primarily, elevated levels of transaminase or alkaline phosphatase) in 38% of the entire group of patients and occurred with equal frequency in patients receiving cefamandole or penicillin. Side effects during therapy, including superinfection, occurred equally with either drug. In a random trial, cefamandole was as effective and safe as penicillin in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults.
TI  - Clinical and laboratory evaluation of cefamandole in infants and children.
AB  - Fifty-three infants and children, aged three months to 15 years, were treated with an average daily dose of 100 mg of cefamandole/kg intravenously. Of these patients, 47 had soft tissue cellulitis and six had pneumonia. Primary pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, were isolated from 43 of the 53 patients. Bacteremia was documented in six of the 53 patients. A satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic response to cefamandole was achieved in all cases except on (98%). The only treatment failure occurred in an infant with both periorbital cellulitis and bacteremia due to H. influenzae who developed meningitis while receiving cefamandole; no extravasation of the drug across the blood-brain barrier could be detected in spite of inflamed meninges. In general, the only aberrant effects of cefamandole were the appearance of eosinophilia in 28% of patients and a positive indirect Cooms' test without hemolysis in one patient. Cefamandole showed excellent in vitro activity against 87 ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae. Because it has greater activity than any of the other cephalosporins against this important pediatric pathogen, cefamandole may have particular pertinence in the treatment of infections in infants and young children.
TI  - Interpatient microbiological cross-contamination after dental radiographic examination.
AB  - Pairs of patients were evaluated for microbiological cross-contamination after radiographic examination. In 30 of these pairs of patients there was the possibility of transference of S pyogenes, S aureus, or D pneumoniae. Such transference was observed in 23 (77%) of these 30 pairs of patients. The vectors for such transfer include the hands of the X-ray technician and the radiographic equipment. Further, it was found that each of these organisms would survive for at least 48 hours after being placed on an X-ray tube. Since interpatient microbiological cross-contamination can occur after routine radiographic examination, in some cases, disinfection of the radiographic equipment is indicated.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. It contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. Its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Mycobacterium lepraemurium. When used as an antigen in rabbits, the S. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. This antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of S. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other streptococci, such as S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. lactis. The inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of S. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of O(2) (-). A variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. The iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of H(2)O(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. Some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. Indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. There was no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their Gram-stain reaction.
TI  - Viruses and bacteria associated with acute respiratory illnesses in young children in general practice.
AB  - The results obtained and the laboratory methods used for the isolation of viruses and bacteria from Malaysian children with acute respiratory illnesses seen in a private clinic are described. Of the 65 children studied virus isolations were obtained from 26 children, bacteria from 10 and both virus and bacteria from another 5. The agents isolated were influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus pyogenes.

TI  - Changing ecology of acute bacterial empyema: occurrence and mortality at Boston City Hospital during 12 selected years from 1935 to 1972.
AB  - The occurrence, etiology, and demography of acute bacterial empyema are presented to reflect the widespread use of sulfonamides, penicillin, and other active antibiotics. In community-acquired (C-A) cases Streptococcus pneumoniae, hemolytic streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent single organisms identified in initial positive cultures of pleural fluid during 1935. S. pneumoniae declined steadily until 1953 but continued to occur frequently in C-A cases. Hemolytic streptococci became infrequent. S. aureus increased and became the most frequent organism in 1955 and declined to original levels after 1965 while gram-negative rods increased. S. aureus, aerobic gram-negative rods, and enterococci were most frequent in originally mixed infections, hospital-acquired cases, and superinfections. Anaerobes with or without aerobes were mostly seen in C-A cases and did not vary in incidence. Mortality increased with age. Overall mortality was greater during the 10 antibiotic years, associated with a marked decrease in the proportion of patients younger than 50 years and increase in those over 60 years old, and was greater in patients with serious underlying diseases subjected to more complicated surgical procedures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.

TI  - Specific and cross-reactive activation of rabbit peripheral blood lymphocytes by  streptococcal vaccines.
AB  - The ability of primed rabbit blood lymphocytes to respond in vitro to the homologous streptococcal group antigen depends on its presence in culture in the form of vaccine or cell walls thereof. These lymphocytes can also be stimulated in vitro by streptococcal vaccines with chemically related group antigens. The basis for this cross-stimulation apparently resides in shared rhamnose moieties. Activation of these lymphocytes was not achieved by vaccines from unrelated bacteria. There is also the suggestion that rabbits of different genetic origin differentiate between cross-stimulating antigens, probably at the level of antigenic determinants. The data support the view that recognition and response pattern of the immune system rely heavily on a network of antigens.
TI  - Biological characteristics of peptidoglycans of group A streptococcus and some other bacterial species. II. Immunological mechanisms involved in thrombocytolysis.
AB  - Immunological mechanisms are involved in the thrombocytolytic activity of peptidoglycan of Group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Inactivation of particular components of complement (heating of blood serum to 56 degrees C,incubation with zymosan or NH4OH) inhibited the thrombocytolytic activity of group A streptococcus peptidoglycan. So did preincubation of Group A streptococcus peptidoglycan with homologous antipeptidoglycan antibody. On the other hand, antibody to Group A streptococcus peptidoglycan did not inhibit the thrombocytolytic effect of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan. Human platelets are resistant to peptidoglycans. They remain resistant in the presence of rabbit serum although rabbit platelets are highly sensitive to peptidoglycans. This suggests that, for the expression of the thrombocytolytic activity of bacterial peptidoglycan, specific receptors on the surface of platelets must be present in addition to serum factors.

TI  - Secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  - Inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis. Lipid secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. This novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: S. sanguis (group H), S. pyogenes (group A), And S. pneumoniae. The secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. The occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating with resumption of culture growth. All cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. It is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.
TI  - General principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - In the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause  is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. In severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. The need for optimal dosage is emphasized. This is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. The problems leading to recurrence and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. Combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group D streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to nasal mucosal cells.
AB  - The ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. In contrast, viridans streptococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal mucosal cells. S. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of S. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (P less than 0.005). Heat treatment of S. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. The data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. The greater affinity of S. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.
TI  - [Studies on the antimicrobial effect of vitamin D (author's transl)].
AB  - In in vitro studies vitamin D3 proved inhibitory on strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. In the presence of 5x10(4)-9x10(4) IU/ml vitamin D3 the organisms were killed or reacted with a marked growth inhibition.
TI  - [In vitro examination on antibacterial activity of ciclacillin (ACPC) against clinically isolated strains (author's transl)].
AB  - (1) The antibacterial acivity of ciclacillin (ACPC) with inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml was four times less potent than that of ampicillin (ABPC) and 4 approximately 8 times less potent than that of AMPC, but was 4 approximately 8 times more potent than that of CEX against Streptococcus pyogenes. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, ACPC was 2 approximately 4 times less active than ABPC and AMPC, but 16 approximately 32 times more active than CEX. Staphylococcus aureus was 4 approximately 8 times less susceptible to ACPC than to ABPC and AMPC, but 1 approximately 2 times more susceptible than to CEX. Against E. coli, ACPC was as active as CEX, 2 approximately 4 times less active than ABPC, and 4 approximately 8 times less active than AMPC. (2) It was suposed that ACPC was more resistant to penicillinase and more antibacterial with inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml cells/ml than with 10(6) cells/ml. ACPC was 4 approximately 8 times less active than ABPC, and AMPC against Staphylococcus aureus with 10(8) cells/ml, while with 10(6) cells/ml, it was 2 times less active than ABPC and AMPC. (3) ACPC-resistant strains (greater than or equal to 3.13 microng/ml) of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were not found. (4) A difference was noted in MIC of three semi-synthetic penicillins, ACPC, ABPC and AMPC, against Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli between the sources from which their strains were isolated. (5) There were many strains resistant to erythromycin (EM) and josamycin (JM) (greater than 60%, respectively to both antibiotics) in Stretpococcus pyogenes and pus-isolated Staphylococcus aureus. No strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, were found resistant to EM and JM.
TI  - Cefadroxil, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefadroxil is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum and a high chemotherapeutic potential when administered orally. The inhibitory activity of this compound was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine when tested against 602 clinical isolates on Mueller-Hinton medium. In the oral treatment of experimental infections of mice, cefadroxil was more effective than cephalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes, and comparably effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and several gram-negative species. Administered orally to mice, at doses ranging from 25 to 100 mg/kg, cefadroxil attained peak concentrations in the blood similar to those of cephalexin. At a dose of 200 mg/kg, however, higher peak levels were noted with cefadroxil than with cephalexin. In regard to other properties which were investigated, the behavior of cefadroxil compared favorably to that of cephalexin.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance in pneumococci and group A streptococci. Report of an ad-hoc study group on antibiotic resistance.
AB  - In a nationwide survey in the spring of 1975 into the prevalence of tetracycline  resistance among pneumoccoci and group A streptococci isolates, 21 laboratories reported the sensitivity of isolates and details of the patients. Altogether 13% of the 1528 pneumococci isolated were resistant to tetracycline, but there were wide geographical variations. Thirty-six per cent of the 1515 streptococci isolated were resistant, and again there was considerable geographical variation. A high level of resistance in one organism did not correlate with a high level in the other. For both organisms resistance was commoner among inpatients and those aged 50 or over. Tetracycline should probably not be the drug of choice in penicillin-sensitive patients with group A streptococcal infections, but geographical variations were so wide that decisions on treatment are best made on the basis of local survey data.
TI  - Biological characteristics of peptidoglycans of group A streptococcus and some other bacterial species. I. Tolerance and effect of antibody in fever response, and heart damaging effect in rabbits.
AB  - Induced tolerance to the pyrogenic action of group A streptococcus peptidoglycan  decreased after one week and was no longer detectable after the second week. However, one or two further doses of peptidoglycan rapidly restored the tolerance. The passive transfer of plasma from rabbits tolerant to streptococcus peptidoglycan to nontolerant animals failed to transfer tolerance. Antiserum to streptococcus peptidoglycan neutralized the pyrogenic effect of not only streptococcus but also staphylococcus and pneumococcus peptidoglycan; it did not influence the febrile response to endotoxin. Histopathologic changes in the rabbit heart produced by the intravenous injection of staphylococcus or pneumococcus peptidoglycans were similar and were characterized by various stages of degeneration and necrosis. The changes were less pronounced than after streptococcus peptidoglycan. Antiserum to streptococcus peptidoglycan had modest or no counteracting effect on the development of heart alterations after staphylococcus or pneumococcus peptidoglycan.
TI  - Resistance mechanism of chloramphenicol in Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance of Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis isolated from clinical materials was proved to be due to an inactivating enzyme produced by these bacteria. The inactivated products of chloramphenicol were identified as 1-acetoxy, 3-acetoxy and 1,3-diacetoxy derivatives by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. The responsible enzyme was thus confirmed to be chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The enzyme was inducible. It was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. The enzymes obtained from S. haemolyticus, S. pneumoniae and S. faecalis have been compared with the conclusion that they are identical with respect to molecular weight (approximately 75,000-80,000), optimum pH and heat stability.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tibezonium (TBZ).
AB  - The activity in vitro of tibezonium (Rec 15-0691), a new 1,5-benzodiazepine derivative, has been investigated. The drug was found active especially against Streptococcus, Diplococcus and Corynebacterium strains which are agents of oropharyngeal diseases. The activity of tibezonium was pH dependent against Staphylococcus aureus SG 511 and Streptococcus pyogenes 821 (at pH 8.0-8.5 It was more active) and the presence of horse serum provoked a small decrease of the antimicrobial properties. No interference on the activity of the tibezonium has been found in presence of smokers and non-smokers saliva.
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.
TI  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin C derivative I. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6R,7R)-8-oxo-7[2-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. Ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris. The activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. Cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. The in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. Ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both S. aureus and E. coli. The development in vitro of resistance by S. aureus 209p and E. coli NIHJ to ceftezole after 16 transfers was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. Ceftezole was relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. Ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. However, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. Furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with S. aureus.
TI  - Otitis media of infancy and early childhood. A double-blind study of four treatment regimens.
AB  - A double-blind, randomized trial of four antimicrobial regimens was conducted in  383 infants and children with acute otitis media. The drugs used were penicillin V, amoxicillin trihydrate, erythromycin estolate, and erythromycin estolate with trisulfapyrimidines. Aspiration of middle ear fluid for culture was done before treatment and repeated during treatment if fluid persisted. Etiologic bacteria were most commonly pneumococci (31%) or Haemophilus sp (22%), and an additional 5% of patients had both organisms. Amoxicillin was the most effective in promoting initial response in pneumococcal infection. For Haemophilus infections, the cure rates with amoxicillin and the erythromycin-trisulfapyrimidines mixture were significantly better than with the other two regimens, and serous otitis did not occur during the follow-up period; however, new episodes of otitis were comparable in the four groups. Amoxicillin and the erythromycin estolate-trisulfapyrimidines combination appear to be somewhat more effective than penicillin V or erythromycin estolate.
TI  - Idiopathic late-onset immunoglobulin deficiency. Clinical observations in 50 patients.
AB  - Fifty patients with late-onset idiopathic immunoglobulin deficiency were studied  and the frequency of various clinical associations and complications was observed. Men and women were equally affected, although the age at onset in men peaked in the third decade whereas it was more uniformly distributed in women. Sinobronchopulmonary infections were common and were caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus: bronchiectasis occurred in 28 per cent. Thirty patients (60 per cent) had diarrhea, which was often associated with steatorrhea, giardiasis, achlorhydria, abnormal Schilling tests and morphologic abnormalities on small bowel biopsy specimens, including nodular lymphoid hyperplasia; three patients had pernicious anemia. In the 20 patients without diarrhea these abnormalities were not observed except for giardiasis in one patient and achlorhydria in two patients. Cholelithiasis occurred in both groups in about a third of the patients tested. A high degree of susceptibility to neoplasia was noted. Thyroid abnormalities, including primary hypothyroidism and Graves' disease, were observed in six patients. Additional occasional findings were vitiligo, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and arthritis. Splenomegaly occurred in 14 (28 per cent) patients. The percentage of B lymphocytes in the blood was determined in 10 patients; it was normal or slightly decreased in eight patients and low in two patients.
TI  - Susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics. Comparison of patterns in Poland and Federal Republic of Germany.
AB  - One hundred and eighty five strains of Gram-positive cocci were tested for susceptibility to 16 antibiotics, including some newer drugs, by agar dilution technique. Of these, 100 strains (50 each isolated in Poland and Germany) were Staphylococcus aureus, 55 Streptococcus pyogenes, and 30 Diplococcus pneumoniae. Previous investigations of streptococci and pneumococci isolated in Poland and Federal Republic of Grmany, revealed no differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns in both countries, which was not the case with staphylococci. Present study demonstrates further evidence for existence of differences in antibiotic-sensitivity of staphylococci, depending of their geographical origin, and presents actual state of susceptibility to antibiotics of Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Streptococcal sore throat in general practice--a controlled study.
AB  - A controlled study was undertaken to determine the incidence of Group A haemolytic streptococci and other bacterial pathogens in throat swabs from patients presenting with sore throats. The isolation rate (38-8%) of Group A haemolytic streptococci from patients with acute tonsillitis was significantly higher than the isolation rate (8-9%) in a control group, but there was no significant difference in the isolation rates in patients diagnosed as having acute pharyngitis compared with the control group. There was no difference in the isolation rates of the other bacterial pathogens in the patient and control groups. In-vitro antibiotic studies were performed, and a comparison was made of the results of these tests and the treatment prescribed.
TI  - Effect of capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. I. Induction of increased susceptibility to infections in mice.
AB  - When Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (CPS-K) from type 1, Kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with Salmonella enteritidis NUB 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with S. enteritidis NUB 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. The promotion of infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 by CPS-K depended upon its dose, the effect of CPS-K being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. In the case of S. enteritidis NUB 31, the effect of CPS-K was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. As a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that CPS-K promoted in vivo growth of S. enteritidis NUB 1 and NUB 31. In addition, CPS-K enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The peak CPS-K effect on infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. The active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of CPS-K was neutral CPS-K, which is distinct from the O antigen and from acidic CPS-K (the type-specific capsular antigen). Preparations of neutral CPS-K isolated from the other three strains of K. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the Kasuya strain. Neutral CPS-K, with identical antigenicity to that from the Kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. No parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and adjuvant activity of neutral CPS-K.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - Activity of cefamandole and other cephalosporins against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of cefamandole was comparable to that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephaloridine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae. In contrast, cefamandole was considerably more active than cephalothin, cefazolin, or cephaloridine against gram-negative facultative bacilli, including Haemophilus influenzae, the most striking disparities being noted with indole-positive Proteus and Enterobacter. Bacteroides fragilis was more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefamandole or cefazolin (median minimal inhibitory concentration, approximately 8, 32, and 32 mug/ml, respectively); cephalothin exhibited still less activity against this species. The majority of other anaerobes were inhibited by relatively low concentrations of all four cephalosporins. The results indicate a potentially valuable role for cefamandole against facultative gram-negative bacilli, including H. influenzae, but no exceptional activity against anaerobes.

TI  - Quantitative and qualitative determinations of the combined effect of tetracycline and oleandomycin. I. In vitro effect.
AB  - Growth inhibitory effect of combined treatment of tetracycline (TC) and oleandomycin (OM), at a ratio of 2:1, on certain species of pathogenic bacteria including drug-resistant ones was examined. By the crossed paper strip method, synergistic effects were demonstrated against 9 of the 16 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and all of the 5 strains of Escherichia coli studied. Antagonism was observed with none of the strains and with 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae tested in the present experiments. The MICs determined by the agar dilution method, also gave similar results, although synergism was not conclusively demonstrated by this method. With representative strains of S. aureus, synergism was evidenced by quantitative measurement of growth inhibition. In some strains, 1.0 mug of one drug per ml of medium inhibited the induction of resistance to the second drug. Such a small dose of one drug also inhibited the development of a mutant resistant to the second drug. These inhibitory actions were thought to be one of the important factors causing the synergistic effect of TC and OM on drug resistant bacteria.

TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Microorganisms in chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  - A total of 175 effusions obtained from 172 patients suffering from chronic otitis media with effusions was examined for bacterial smear and culture. Eighty percent showed positive bacterial smear, but only 49% yielded positive bacterial culture. The mucoid effusions had positive cultures in only 37%, whereas the bacterial culture rate was higher in serous (59%) and leukocytic (64%) types. The isolation of common pathogens accounted for about 50% of the isolates, and nonpathogens accounted for the remaining 50%. The high incidence of microorganisms in the middle ear effusions in the present series raises the possibility of bacterial contribution in many cases of OME.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility studies with josamycin and erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of josamycin and erythromycin against five bacterial species was compared. In general, erythromycin was slightly more active by weight than josamycin, although both agents had a similar range of activity.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefoxitin, cephamycin C, cepharadine and cefazolin was determined against 443 isolates of bacteria. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, all of the cephalosporins inhibited more than 60% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. At the same concentration, cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephamycin C and cefazolin inhibited more than 90% of isolates of proteus mirabilis. All of the cephalosporins except cephalothin and cephapirin inhibited over 60% of isolates of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against gram-negative bacilli. There was substantial differences in the activity of cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci. Cephaloridine was the most active cephalosporin against these organisms. There was considerable fluctuation in the proportion of isolates of gram-negative bacilli susceptible to these cephalosporins from year to year, but there was no evidence to suggest that the number of resistant isolates was increasing.

TI  - Tobramycin: a review of its antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  - SYNOPSIS: Tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum in vitro, and pharmacokinetic properties similar to those for gentamicin. Tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and active against many gentamicin resistant strains, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae resistant to gentamicin. Theoretically, tobramycin has an advantage over gentamicin against infections caused by P. aeruginosa, but any advantage in clinical practice has yet to be adequately demonstrated. Clinical experience with tobramycin is considerably less than with gentamicin. Whilst tobramycin appears to offer no clear advantages over gentamicin against sensitive organisms it is indicated in infection caused by strains of P. aeruginosa which are resistant to gentamicin, but sensitive to tobramycin. Like gentamicin, tobramycin acts synergistically with corbenicillin and the cephalosporins. The efficacy of the tobramycin-carbenicillin combination has been shown in endocarditis caused by P. aeruginosa which was unresponsive to gentamicin plus carbenicillin. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity similar to that seen with other animoglycosides have been encountered in therapeutic trials with tobramycin and wider clinical experience is necessary to determine the relative incidence of these side-effects with gentamicin and tobramycin used under similar conditions. Antimicrobial activity: In comparative studies, in vitro, tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, the inhibitory index, which is the ratio between the serum concentration attained at usual therapuetic doses and the minimum inhibitory concentration, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher for tobramycin than for gentamicin. Against Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas spp. the spectrum of activity of tobramycin is similar to that of gentamicin. For most species the activity of tobramycin is slightly less than that of gentamicin. Gentamicin is consistently more active than tobramycin against Serratia marcescens. Like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, tobramycin is active in vitro in low concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus. Tobramycin is essentially inactive against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). Maner aminoglycosides and of other antibiotics against various bacteria in vitro, but comparisons between studies cannot always be interpreted literally because the activity of many antibiotics in vitro, including tobramycin, is influenced by the nature of the culture media and the presence of certain salts. The sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin is influenced by the magnesium, and calcium content of the culture media whilst that of all species is reduced by sodium ions. Wide variations in the concentration of these ions may result in divergent MIC values and an inappropriate choice of antibacterial agent to treat pseudomonas infection...

TI  - Bactericidal activity and pharmacology of flucloxacillin.
AB  - Flucloxacillin, a recent addition to the group of isoxazolyl penicillins, was studied in vitro and in normal volunteers. The bactericidal activity of the drug against most strains of gram-positive bacteria including penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was similar to that of oxacillin and approximately fourfold greater than that of cloxacillin. Each of the three penicillins was administered orally to a group of ten volunteers for eight days in a dose of 500 mg four times a day. The mean concentrations of flucloxacillin in the serum were two- to sixfold higher than those of the other two agents on the first, fourth and eighth days of therapy. The percentage of flucloxacillin bound by serum protein was 94.6 per cent; for cloxacillin and oxacillin the values were 93.5 and 91.5 per cent, respectively. Using these data, the concentrations of free flucloxacillin in serum were found to be twice as high as those of cloxacillin and oxacillin. These findings suggest that, when administered orally, this new agent may offer some therapeutic advantage over oxacillin and cloxacillin.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.
TI  - Comparative study of virological infections in asthmatic and nonasthmatic children.
AB  - The author shows complex analyses: clinical, laboratory, X-rays, bronchoscopical, bronchographical and measuring lung function tests as well as the serological examinations in blood serum of both groups of asthmatic and nonasthmatic children with virological infection. The calculation of statistically significant differences between the various diagnostical results of both groups has confirmed that in asthmatic children virological infection of the respiratory tract, pathological findings in X-ray and lung function tests, bronchiectasis and secondary bacteriological invasion occurs statistically significantly more often than in nonasthmatic children.
TI  - Growth of common bacteria and Candida albicans in 10% soybean oil emulsion.
AB  - Bacterial and fungal growth in 10% soybean oil emulsion (Intralipid) and 5% fibrin hydrolysate in 5% dextrose was studied at 4, 25 and 37 degrees C. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. fecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were grown in broth at 37 degrees C, diluted in saline and inoculated into each of the two preparations as well as a mixture of the two. Growth was measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. In 10% soybean emulsion, all bacteria except S. pyogenes multiplied, but in fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solution the only organism of those studied to grow was S. aureus. In the hydrolysate-dextrose-lipid mixture, all organisms multiplied except S. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa. C. albicans grew in all solutions tested. While at 4 degrees C, organisms did not multiply. The fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solutions given by infusion into a central vein for hyperalimentation have been shown to support predominantly fungal growth, and contamination of the solution and ultimately of the indwelling catheter is a constant hazard. Because both bacteria and C. albicans grew equally well in 10% soybean oil emulsion, its use as a caloric source when infused into a central vein may increase the occurrence of sepsis. When this emulsion is used to provide essential fatty acids or calories, it should be given via a peripheral vein, so that a central catheter will not be contaminated.
TI  - Acute otitis media. A clinical bacteriological and serological study of children  with frequent episodes of acute otitis media.
AB  - A series of episodes of acute otitis media was studied with reference to bacterial findings and specific serological responses in 48 children with histories of frequent episodes before. D. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Re-isolations after therapy were often made in episodes with slow healing or therapeutic failure. Most children harboured pathogens in nasopharynx even when they had no signs of respiratory tract infections. Homologous relapses were seen only in few cases and never with pneumococcus type 3 and only once with H. influenzae type b. Specific serological responses were demonstrable generally in children over 2 years of age. D. pneumococcus type 3 and H. influenzae type b generally provoked antibody response. No levels indicating immunoglobulin deficiencies could be found in the children.

AB  - Cephalexin monohydrate suspension was used in the treatment of 97 children with otitis media. Pretreatment middle-ear exudate specimens in pure or mixed culture yielded Diplococcus pneumoniae in 47 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 26, Neisseria catarrhalis in 20, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in 13, and Staphylococcus aureus in one. The usual dosage was 100 mg/kg/day given orally in divided doses for 10 to 12 days. After 48 hours of treatment, follow-up cultures showed that therapy had been successful in 90 children; 81 remained clinically and bacteriologically free of disease for at least three weeks following therapy. Of the seven children for whom therapy failed, H influenzae persisted in five and D pneumoniae in two. Acceptance of the drug was entirely satisfactory with no important side effects encountered.
TI  - [Microbiological study of gentamiycin].
AB  - Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Massive empyema due to Citrobacter diversus.
AB  - Citrobacter diversus is a gram-negative rod member of the Enterobacteriacease family. A patient is described from whom this organism was isolated twice in pure culture from empyema fluid. Our isolates of Citrobacter diversus were resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin and sensitive to cephalothin. Citrobacter diversus should be distinguished from Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This organism joins Streptococcus pyogenes, bacteroids species, anaerobic streptococci and Escherichia coli as a cause of slight pneumonia with extensive empyema.
TI  - Interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  - Contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. Such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the STIC has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. Cultures of ENTEROBACTER, Klebsiella, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in the presence of human serum. The enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the STIC. Care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an STICassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. Serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.
TI  - The thrombocytolytic activity of bacterial peptidoglycans.
AB  - The peptidoglycan of group A Streptococcus prepared by hot formamide or TCA extraction has an expressive ability to lyse rabbit blood platelets in vitro. Initial changes in the ultrastructure of platelets can be observed after 10 minutes incubation of rabbit platelets with 0.1 mug of Streptococcus peptidoglycan per ml. The submicroscopic alterations are characterized by changes of the shape and damage of the limiting membrane of the platelets. Larger amounts of peptidoglycan (10 mug/ml and more) cause total destruction of platelets; only remainders of the limiting membrane and free granulomers can be seen. Peptidoglycans of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus exhibit a comparable effect on rabbit platelets. There are substantial differences in the sensitivity of blood platelets of different animal species to the streptococcal peptidoglycan. Rat platelets exhibit a similar thrombocytolytic effect after the Streptococcus peptidoglycan treatment as rabbit ones; however, the development of comparable changes in their submicroscopic structure needs a dose of peptidoglycan 10(2)-10(3) times higher. Platelets of guinea-pig, dog, cat, calf and human appear to be quite resistant under analogous conditions to as such a high dose of Streptococcus peptidoglycan as 500 mug/ml.
TI  - Endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. The pyrogenic response of rabbit to group A streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or TCA is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. The pyrogenicity can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of the material by lysozyme. Peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group B and L streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group A streptococcus peptidoglycan. Spirillum serpens and Escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. Repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. Cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. Rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to S. aureus and group A streptococcus peptidoglycans. Intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages of the degenerative and necrotic process. Local Shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. The results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. Non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. These properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. The data presented suggest the role of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.
TI  - Comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  - Two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, Prepodyne and Betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. A standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. Complete cidal activty was exhibited by both Prepodyne and Betadine. Twenty-five subjects were tested in hand washing experiments using Betadine and Prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. Quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. Betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; Prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. It can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.
TI  - Bacteriologic flora of aspiration-induced pulmonary infections.
AB  - The role of anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms in the genesis of pneumonia or lung abscess in patients with historical, clinical, and radiologic findings suggestive of aspiration was compared to their role in similar patients without these findings. Bacterial specimens were obtained by transtracheal aspiration or thoracentesis. Anaerobes were isolated in 100% of the patients who were aspiration-prone as contrasted with only 20% of those who were not. Isolation of a single species or no growth was more common in the nonaspiration group, whereas multiple isolates were more common in the aspiration group. Patients with lung abscesses were treated with penicillin and all of them responded clinically, despite occasional recovery from the culture specimen of penicillin-resistant organisms. This suggests that lung abscess may be the result of a synergistic bacterial infection.

TI  - In vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
AB  - Sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by Micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. Sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. It was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. Most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of clindamycin and other antimicrobials against gram-positive bacteria and Hemophilus influenzae.
AB  - SUMMARY: Seven antimicrobials--clindamycin, penicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin,  erythromycin, lincomycin and cephalexin--were found to have a high degree of activity in vitro against 256 isolates of gram-positive bacteria and Hemophilus influenzae. Clindamycin was clearly superior against staphylococci and 3.12 mug/ml or less of clindamycin inhibited all 35 isolates of H. influenzae. Synergism was not demonstrated when clindamycin was tested in combination with sulfisoxazole or sulfamethoxazole by either the agar dilution or 24-hour growth curve method. This was true for penicillin as well, and the effect was independent of sulfonamide sensitivity. The erythromycin-sulfonamide combination was synergistic against 6 of 10 strains studied by the growth curve method; this effect was not demonstrable by the agar dilution method.
TI  - In vitro bacteriological study of a new antibiotic substance: sisomicin.
AB  - Effects of a new antimicrobial agent sisomicin on microorganisms isolated from pathologic material (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes-B, Citrobacter Freundii) were studied. The results obtained were compared with another two aminoglycoside antibiotics - gentamicin and tobramycin. All three antibiotics were found to be very effective in vitro; their effect was enhanced by addition of an antibiotic of the penicillin group (carbenicillin, suncillin) or an antibiotic of the tetracyklin series (oxytetracyklin, doxycyklin). All three preparations were tested on 26 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Tobramycin inhibited growth of 22 strains and thus presented the highest level of efficiency among these deoxystreptamin preparations.
TI  - Doxycycline in respiratory tract infections. A review of a multi-centre trial.
AB  - A total of 256 patients were admitted in Germany into a Pan-European multi centre trial of doxycycline in the treatment of infections of the respiratory tract. The diagnoses showed a preponderance of lower respiratory tract infections compared with other European countries, due largely to the fact that the participating physicians were pulmonary or internal medicine specialists. Doxycycline was given in a dose of 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg daily for 5-10 days (only the occasional patient varied from this regimen). Side-effects were uncommon (2.5-3.5%) and affected only the gastrointestinal tract. Four patients had to change antibiotic therapy, not because of side-effects but because of possible bacterial resistance in these patients. The results were comparable with those from the rest of Europe: 88% of patients had a good or very good response. Nine patients were treated for longer than 14 days and only eight patients did not show improvement.
TI  - Activity of doxycycline against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - 149 patients were admitted from the Brussels area to the multi-centre Pan European trial of doxycycline in respiratory tract infections. Of these, 40 satisfied the strict criteria for detailed bacteriological study with positive culture of a known pathogen before treatment and bacteriological follow-up after treatment. The pathogens were beta-haemolytic streptococcus, group A (29 cases), pneumococcus (6 cases) and Haemophilus influenzae (6 cases); in one case, the pneumococcus and H. influenzae were present together. The results of doxycycline therapy were excellent, this included both its in vivo and in vitro activity; only one strain of pneumococcus proved resistant.
TI  - The bacteriological ecosystem of the skin of children in an African tropical envirovment (Tanzania).
AB  - Using a standardized method for sampling, the aerobic microbial flora of the skin of ninety-five children in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was studied qualitatively and quantitatively. The subjects comprised three groups; group A, thirty-seven normal infants (below the age of 1 year); group B, twenty-nine infants with various bacterial skin lesions; and group C, twenty-nine nursery school children between 4-5 and 7 years. The following observations were made: (I) The quantitative results indicated; (a) great variation between individuals, which was more marked among the females; (b) lower bacterial counts in infants than in older children; (c) counts were not affected by the presence of infection or state of cleanliness; (d) there were some differences between females and males and between different ethnic groups. (2) Qualitatively, the types of organisms isolated were similar to those reported elsewhere. There were differences in carrier rates of many organisms but these were most striking with Staphylococcus aureus and Staph. albus. It is concluded that there are great differences in carrier rates between persons in a tropical African environment and those studied elsewhere. These difference may be due to environmental, geographical or ethnic factors. Such observations call for more studies in this area to establish the normal flora.
TI  - Isolation of two new related peptide antibiotics, cerexins A and B (studies on antibiotics from the genus Bacillus. I).
AB  - Two new antibiotics cerexins A and B were isolated from different strains identified with Bacillus cereus. These two antibiotics are amphoteric in nature, soluble in particular solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide and alkaline water, and show typical infrared absorptions of peptide. These also have similar antimicrobial properties active against gram-postive bacteria.
TI  - Interaction of clindamycin and gentamicin in vitro.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gentamicin alone and in  combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic clinical isolates. All 77 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and anaerobic bacteria (except for three strains of Clostridium) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of clindamycin per ml. Gentamicin did not interfere with the activity of clindamycin within the range of concentrations tested (0.1 to 100 mug/ml); for some strains combinations were synergistic. Sixty-two (94%) of 66 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of gentamicin per ml. Combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains. All 20 strains of enterococcus, three strains of Clostridium, three strains of Escherichia coli, and one strain of Proteus rettgeri were resistant to both clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml) and gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml). Combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains. Except for clindamycin-sensitive isolates, synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo. Antagonism was never observed.

TI  - Sensitivity of Streptococcus pyogenes to sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and cotrimoxazole.
AB  - When tested on Wellcotest (sensitivity test agar, Wellcome) supplemented with lysed horse blood, 59 clinical isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci, belonging to several serological groups, are all sensitive to sulphamethoxazole, to trimethoprim, and to cotrimoxazole. The results obtained on diagnostic sensitivity test agar (Oxoid) containing lysed horse blood are comparable. When Mueller Hinton agar (Difco) is used, some of these strains are called resistant: this is especially true in the case of sulphamethoxazole.Furthermore, on Mueller Hinton agar, even supplemented with lysed blood, discrepancies between diameters of inhibition zone and MIC values exist for the three drugs tested, strains with a low MIC being considered resistant by the disc method. Such disagreements are not observed with non-streptococcal control strains.

TI  - New antimicrobial nitrofuran, trans-5-amino-3-[2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-delta2-1,2,4-oxadiazole: antimicrobial efficacy in mice, rats, and guinea pigs.
AB  - A new antimicrobial nitrofuran designated SQ 18,506 showed some therapeutic activity when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Shigella flexneri, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Animals infected parenterally with Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Candida albicans, or topically with Trichophyton mentagrophytes, did not respond to therapy with the drug at the dosage levels used. The compound was as effective as metronidazole in the topical treatment of experimental trichomonal infections in mice and in guinea pigs and as effective as nystatin, candicidin, or a sulfanilamide-aminacrine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of a candidal vaginal infection in rats. The chemotherapeutic efficacy of SQ 18,506 in experimental vaginitis caused by Escherichia coli in the rat surpassed that shown by four commercial products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginitis.

AB  - A small phenolic compound, gamma-L-glutamyl-4-hydroxybenzene, and several quinoid derivatives appear in the gill tissues of the mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, during the prodromal period of sporulation. These quinoids markedly inhibit respiratory enzymes and protein synthesis. The temporal relationship of their appearance to sporulaton and their properties as metabolic inhibitors indicate that they initiate and maintain the dormant or cryptobiotic state of the spore. In very low concentrations, these quinoids show significant bacteriocidal action against a variety of microorganisms. The therapeutic potential of these antibiotic properties is considered.

TI  - Inhibition of bacterial growth by beta-chloro-D-alanine.
AB  - The D- and L-isomers of beta-chloroalanine inhibit the growth of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. With pneumococcus the inhibition by beta-chloro-D-alanine is completely prevented by either D-alanine or D-alanyl-D-alanine, while L-alanine is not effective in preventing the inhibition. The inhibition of growth by beta-chloro-L-alanine is not affected by D-alanine and is only partially prevented by high concentrations of L-alanine. The intracellular free alanine in untreated E. coli and B. subtilis is about 95% in the D-configuration while the free intracellular alanine in both organisms after treatment with beta-chloro-D-alanine is predominantly the L-isomer. These results suggested that the beta-chloroamino acid inactivates alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1). Indeed, when extracts of E. coli or B. subtilis were treated with beta-chloro-D-alanine, the activities of alanine racemase and of D-glutamate-D-alanine transaminase were found to be 90-95% inhibited. Studies with mice have shown that beta-chloro-D-alanine is an effective antibacterial agent in vivo againt D. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and E. coli.

AB  - The in vitro activity of tobramycin was studied against 457 clinical isolates of  gram-negative bacilli and 151 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci. The vast majority of the gram-negative bacilli was inhibited by tobramycin at a concentration of 1.56 mug or less per ml. Only a few isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and no isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes or Diplococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to this drug. Tobramycin was generally more active than gentamicin sulfate against gram-negative bacilli, although organisms resistant to gentamicin sulfate were also resistant to tobramycin. The major difference between the two drugs was the greater activity of tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The protective effect was almost similar to that afforded by several known macrolide antibiotics in mice infected intraperitoneally with certain strains of the gram-positive species described above. The skin lesion caused by intradermal challenge of S. aureus in mice also responded very effectively to treatment with 9-propionylmaridomycin.

TI  - Abolition of swarming of Proteus by p-nitrophenyl glycerin: application to blood  agar media.
AB  - Comparative plate counts were made of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes growing on blood agar supplemented with individual chemicals to abolish the swarming of Proteus. B-phenylethanol, sodium azide, and p-nitrophenyl glycerin (PNPG) were used as anti-swarm agents. Each anti-swarm agent effectively abolished swarming for 24 h, but azide failed to control swarming for longer periods of incubation. In addition, azide displayed growth inhibition towards the staphylococci and streptococci resulting in no hemolysis and reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci. Phenylethanol showed reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci and unreliable hemolytic reactions. At 0.1 to 0.3 mM, PNPG proved to be a superior anti-swarm agent in that it showed no growth inhibition and allowed normal hemolysis, but abolished swarming for extended periods of time. When laboratory strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae were screened on a blood agar medium containing 0.1 mm PNPG, they displayed similar growth and hemolytic characteristics to the identical medium without PNPG.
TI  - Immunoglobulins of the middle ear fluid in acute otitis media: relationship to serum immunoglobulin concentrations and bacterial cultures.
AB  - Immunoglobulin concentrations were studied in 255 specimens of middle ear fluid (MEF) from 165 episodes of acute otitis media in children. There were significant amounts of all three major immunoglobulins (Ig) in MEF, the mean concentration of IgA being 39 mg/100 ml, of IgM 63 mg/100 ml, and of IgG 383 mg/100 ml. Secretory component was present in all 10 MEF specimens in which it was sought. In patients over 9 months of age, there was a decreased likelihood of isolating pathogenic bacteria from MEF if the patient had higher concentrations of IgA in MEF than in simultaneously obtained serum. IgA concentrations were greater in MEF than in serum in almost half the patients, and the mean MEF-serum ratio for IgA was 1.38. Thus, it would appear that in this disorder MEF represents primarily a secretory response to inflammation rather than a transudate.
TI  - Effect of osmotic stabilizers on 14 CO 2 production by bacteria and blood.
AB  - Evolution of (14)CO(2) by whole blood as well as by Diplococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas diminuta, and Streptococcus pyogenes was examined by using the BACTEC system. The control medium was JLI no. 6A culture vial containing 30 ml of enriched tryptic soy broth and 1.5 muCi of (14)C-substrate. Hypertonic media consisted of control medium with either 1 or 3% NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 5%, 10%, or 15% dextran. The most deleterious treatment to bacteria was 3% NaCl since it not only retarded (14)CO(2) production, but also prevented growth of D. pneumoniae, Haemophilus, and P. diminuta. The 10% sucrose treatment diminished (14)CO(2) output, although it did not retard growth of test organisms. This effect was probably due to (14)C-substrate dilution rather than to osmotic effects. Dextran had slight effect on (14)CO(2) production and slightly acidified the medium. Of the treatments tested, only 10% sucrose reduced normal output of (14)CO(2) by whole blood. This also is probably due to (14)C-substrate dilution. It appears that 10% sucrose is potentially the most useful osmotic agent for radiometric techniques since, although bacterial (14)CO(2) production is lowered, blood (14)CO(2) is lowered also.

AB  - BL-S 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature of the assay medium. When assayed in nutrient agar, BL-S 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus sp. However, when assayed in Mueller-Hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. The in vivo activity of BL-S 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. When BL-S 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. BL-S 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. Recovery of BL-S 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

AB  - Overnight cultures of V. cholerae, V. el tor, non-cholera vibrio, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in tryptone-soya broth (with 5% blood added for the last-named) failed to grow on subculture despite visible growth in all tubes. Viable counts and pH determinations of overnight cultures of various species in tryptone-soya broth, brain-heart infusion broth, and Lab-Lemco peptone broth show that death in tryptone-soya broth is associated with the drop in pH resulting from fermentation of glucose in the medium and that this drop is greater than that produced by the same amount of glucose in brain-heart infusion broth. Some strains of pneumococci failed to grow in brain-heart infusion broth and it is suggested that both these media are unsuitable for blood cultures.

AB  - 7-[alpha-(1-Methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as BL-S 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. A comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that BL-S 217 is about eightfold more effective against Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BL-S 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., BL-S 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against Salmonella and Enterobacter. Overall, of 208 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to BL-S 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. BL-S 217 was less bound to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. The LD(50) of BL-S 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. When administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in S. pyogenes and D. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an E. coli infection. Its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.

TI  - Platelet interaction with bacteria. I. Reaction phases and effects of inhibitors.
AB  - Interactions between human platelets and several common species of bacteria have  been studied in vitro by the technic of recording nephelometry. Results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) Bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) The platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) The degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) Direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) By adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with Staphylococcus being the most powerful.

TI  - Epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  - Epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

AB  - More than 500 bacteria isolated from patient material were tested against carbenicillin (disodium alpha-carboxybenzylpenicillin) by diffusion and dilution modalities. The same bacteria, which included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Aerobacter-Enterobacter group, various species of Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus and epiddermidis, enterococci, pneumococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, etc., were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics commonly used with special emphasis on ampicillin and cephalothin. The responses of pyocine-typed P. aeruginosa were the most remarkable. The majority of these bacteria displayed susceptibility to carbenicillin by both the dilution and the diffusion techniques. The concentrations of this antibiotic used in the laboratory were of the same order of magnitude as that of the other drugs. The laboratory behavior of the other bacteria, toward this new semisynthetic penicillin derivative approximated their response to ampicillin and cephalothin.

TI  - Antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  - A series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. Although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In other comparative laboratory tests against P. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. An examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. The compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. Results of studies with a cell-free P. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for P. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. Some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.
TI  - Combined effects of diphenyliodonium chloride, pine oils, and mustard oil soaps on certain microorganisms.
AB  - Bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities of an emulsion containing 10.0% (v/v)  terpineol, 0.5% (w/v) diphenyliodonium chloride, 11.0% (v/v) ethyl alcohol, and 5.62% saponified mustard oil were tested against a number of different types of organisms. The bactericidal concentration for Salmonella typhosa was 1:400. In the presence of 5.0% horse serum, it increased to 1:250. The bacteriostatic concentration varied from organism to organism; Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus required 4,000 mug/ml for complete bacteriostasis, whereas Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Salmonella paratyphi-A, and Shigella required only 2,000 mug/ml for complete inhibition. A 4.0% concentration of the emulsion killed the spores of Bacillus subtilis within 6 hr.

TI  - Microbiological and pharmacological behavior of 7-chlorolincomycin.
AB  - Replacement of the 7-(R) hydroxyl group of lincomycin by a 7-chloro-substituent produced a compound with greater in vitro activity than the parent. Laboratory studies of this compound showed it to be highly active against all of the following strains of gram-positive organisms examined, including penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. The enterococci, as well as all the gram-negative organisms tested, with the exception of some strains of Haemophilus, were uniformly insensitive to this agent. The activity of 7-chlorolincomycin was not affected by serum or inoculum size. Resistance developed in a slow stepwise pattern. Peak levels of approximately 2 mug/ml were achieved in the serum of volunteers after ingestion of 150 mg either in the fasting state or after a meal. No untoward effects were noted. The antibiotic appears to be of potential value in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive organisms, with the exception of enterococcus.

AB  - Concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. The in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. All strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all S. aureus, 80% of Escherichia coli, 72% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter, and 56% of Proteus mirabilis strains. About 90 to 96% of E. coli, Klebsiella Aerobacter, and P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. A peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. A mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. Food did not interfere with absorption. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. The mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group A streptococci, D. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, 85% of E. coli, and about 40 to 75% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter and P. mirabilis strains. Levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of E. coli, and P. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter strains.
TI  - Demonstration of a bactericidal substance against beta-hemolytic streptococci in  supernatant fluids of staphylococcal cultures.
AB  - Staphylococcal skin isolates belonging to phage type 71 were found to produce a bactericidal substance against some streptococci, pneumococci, and corynebacteria. Fifteen strains of group A streptococci belonging to 13 different M types, group C streptococci, and group D streptococci were uniformly inhibited on solid media and in broth by membrane-filtered supernatant fluids of the staphylococcal broth cultures. Inhibition of group G streptococci and other staphyloccoci was variable, and no inhibition of group B streptococci or of a variety of gram-negative rods was demonstrable. A quantitative variation observed to exist among susceptible organisms was a function of the inoculum size of the inhibited strains. The bactericidal substance could be detected best from 24 to 48 hr after inoculation of the staphylococci in tryptic soy broth or in a dialysate of tryptic soy broth. Little or no bactericidal activity was noted when the organisms were grown in several other liquid media. The bactericidal substance was nondialyzable and could be precipitated with ammonium sulfate. It was heat-stable and its activity was not altered within a pH range of 4.0 to 8.5. Pronase and three times crystallized trypsin totally abolished its activity. The concentrated ammonium sulfate precipitate could be fractionated on a Sephadex G-100 column into several peaks, with the bactericidal activity localized to a single peak.

TI  - Effects of indomethacin on acute, subacute, and latent infections in mice and rats.
AB  - The comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. Large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae AD, Salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Streptococcus pyogenes C203, Salmonella pullorum #2, Proteus vulgaris 1810, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. In contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. In a more chronic bacterial infection due to Corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. Indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. Hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial infection. Insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  - Serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. The in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. All strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Eighty per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Klebsiella-Aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. When single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. A full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. The peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group A streptococci and D. pneumoniae. Many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. mirabilis. Urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the E. coli and P. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of Klebsiella-Aerobacter.
TI  - Biological characterization of prasinomycin, a phosphorus-containing antibiotic.
AB  - Prasinomycin, a new antibiotic from the green spore streptomycete, Streptomyces prasinus, primarily inhibits the growth of gram-positive microorganisms. Like penicillin, it is effective only against growing cells. Though primarily bacteriostatic at levels about the minimal inhibitory concentration, it is bactericidal at higher levels. Neither synergism nor antagonism could be demonstrated for prasinomycin with a variety of other antibiotics. It is highly active upon subcutaneous administration to mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes C203, or Diplococcus pneumoniae. Prasinomycin has a unique prophylactic action whereby one dose protects mice against experimental infections for as long as 2 months. It is more effective against S. aureus infections in mice when administered subcutaneously 20 hr prior to infection than when given in divided doses 1 hr before and 4 hr after infection.

One bacterium, a pseudomonad, has been given the name Pseudomonas bromoutilis because of its distinctive capability. The antibiotic has been extracted, purified, and obtained in crystal form, and its structure has been determined. Although clinical tests of its properties were not encouraging, it may be of significant value and interest from an ecological standpoint.

Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
TI  - Pharmacology and chemotherapy of ampicillin--a new broad-spectrum penicillin.
AB  - The pharmacology and chemotherapy of a new penicillin, 6[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido] penicillanic acid, are described. It is non-toxic, is absorbed orally and is distributed throughout the body in a manner similar to other penicillins. It is eliminated unchanged from the body in high concentrations in the bile and urine. Almost all of the antibiotic can be accounted for in the urine and intestinal contents 2 hr after intramuscular administration but not after oral administration. It is concluded that the antibiotic is not metabolized within the body. Studies with infected animals show that it is as effective as the existing oral penicillins against Staphylococcus pyogenes Smith (penicillin sensitive), Streptococcus pyogenes Group A and Diplococcus pneumoniae. It is ineffective against penicillin-resistant Staphylococci. When tested in mice infected with the gram-negative organisms, Salmonella tryphimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, it was considerably more active than tetracycline and chloramphenicol.

TI  - The binding of penicillin in relation to its cytotoxic action. III. The binding of penicillin by mammalian cells in tissue culture (HeLa and L strains).
AB  - 1. (a) Mammalian cells in tissue culture (mouse fibroblasts and malignant human uterine epithelium) did not concentrate penicillin from the culture medium. Even at low concentrations, the cellular accumulation was usually less than that in the surrounding fluid, and most of it was removed by washing. The radioactive material in such eluates was actively bactericidal, and was presumably in large part unchanged penicillin. (b) Penicilloic acid, produced by the action of penicillinase, was bound to the same (limited) extent as the active antibiotic. In both these respects mammalian cells behaved like naturally penicillin-resistant bacteria, and unlike such penicillin-sensitive bacteria as Streptococcus pyogenes or Diplococcus pneumoniae. 2. Cell-free sonic extracts of the L strain had the same limited reactivity with penicillin as the intact cells. The relatively minute amounts bound by the cells are therefore not due to their impermeability, but instead reflect the inherently low reactivity of the cellular constituents with penicillin. 3. It is suggested that the relative non-toxicity of penicillin for the mammalian host, and for mammalian cells in tissue culture, may be related to this low order of reactivity with the antibiotic.
TI  - The binding of penicillin in relation to its cytotoxic action. II. The reactivity with penicillin of resistant variants of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci.
AB  - 1. In a previous study, the differing sensitivity of bacterial strains as they occur in nature appeared to be correlated with their correspondingly differing reactivity with penicillin. Presumably, the over-all reactivity of the cell with penicillin paralleled that of the vulnerable cell component(s). However, when penicillin-resistant variants of these strains (Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus pyogenes, Diplococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus faecalis) were produced by serial passage through increasing concentrations of antibiotic, this correlation between resistance and the ability of the cell to bind penicillin was no longer apparent. Some resistant variants bound more penicillin than the parent, sensitive cell (Streptococcus faecalis, Micrococcus pyogenes), some were unchanged in their reactivity (Diplococcus pneumoniae, Micrococcus pyogenes), and some bound less (Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus pyogenes). One resistant variant of Micrococcus pyogenes at first showed enhanced reactivity with penicillin; on continued passage through antibiotic, there was a further increase in resistance, but now associated with a significantly decreased reactivity. In the case of Diplococcus pneumoniae, a resistant variant at first reacted normally with penicillin; on continued passage in antibiotic, its binding affinity for penicillin gradually decreased, but with no associated further increase in resistance. 2. The reactivity with penicillin of cell-free sonic extracts of the resistant variants paralleled that of the intact organisms. Permeability considerations therefore did not seem involved in the increased resistance produced by serial passage in antibiotic. 3. The penicillin-resistant variants did not have an enhanced capacity to degrade the free intracellular antibiotic. 4. Possible alternative explanations are discussed in the text.

The total curative doses (CD(50)) of penicillins F, G, K, and X in pneumococcal infections of white mice (ten injections at 3 hour intervals) were 4.6, 3.8, 20, and 2.4 mg. per kg., respectively, or relative activities of 83, 100, 19, and 160, referred to G as 100. 3. The corresponding curative doses in streptococcal infections of white mice were 2.6, 1.3, 14.0, and 0.5 mg. per kg., or relative activities of 50, 100, 9, and 260. 4. Penicillin K was therefore one-tenth as active in vivo as would be implied by its bactericidal activity in vitro. This probably reflects its rapid inactivation in vivo, evidenced by the low and evanescent blood levels observed in both rabbits and man, and the low urinary recovery of this species of penicillin. 5. Penicillin X was significantly more active therapeutically than its bactericidal activity in vitro would imply. This probably reflects its slower inactivation in vivo, evidenced by the somewhat higher and more prolonged blood levels afforded by this penicillin in comparison with penicillin G. Judged by the mouse infections with the strains here used, penicillin X is the penicillin of choice in the treatment of infections with pneumococcus Type I and hemolytic streptococci. 6. The curative dose of penicillin in streptococcal and pneumococcal infections paralleled the varying susceptibility of these organisms to penicillin in vitro.
