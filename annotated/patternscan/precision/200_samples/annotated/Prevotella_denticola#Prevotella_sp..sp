TI == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels. the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or 38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

TI == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials, antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

TI == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI == reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB == objective: salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. salivary arginase activity (saa) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the saa before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. method and materials: eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. salivary total protein level and saa were also established by spectrophotometry. clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the wilcoxon, mann-withney, and kruskal-wallis tests (p < .05). for microbial data, the chi-square test was used. the pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. results: after therapy, due to a significant reduction in saa, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found in the healthy group. interestingly, after therapy, saa followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group t forsythia, pre- > posttherapy; periodontitis group p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). conclusion: based on the reduction of saa after therapy, in accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters, it was concluded that saa has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

TI == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI == pattern of distribution of prevotella species/phylotypes associated with healthy  gingiva and periodontal disease.
AB == the purpose of the present study was to obtain diverse profiles of prevotella species associated with gingival sites in an isolated aboriginal and an urban community by phylogenetic analysis and to establish patterns of association of identified prevotella species in gingival sites. species/phylotypes identified from the phylogenetic analysis of near full-length bacteroidetes 16s rrna gene sequences cloned from subgingival plaque samples obtained from an aboriginal community were compared with those from an ethnically diverse urban metropolitan population suffering from periodontal disease. specific primer sets were designed and validated for 22 distinct prevotella species from the 24 species/phylotypes identified from both populations. within the isolated aboriginal community, gingival sites in adults were colonised by a mean of 15 different prevotella species. prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, prevotella denticola and prevotella sp. strain p4p62 had the highest association with increasing probing depth in diseased sites (p < 0.05). p. intermedia and prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, the prevotella species significantly associated with increasing probing depth in diseased gingival sites and also strongly associated with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed significant correlation for co-colonisation (r = 0.6). prevotella sp. oral clone b31fd, showing strong association with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed no significant correlation for co-colonisation with any other prevotella species. this study provides a comprehensive analysis of prevotella species associated with gingival sites for the informative evaluation of the epidemiology of infection by this genus.

AB == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00) and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens. the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

AB == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI == molecular identification of bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from children with cystic fibrosis.
AB == culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) is the gold standard for detection of pathogens in the lower airways in cystic fibrosis (cf). however, current culture results do not explain all clinical observations in cf, including negative culture results during pulmonary exacerbation and inflammation in the absence of pathogens. we hypothesize that organisms not routinely identified by culture occur in the cf airway and may contribute to disease. to test this hypothesis we used a culture-independent molecular approach, based on use of rrna sequence analysis, to assess the bacterial composition of balf from children with cf and disease controls (dc). specimens from 42 subjects (28 cf) were examined, and approximately 6,600 total clones were screened to identify 121 species of bacteria. in general, a single rrna type dominated clone libraries from cf specimens, but not dc. thirteen cf subjects contained bacteria that are not routinely assessed by culture. in four cf subjects, candidate pathogens were identified and include the anaerobe prevotella denticola, a lysobacter sp., and members of the rickettsiales. the presumptive pathogens tropheryma whipplei and granulicatella elegans were identified in cases from the dc group. the presence of unexpected bacteria in cf may explain inflammation without documented pathogens and consequent failure to respond to standard treatment. these results show that molecular techniques provide a broader perspective on airway bacteria than do routine clinical cultures and thus can identify targets for further clinical evaluation.

TI == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph. endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic infections associated with clinical symptoms.

AB == four bacterial strains isolated from the human oral cavity, pppa19, pppa21(t), pppa28 and pppa30, were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles and the phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of the isolates was a member of the genus prevotella. these strains were related to prevotella denticola with about 95 % similarity. the strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. however, the cells of these strains were often cocci (coccobacilli), depending on the cultivation time. colonies of different sizes were detected on eggerth gagnon agar plates for these strains. the cells forming large colonies were cocci, whereas those forming small colonies were cocci and rods. however, 16s rrna gene sequence comparison of colonies of different sizes revealed that only a single organism was present. although these strains had phenotypic characteristics that were similar to those of p. denticola jcm 8528, they could be differentiated from p. denticola jcm 8528 by aesculin hydrolysis and d-cellobiose fermentation in api 20a tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinction of these four strains with respect to p. denticola jcm 8528. on the basis of these data, a novel prevotella species, prevotella multiformis sp. nov., is proposed, with pppa21(t) (=jcm 12541(t)=dsm 16608(t)) as the type strain.
