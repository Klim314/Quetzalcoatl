TI  - Peripheral blood neutrophil cytokine hyper-reactivity in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Pro-inflammatory cytokine release (IL-8, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) by peripheral blood neutrophils, isolated from periodontitis patients (before/after therapy) and matched controls, was determined after 18 h culture in the presence/absence of Escherichia coli LPS, opsonised Staphylococcus aureus, heat-killed Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All cultures demonstrated differences in the amounts of each cytokine detected (P < 0.0001), with a clear release pattern (IL-8 > IL-6 > TNF-alpha = IL-1beta). Median cytokine release from unstimulated patient neutrophils was consistently, but non-significantly, higher than from control cells. Stimulated cytokine release from untreated patient neutrophils was also consistently higher than from control cells. This hyper-reactivity was significant for all tested cytokines when data for all stimuli were combined (P < 0.016). In terms of individual stimuli, significant hyper-reactivity was detected with LPS (IL-8), F. nucleatum (IL-8, TNF-alpha), opsonised S. aureus (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) and P. gingivalis (IL-8, IL-1beta). Cytokine production by patient neutrophils did not reduce following successful non-surgical periodontal therapy and, except for responses to F. nucleatum, the cytokine hyper-reactivity detected pre-therapy was retained. These data demonstrate that chronic periodontitis is characterised by neutrophils that constitutively exhibit cytokine hyper-reactivity, the effects of which could modulate local and systemic inflammatory-immune responses and influence the risk and severity of periodontitis-associated systemic inflammatory diseases.
TI  - Intragingival injection of Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide induces a transient increase in gingival tumour necrosis factor-alpha, but not interleukin-6, in anaesthetised rats.
AB  - This study used in vivo microdialysis to examine the effects of intragingival application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg-LPS) on gingival tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in rats. A microdialysis probe with an injection needle attached to the surface of the dialysis membrane was implanted into the gingiva of the upper incisor. For comparison, the effects of LPS derived from Escherichia coli (Ec-LPS) on IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were also analysed. Pg-LPS (1 mug/1 muL) or Ec-LPS (1 or 6 mug/1 muL) was applied by microsyringe, with gingival dialysates collected every hour. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that gingival dialysates contained approximately 389 pg.mL-1 of IL-6 basally; basal TNF-alpha levels were lower than the detection limit of the ELISA. Pg-LPS failed to alter IL-6 levels but markedly increased TNF-alpha levels, which remained elevated for 2 h after treatment. Neither IL-6 nor TNF-alpha were affected by Ec-LPS. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the gingiva expresses Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 mRNA. Immunohistochemical examination showed that TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed by gingival epithelial cells. The present study provides in vivo evidence that locally applied Pg-LPS, but not Ec-LPS, into the gingiva transiently increases gingival TNF-alpha without affecting IL-6. The present results suggest that TLR2 but not TLR4 expressed on gingival epithelial cells may mediate the Pg-LPS-induced increase in gingival TNF-alpha in rats.International Journal of Oral Science advance online publication, 5 June 2015; doi:10.1038/ijos.2015.9.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - Resistance of MMP9 and TIMP1 to endotoxin tolerance.
AB  - Inflammatory cytokines activate tissue collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs are antagonized by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) that attempt to regulate excessive collagenase activity during inflammatory conditions. During chronic inflammatory conditions, induction of endotoxin tolerance negatively regulates the cytokine response in an attempt to curtail excessive host tissue damage. However, little is known about how downregulation of inflammatory cytokines during endotoxin tolerance regulates MMP activities. In this study, human monocyte-derived macrophages were either sensitized or further challenged to induce tolerance with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PgLPS) or Escherichia coli (EcLPS). Inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and levels of MMP9 and TIMP1 were analyzed by a combination of cytometric bead array, western blot/gelatin zymography and real-time RT-PCR. Functional blocking with anti-TLR4 but not with anti-TLR2 significantly downregulated TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. However, MMP9 levels were not inhibited by toll-like receptor (TLR) blocking. Interestingly, endotoxin tolerance significantly upregulated TIMP1 relative to MMP9 and downmodulated MMP9 secretion and its enzymatic activity. These results suggest that regulatory mechanisms such as induction of endotoxin tolerance could inhibit MMP activities and could facilitate restoring host tissue homeostasis.
TI  - Protonography, a powerful tool for analyzing the activity and the oligomeric state of the gamma-carbonic anhydrase identified in the genome of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes, mostly containing zinc  within their active site, which catalyze a simple but physiologically relevant reaction in all life kingdoms, carbon dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and protons. Six CA classes (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, zeta and eta) and multiple CA isoforms evolved in organisms all over the phylogenetic tree, for facing the need to efficiently convert high amounts of CO2 to its hydration products. These enzymes are thus involved in many physiologic processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, CO2 transport, electrolyte secretion in many tissues/organs; biosynthetic reactions (gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, ureagenesis), etc. Recently, our group reported a new technique to assay CA activity on SDS-PAGE gels, named 'protonography' due to its similarity to zymography. By using protonography, the conversion of CO2 into protons can be visualized as a yellow band on a polyacrylamide gel. By using this technique we demonstrated the possibility to detect activity of the alpha-CA from Vibrio cholerae as well as the beta- and gamma-CAs present in Escherichia coli extracts. Furthermore, the activity of the newly discovered eta-class enzyme from Plasmodium falciparum has also been evidenced with protonography, illustrating its wide use. Here we show that protonography can be also useful to reveal the oligomeric state of the gamma-CA identified in the genome of the bacterial parasite colonizing the oral cavity, Porphyromonas gingivalis, possibly allowing for a simple and efficient diagnostic method.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of extracts and metabolites of Robinia pseudoacacia L. on Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis causing dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases.
AB  - The mouth cavity hosts many types of anaerobic bacteria, including Streptococcus  mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, which cause periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of extracts of Robinia pseudoacacia and its different fractions, as well as some of its natural compounds against oral pathogens and a nonpathogenic reference bacteria, Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of the crude extract and the solvent fractions (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol) of R. pseudoacacia were evaluated against S. mutans, P. gingivalis and E. coli DH5alpha by standard micro-assay procedure using conventional sterile polystyrene microplates. The results showed that the crude extract was more active against P. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) than against S. mutans (73% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/mL. The chloroform and hexane fractions were active against P. gingivalis, with 91 and 97% growth inhibition, respectively, at 0.2 mg/mL. None of seven natural compounds found in R. pseudoacacia exerted an antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis; however, fisetin and myricetin at 8 microg/mL inhibited the growth of S. mutans by 81% and 86%, respectively. The crude extract of R. pseudoacacia possesses bioactive compounds that could completely control the growth of P. gingivalis. The antibiotic activities of the hexane and chloroform fractions suggest that the active compounds are hydrophobic in nature. The results indicate the effectiveness of the plant in clinical applications for the treatment of dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases and its potential use as disinfectant for various surgical and orthodontic appliances.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of dipeptidyl peptidase 11 from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase 11 from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PgDPP11) preferentially cleaves substrate peptides with Asp and Glu at the P1 position [NH2-P2-P1(Asp/Glu)-P1'-P2'...]. For crystallographic studies, PgDPP11 was overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data to 1.82 A resolution were collected from an orthorhombic crystal form belonging to space group C2221, with unit-cell parameters a = 99.33, b = 103.60, c = 177.33 A. Structural analysis by the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction method is in progress.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the C-terminal fragment of PorM, a subunit of the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion system.
AB  - PorM is a membrane protein involved in the assembly of the type IX secretion system (T9SS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major bacterial pathogen responsible for periodontal disease in humans. The periplasmic domain of PorM was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. A fragment of the purified protein was obtained by limited proteolysis. Crystals of this fragment belonged to the tetragonal space group P4(3)2(1)2. Native and MAD data sets were recorded to 2.85 and 3.1 A resolution, respectively, using synchrotron radiation.
TI  - Assessment of the effect of chemical agents used in dentistry on the removal of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli from sandblasted acid-etched titanium dental implants: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of chemicals to decontaminate Escherichia coli (E coli) or Porphyromonas gingivalis (P gingivalis) from sandblasted acid-etched (SAE) titanium dental implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SAE titanium dental implants were contaminated with E coli or P gingivalis and incubated in a sterile bacterial culture media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. The implants were treated with 10 different conditions: calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)(2)] paste for 1 minute and saline irrigation for 1 minute; Ca(OH)2 paste for 1 minute and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHXD) irrigation for 1 minute; 0.2% CHXD for 1 minute; Dakin's solution for 1 minute; tetracycline hydrochloride (T-HCl) as a 1 g per 20 mL solution for 1, 2, and 3 minutes; and T-HCl paste for 1, 2, and 3 minutes. All implants were irrigated with 1 mL of saline solution and incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 24 hours or 48 hours for E coli- and P gingivalis-contaminated implants, respectively. The control group was submitted to all procedures except for the chemical treatments. Aliquots were removed, and turbidity was measured by spectrophotometry. The level of bacterial growth in control cultures was considered to have a decontamination percentage (DC%) of 0. RESULTS: Spectrophotometric analysis showed that all chemical treatments resulted in significantly higher DC% compared to controls for SAE implants contaminated with E coli (P < .05) or P gingivalis (P < .05). For the P gingivalis experiments, SAE implants treated with Ca(OH)(2) paste and saline solution had a lower DC% (39.3%) than those in the other treatment groups. In the E coli experiments, DC% was significantly lower for SAE implants treated with Ca(OH)(2) paste and saline solution (48.7%), Dakin's solution (92.7%), or T-HCl paste for 1 minute (96.6%) than those in the other groups. CONCLUSION: The DC% of SAE implants contaminated with E coli or P gingivalis by means of chemicals commonly used in dentistry is high, with the exception of Ca(OH)(2) paste burnished for 1 minute and then irrigated with saline solution for 1 minute.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an anti-pseudomonal dichlorocarbazol derivative displaying anti-biofilm activity.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant towards all currently available antibiotics are increasingly encountered, raising the need for new anti-pseudomonal drugs. We therefore conducted a medium-throughput screen of a small-molecule collection resulting in the identification of the N-alkylated 3,6-dihalogenocarbazol 1-(sec-butylamino)-3-(3,6-dichloro-9H-carbazol-9-yl)propan-2-ol (MIC = 18.5 mug mL(-)(1)). This compound, compound 1, is bacteriostatic towards a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa. Importantly, 1 also eradicates mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa. 1 displays no cytotoxicity against various human cell types, pointing to its potential for further development as a novel antibacterial drug.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of PGLa-AM1, CPF-AM1, and magainin-AM1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (HDPs). Three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa-AM1), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AM1) and magainin-AM1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the African volcano frog Xenopus amieti (Pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. Minimal effective concentrations (MECs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by microbroth dilution. PGLa-AM1 and CPF-AM1 were particularly active against Streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. A type strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. PGLa-AM1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All three peptides showed less binding to P. gingivalis LPS than to LPS from the other species studied. Oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 muM peptide treatments. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 muM magainin-AM1 but not following treatment with PGLa-AM1 or CPF-AM1. In conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the X. amieti peptides bound to LPS from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. CPF-AM1 and PGLa-AM1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.
TI  - Characterization of tryptophanase from Vibrio cholerae.
AB  - Tryptophanase (Trpase) is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme responsible for the production of indole, an important intra- and interspecies signaling molecule in bacteria. In this study, the tnaA gene of Vibrio cholerae coding for VcTrpase was cloned into the pET-20b(+) vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) tn5:tnaA. Using Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) chromatography, VcTrpase was purified, and it possessed a molecular mass of approximately 49 kDa with specific absorption peaks at 330 and 435 nm and a specific activity of 3 U/mg protein. The VcTrpase had an 80 % homology to the Trpase of Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli, but only around 50 % identity to the Trpase of Proteus vulgaris and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The optimum conditions for the enzyme were at pH 9.0 and 45 degrees C. Recombinant VcTrpase exhibited analogous kinetic reactivity to the EcTrpase with K m and k cat values of 0.612 x 10(-3) M and 5.252 s(-1), respectively. The enzyme catalyzed S-methyl-L-cysteine and S-benzyl-L-cysteine degradation, but not L-phenylalanine and L-serine. Using a site-directed mutagenesis technique, eight residues (Thr52, Tyr74, Arg103, Asp137, Arg230, Lys269, Lys270, and His463) were conserved for maintaining enzyme catalysis. All amino acid substitutions at these sites either eliminated or remarkably diminished Trpase activity. These sites are thus potential targets for the design of drugs to control the V. cholerae Trpase and to further investigate its functions.
TI  - Irsogladine maleate inhibits Porphyromonas gingivalis-mediated expression of toll-like receptor 2 and interleukin-8 in human gingival epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is an infectious disease caused by an interaction between the host and periodontopathogenic bacteria. Regulating the immune response in human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) may contribute to the prevention of periodontitis. Irsogladine maleate (IM) has previously been shown to regulate inflammation and the cell-cell junctional barrier in HGEC. In addition to these functions, control of bacterial recognition is important for preventing inflammation in periodontal tissue. Innate immunity in gingival epithelium is the first line of defense and plays a crucial role against bacterial challenge. Therefore, the effect of IM on regulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is part of the innate immunity, was determined in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: OBA-9, an immortalized human gingival epithelial cell line, and primary cultured HGEC were used in this study. Real-time PCR and western blotting were performed in OBA-9 or HGEC stimulated with whole cells of Porphyromonas gingivalis or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from P. gingivalis (PgLPS) in the presence or absence of IM to determine expression of TLR2 mRNA and production of TLR2 protein. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against TLR2 was transfected into OBA-9 to clarify the association between the induction of TLR2 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production. RESULTS: The addition of IM into P. gingivalis or PgLPS-induced OBA-9 suppressed IL-8 production (p < 0.01). The addition of IM also abolished the induction of TLR2 by P. gingivalis or PgLPS in OBA-9 and primary cultured HGEC (p < 0.01). The suppressive effect of IM on the induction of TLR2 was also confirmed by immunohistostaining. Stimulation with peptidoglycan, a specific ligand for TLR2, suppressed the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA in the presence of IM (p < 0.01). However, LPS derived from Escherichia coli, a ligand for TLR4, did not induce the expression of TLR2 mRNA. The PgLPS-induced expression of TLR4 mRNA was abolished by IM. Knockdown of TLR2 by siRNA transfection resulted in a weaker response of induction of IL8 mRNA in P. gingivalis or PgLPS-stimulated OBA-9. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IM suppresses the induction of IL-8 production by regulating increased levels of TLR2.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of crude extract and metabolites of Phytolacca americana on  pathogens responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral cavity is the store house of different species of microorganisms that are continuously engaged in causing diseases in the mouth. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of crude extracts of the aerial parts of Phytolacca americana and its natural compounds against two oral pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans, which are primarily responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries, as well as a nonpathogenic Escherichia coli. METHODS: Crude extract and fractions from the aerial parts of P. americana (0.008-1.8 mg/mL) were evaluated for their potential antibacterial activity against two oral disease causing microorganisms by micro-assays. The standard natural compounds present in P. americana, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, isoqueritrin and ferulic acid, were also tested for their antibacterial activity against the pathogens at 1-8 mug/mL. RESULTS: The crude extract was highly active against P. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) and moderately active against S. mutans (44% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/mL. The chloroform and hexane fraction controlled the growth of P. gingivalis with 91% and 92% growth inhibition at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. Kaempferol exerted antibacterial activity against both the pathogens, whereas quercetin showed potent growth inhibition activity against only S. mutans in a concentration dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The crude extract, chloroform fraction, and hexane fraction of P. americana possesses active natural compounds that can inhibit the growth of oral disease causing bacteria. Thus, these extracts have the potential for use in the preparation of toothpaste and other drugs related to various oral diseases.
TI  - Effect of Allium cepa L. on Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated Osteoclast Precursor Cell Viability, Count, and Morphology Using 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole-Staining.
AB  - Allium cepa L. is known to possess numerous pharmacological properties. Our aim was to examine the in vitro effects of Allium cepa L. extract (AcE) on Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS and Escherichia coli LPS-stimulated osteoclast precursor cells to determine cell viability to other future cell-based assays. Osteoclast precursor cells (RAW 264.7) were stimulated by Pg LPS (1 mug/mL) and E. coli LPS (1 mug/mL) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of AcE (10-1000 mug/mL) for 5 days at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. Resazurin reduction and total protein content assays were used to detect cell viability. AcE did not affect cell viability. Resazurin reduction assay showed that AcE, at up to 1000 mug/mL, did not significantly affect cell viability and cellular protein levels. Additionally a caspase 3/7 luminescence assay was used to disclose apoptosis and there was no difference in apoptotic activity between tested groups and control group. Fluorescence images stained by DAPI showed no alteration on the morphology and cell counts of LPS-stimulated osteoclast precursor cells with the use of AcE in all tested concentrations when compared to control. These findings suggest that Allium cepa L. extract could be used for in vitro studies on Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS and Escherichia coli LPS-stimulated osteoclast precursor cells.
TI  - Development of a novel plasmid vector pTIO-1 adapted for electrotransformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - We report here the construction of a plasmid vector designed for the efficient electrotransformation of the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. The novel Escherichia coli-Bacteroides/P. gingivalis shuttle vector, designated pTIO-1, is based on the 11.0-kb E. coli-Bacteroides conjugative shuttle vector, pVAL-1 (a pB8-51 derivative). To construct pTIO-1, the pB8-51 origin of replication and erythromycin resistance determinant of pVAL-1 were cloned into the E. coli cloning vector pBluescript II SK(-) and non-functional regions were deleted. pTIO-1 has an almost complete multiple cloning site from pBluescript II SK(-). The size of pTIO-1 is 4.5kb, which is convenient for routine gene manipulation. pTIO-1 was introduced into P. gingivalis via electroporation, and erythromycin-resistant transformants carrying pTIO-1 were obtained. We characterized the transformation efficiency, copy number, host range, stability, and insert size capacity of pTIO-1. An efficient plasmid electrotransformation of P. gingivalis will facilitate functional analysis and expression of P. gingivalis genes, including the virulence factors of this bacterium.
TI  - Bacteria and bacterial DNA in atherosclerotic plaque and aneurysmal wall biopsies from patients with and without periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported an association between chronic periodontitis (CP) and cardiovascular diseases. Detection of periodontopathogens, including red complex bacteria (RCB), in vascular lesions has suggested these bacteria to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate bacteria and their DNA in vascular biopsies from patients with vascular diseases (VD; i.e. abdominal aortic aneurysms, atherosclerotic carotid, and common femoral arteries), with and without CP. METHODS: DNA was extracted from vascular biopsies selected from 40 VD patients: 30 with CP and 10 without CP. The V3-V5 region of the 16S rDNA (V3-V5) was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, and the amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli, sequenced, and classified (GenBank and the Human Oral Microbiome database). Species-specific primers were used for the detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, 10 randomly selected vascular biopsies from the CP group were subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for visualization of bacteria. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was performed to assess the presence of RCB in 10 randomly selected subgingival plaque samples from CP patients. RESULTS: A higher load and mean diversity of bacteria were detected in vascular biopsies from VD patients with CP compared to those without CP. Enterobacteriaceae were frequently detected in vascular biopsies together with cultivable, commensal oral, and not-yet-cultured bacterial species. While 70% of the subgingival plaque samples from CP patients showed presence of RCB, only P. gingivalis was detected in one vascular biopsy. Bacterial cells were seen in all 10 vascular biopsies examined by SEM. CONCLUSIONS: A higher bacterial load and more diverse colonization were detected in VD lesions of CP patients as compared to patients without CP. This indicated that a multitude of bacterial species both from the gut and the oral cavity, rather than exclusively periodontopathogens, may be involved as additional risk factors in the pathogenesis of VD.
TI  - Transcriptome dynamics-based operon prediction in prokaryotes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inferring operon maps is crucial to understanding the regulatory networks of prokaryotic genomes. Recently, RNA-seq based transcriptome studies revealed that in many bacterial species the operon structure vary with the change of environmental conditions. Therefore, new computational solutions that use both static and dynamic data are necessary to create condition specific operon predictions. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a novel classification method that integrates RNA-seq based transcriptome profiles with genomic sequence features to accurately identify the operons that are expressed under a measured condition. The classifiers are trained on a small set of confirmed operons and then used to classify the remaining gene pairs of the organism studied. Finally, by linking consecutive gene pairs classified as operons, our computational approach produces condition-dependent operon maps. We evaluated our approach on various RNA-seq expression profiles of the bacteria Haemophilus somni, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Our results demonstrate that, using features depending on both transcriptome dynamics and genome sequence characteristics, we can identify operon pairs with high accuracy. Moreover, the combination of DNA sequence and expression data results in more accurate predictions than each one alone. CONCLUSION: We present a computational strategy for the comprehensive analysis of condition-dependent operon maps in prokaryotes. Our method can be used to generate condition specific operon maps of many bacterial organisms for which high-resolution transcriptome data is available.
TI  - Defining the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD) in rheumatoid arthritis through the study of PPAD biology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibodies to citrullinated proteins are a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Porphyromonas gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD) has been implicated in the initiation of RA by generating citrullinated neoantigens and due to its ability to autocitrullinate. OBJECTIVES: To define the citrullination status and biology of PPAD in P gingivalis and to characterise the anti-PPAD antibody response in RA and associated periodontal disease (PD). METHODS: PPAD in P gingivalis cells and culture supernatant were analysed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry to detect citrullination. Recombinant PPAD (rPPAD), inactive mutant PPAD (rPPADC351S), and N-terminal truncated PPAD (rPPADNtx) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Patients with RA and healthy controls were assayed for IgG antibodies to citrullinated rPPAD and unmodified rPPADC351S by ELISA. Anti-PPAD antibodies were correlated with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (third-generation) antibody levels, RA disease activity and PD status. RESULTS: PPAD from P gingivalis is truncated at the N-terminal and C-terminal domains and not citrullinated. Only when artificially expressed in E coli, full-length rPPAD, but not truncated (fully active) rPPADNtx, is autocitrullinated. Anti-PPAD antibodies show no heightened reactivity to citrullinated rPPAD, but are exclusively directed against the unmodified enzyme. Antibodies against PPAD do not correlate with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide levels and disease activity in RA. By contrast, anti-PPAD antibody levels are significantly decreased in RA patients with PD. CONCLUSIONS: PPAD autocitrullination is not the underlying mechanism linking PD and RA. N-terminal processing protects PPAD from autocitrullination and enhances enzyme activity. Anti-PPAD antibodies may have a protective role for the development of PD in patients with RA.
TI  - Identification of a diguanylate cyclase and its role in Porphyromonas gingivalis  virulence.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative obligate anaerobic bacterium and is considered a keystone pathogen in the initiation of periodontitis, one of the most widespread infectious diseases. Bacterial bis-(3'-5') cyclic GMP (cyclic di-GMP [c-di-GMP]) serves as a second messenger and is involved in modulating virulence factors in numerous bacteria. However, the role of this second messenger has not been investigated in P. gingivalis, mainly due to a lack of an annotation regarding diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) in this bacterium. Using bioinformatics tools, we found a protein, PGN_1932, containing a GGDEF domain. A deletion mutation in the pgn_1932 gene had a significant effect on the intracellular c-di-GMP level in P. gingivalis. Genetic analysis showed that expression of the fimA and rgpA genes, encoding the major protein subunit of fimbriae and an arginine-specific proteinase, respectively, was downregulated in the pgn_1932 mutant. Correspondingly, FimA protein production and the fimbrial display on the mutant were significantly reduced. Mutations in the pgn_1932 gene also had a significant impact on the adhesive and invasive capabilities of P. gingivalis, which are required for its pathogenicity. These findings provide evidence that the PGN_1932 protein is both responsible for synthesizing c-di-GMP and involved in biofilm formation and host cell invasion by P. gingivalis by controlling the expression and biosynthesis of FimA.
TI  - A biochemical analysis of the interaction of Porphyromonas gingivalis HU PG0121 protein with DNA.
AB  - K-antigen capsule, a key virulence determinant of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, is synthesized by proteins encoded in a series of genes transcribed as a large polycistronic message. Previously, we identified a 77-base pair inverted repeat region with the potential to form a large stem-loop structure at the 5' end of this locus. PG0121, one of two genes flanking the capsule operon, was found to be co-transcribed with the operon and to share high similarity to the DNA binding protein HU from Escherichia coli. A null mutation in PG0121 results in down-regulation of transcription of the capsule synthesis genes and production of capsule. Furthermore, we have also shown that PG0121 gene can complement multiple deficiencies in a strain of E. coli that is deficient for both the alpha and beta subunits of HU. Here, we examined the biochemical properties of the interaction of PG0121 to DNA with the emphasis on the kinds of nucleic acid architectures that may be encountered at the 77-bp inverted repeat. We have concluded that although some DNA binding characteristics are shared with E. coli HU, HU PG0121 also shows some distinct characteristics that set it apart from other HU-like proteins tested to date. We discuss our results in the context of how PG0121 may affect the regulation of the K-antigen capsule expression.
TI  - Palatal mucosa derived fibroblasts present an adaptive behavior regarding cytokine secretion when grafted onto the gingival margin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering that grafted gingival tissue might have to be adapted to  the receptor area and that fibroblasts have the ability to respond to bacterial stimuli through the release of various cytokines, this study investigated whether fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa behave differently when grafted onto the gingival margin regarding cytokine secretion. METHODS: Biopsies from the palatal mucosa were collected at the time of free gingival graft surgery, and after four months re-collection was performed upon surgery for root coverage. Fibroblasts were isolated by the explant technique, cultured and stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Escherichia coli (Ec) LPS for 24 or 48 h for comparative evaluation of the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, TGF-beta, VEGF and CXCL16. Unstimulated cells were used as the control group. Cells were tested for viability through MTT assay, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines was evaluated in the cell supernatants by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa maintained the same secretion pattern of IL-6 when grafted onto the gingival margin. On the contrary, fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft showed increased secretion of IL-8/CXCL8 even in the absence of stimulation. Interestingly, MIP-1alpha/CCL3 secretion by fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft was significantly increased after 48 hours of stimulation with Pg LPS and after 24 h with Ec LPS. Only fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft showed secretion of TGF-beta. VEGF and CXCL16 secretion were not detected by both subsets of fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: Fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa seem to be adapted to local conditions of the site microenvironment when grafted onto the gingival marginal area. This evidence supports the effective participation of fibroblasts in the homeostasis of the marginal periodontium through secretion modulation of important inflammatory mediators.
TI  - Xylitol, an anticaries agent, exhibits potent inhibition of inflammatory responses in human THP-1-derived macrophages infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xylitol is a well-known anticaries agent and has been used for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of xylitol are evaluated for possible use in the prevention and treatment of periodontal infections. METHODS: Cytokine expression was stimulated in THP-1 (human monocyte cell line)-derived macrophages by live Porphyromonas gingivalis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a commercial multiplex assay kit were used to determine the effects of xylitol on live P. gingivalis-induced production of cytokine. The effects of xylitol on phagocytosis and the production of nitric oxide were determined using phagocytosis assay, viable cell count, and Griess reagent. The effects of xylitol on P. gingivalis adhesion were determined by immunostaining, and costimulatory molecule expression was examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Live P. gingivalis infection increased the production of representative proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta, in a multiplicity of infection- and time-dependent manner. Live P. gingivalis also enhanced the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-12 p40, eotaxin, interferon gamma-induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1. The pretreatment of xylitol significantly inhibited the P. gingivalis-induced cytokines production and nitric oxide production. In addition, xylitol inhibited the attachment of live P. gingivalis on THP-1-derived macrophages. Furthermore, xylitol exerted antiphagocytic activity against both Escherichia coli and P. gingivalis. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that xylitol acts as an anti-inflammatory agent in THP-1-derived macrophages infected with live P. gingivalis, which supports its use in periodontitis.
TI  - Porphyromonas Gingivalis and E-coli induce different cytokine production patterns in pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnant individuals of many species, including humans, are more sensitive to various bacteria or their products as compared with non-pregnant individuals. Pregnant individuals also respond differently to different bacteria or their products. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated whether the increased sensitivity of pregnant women to bacterial products and their heterogeneous response to different bacteria was associated with differences in whole blood cytokine production upon stimulation with bacteria or their products. METHODS: Blood samples were taken from healthy pregnant and age-matched non-pregnant women and ex vivo stimulated with bacteria or LPS from Porphyromonas Gingivalis (Pg) or E-coli for 24 hrs. TNFalpha, IL-1ss, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-10 were measured using a multiplex Luminex system. RESULTS: We observed a generally lower cytokine production after stimulation with Pg bacteria or it's LPS as compared with E-coli bacteria. However, there was also an effect of pregnancy upon cytokine production: in pregnant women the production of IL-6 upon Pg stimulation was decreased as compared with non-pregnant women. After stimulation with E-coli, the production of IL-12 and TNFalpha was decreased in pregnant women as compared with non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that cytokine production upon bacterial stimulation of whole blood differed between pregnant and non-pregnant women, showing that the increased sensitivity of pregnant women may be due to differences in cytokine production. Moreover, pregnancy also affected whole blood cytokine production upon Pg or E-coli stimulation differently. Thus, the different responses of pregnant women to different bacteria or their products may result from variations in cytokine production.
TI  - Different effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide and TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 on the adhesion molecules expression in endothelial cells.
AB  - Recent researches suggest an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease. Periodontopathic bacteria and/or their component might play a role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In the present study, we investigated in vitro the effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the expression of adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as its effect on Escherichia coli LPS-induced response. The effect of P. gingivalis LPS was compared with that of toll-like receptor 2 agonist synthetic triacylated lipoprotein Pam3-Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam3CSK4). Gene and protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were measured using RT-PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. P. gingivalis LPS stimulated the expression levels of all adhesion molecules in a dose-dependent manner. However, the response of HUVECs to P. gingivalis LPS was markedly lower than that to E. coli LPS. Moreover, P. gingivalis LPS attenuated E. coli LPS-induced responses when HUVECs were simultaneously stimulated with both kinds of LPS. Treatment with Pam3CSK4 resulted in a minor increase of adhesion molecule expression and did not diminish E. coli LPS-induced responses. Our data suggest that P. gingivalis LPS induces in vitro the expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, which might promote atherogenesis. Qualitatively different responses of HUVECs to P. gingivalis LPS and Pam3CSK4 suggest that besides TLR2 other signaling pathways might be involved in the effects of P. gingivalis LPS.
TI  - Mucosal vaccination shapes the expression of salivary antibodies and establishment of CD8+ T-cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucosal vaccination for preventing periodontitis shows promising results. However, various administration routes and adjuvants may have a substantial role in the efficacy of the vaccination. The aim of the study is to compare different modes of mucosal vaccination with whole-cell Porphyromonas gingivalis and to test the role of various adjuvants as potential modifiers of this process. METHODS: Mucosal vaccine was administered through oral or nasal routes to BALB/C mice. The tested adjuvants included Escherichia coli cholera toxin, E. coli labile toxin (LT), and unmethylated CpG dinucleotide (CpG). Control mice were vaccinated subcutaneously. Saliva and serum were collected; anti-P. gingivalis salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG were quantified. A quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure anti-P. gingivalis IgA levels was established. In addition, cells were extracted from head and neck lymph nodes, and the relative CD8(+) cells were quantified using flow cytometry. RESULTS: All mucosal vaccination modes induced anti-P. gingivalis salivary IgA but not anti-P. gingivalis serum IgG. Subcutaneous vaccination induced both salivary IgA and serum IgG against P. gingivalis. Mucosal vaccination also induced greater establishment of CD8(+) cells compared to the subcutaneous vaccination. Oral mucosal vaccinations with LT or CpG were the most efficient for salivary IgA expression and CD8 cell establishment in lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Oral and nasal mucosal vaccination induced a local host response with little systemic effect. The use of CpG or LT as adjuvants with the oral mucosal vaccination was the most efficient vaccination mode in the present mouse model.
TI  - Different effects of P. gingivalis LPS and E. coli LPS on the expression of interleukin-6 in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gingival fibroblasts (GFs) produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, which is thought to be mediated by activation of toll-like receptors (TLR)2 and TLR4. The present study investigated the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, TLR2, and TLR4 in GFs of seven different donors upon stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS. The effects of P. gingivalis LPS were compared with those of TLR4 agonist Escherichia coli LPS and TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GFs were stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, E. coli LPS or Pam3CSK4 and the expression of IL-6, TLR2 and TLR4 was measured by qPCR. The surface expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In GFs from three donors, P. gingivalis LPS and Pam3CSK4 induced a markedly lower increase in IL-6 expression than E. coli LPS. This was accompanied by significant down-regulation of the TLR2 and TLR4 expression. In GFs from another four donors, an increase in IL-6 expression upon stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS and Pam3CSK4 was similar or even higher than that induced by E. coli LPS. In GFs of these donors, all stimuli induced an up-regulation of both mRNA and protein expression of TLR2 and did not influence that of TLR4. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that P. gingivalis LPS and E. coli LPS differently regulate cytokine production in human gingival fibroblasts. Regulation of the expression level of TLR2 and TLR4 by periodontal pathogens might be an important factor controlling the inflammatory response in GFs.
TI  - Induction of immune response and prevention of alveolar bone loss with recombinant Porphyromonas gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatments for periodontitis are not absolutely perfect, and a vaccine against Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) could become a valuable adjunct therapy for periodontitis. DESIGN: In this study, a vaccine of peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) from P. gingivalis was evaluated in P. gingivalis-induced murine lesion and periodontitis models. The prevention of alveolar bone loss analysis determined by micro-computed X-ray tomography (micro-CT), and histological assays. Furthermore, the induction of immune response of mouse anti-PAD done with ELISA and Western Blot analysis. RESULTS: Compared with animal immunization with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) alone, PAD group significantly inhibited (P<0.05) bone resorption. ELISA and Western Blot showed that PAD induced response involving immunoglobulin G1 (Ig G1) predominantly. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PAD could be a candidate antigen for a vaccine against P. gingivalis infection.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength (red, green, and blue) light-emitting diode irradiation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelengths, providing average power output and effects on three common pathogenic bacteria. BACKGROUND DATA: Ultraviolet (UV) light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of UV may not be unique, as 425 nm produces a similar effect. The bactericidal effects of light-emitting diode (LED) wavelengths such as 625 and 525 nm have not been described. Before conducting clinical trials, the appropriate wavelength with reasonable dose and exposure time should be established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength LED irradiation were investigated in vitro for the anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis and two aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli DH5alpha). Average power output was 6 mW/cm(2) for 1 h. The bacteria were exposed to LED irradiation for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (21.6, 43.2, 86.4, and 172.8 J/cm(2), respectively). LED irradiation was performed during growth on agar and in broth. Control bacteria were incubated without LED irradiation. Bacterial growth was expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) and at an optical density at 600 nm in agar and broth. RESULTS: The bactericidal effect of LED phototherapy depended upon wavelength, power density, bacterial viable number, and bacteria species. The bactericidal effect of 425 and 525 nm irradiation varied depending upon the bacterial inoculation, compared with unirradiated samples and samples irradiated with red light. Especially, P. gingivalis and E. coli DH5alpha were killed by 425 nm, and S. aureus growth was inhibited by 525 nm. However, the wavelength of 625 nm was not bactericidal for P. gingivalis, E. coli DH5alpha, or S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation at 625 nm light was not bactericidal to S. aureus, E. coli, and P. gingivalis, whereas wavelengths of 425 and 525 nm had bactericidal effects. S. aureus was also killed at 525 nm.
TI  - Endotoxin tolerance induced by lipopolysaccharides derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli: alternations in Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 signaling pathway.
AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease induced by bacteria. Exposure of  the host to periodontal pathogens and their virulence factors induces a hyporesponsive state to subsequent challenge, which is termed endotoxin tolerance. In this experiment, we studied the cytokine production in THP-1 cells upon single or repeated Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS stimulation by ELISA. In addition, the protein expression profiles of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and IRAK-M and the gene expression changes of Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) and suppressor of cytokine-signaling-1 (SOCS1) were explored to identify possible mechanisms for changes in cytokine secretion. After repeated stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS or E. coli LPS, secretions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were decreased significantly compared with those following single challenge, while the levels of IL-10 were increased (p < 0.05). Only comparable levels of IL-8 were confirmed in P. gingivalis LPS-tolerized cells (p > 0.05). In addition, severe downregulation of TLR2 was detected in THP-1 cells retreated with P. gingivalis LPS, and the reduction of TLR4 expression was observed in cells restimulated with E. coli LPS (p < 0.05). Precondition with P. gingivalis LPS or E. coli LPS also led to an enhancement of IRAK-M and SOCS1, while maintaining the expressions of IRAK4 and Tollip. This pattern of cytokine production indicates the different effects of endotoxin tolerance triggered by P. gingivalis LPS and E. coli LPS, which might contribute to limiting inflammatory damage. Moreover, TLR2, TLR4, IRAK-M, and SOCS1 might play important roles in developing tolerance.
TI  - Structures of the Porphyromonas gingivalis OxyR regulatory domain explain differences in expression of the OxyR regulon in Escherichia coli and P. gingivalis.
AB  - OxyR transcriptionally regulates Escherichia coli oxidative stress response genes through a reversibly reducible cysteine disulfide biosensor of cellular redox status. Structural changes induced by redox changes in these cysteines are conformationally transmitted to the dimer subunit interfaces, which alters dimer and tetramer interactions with DNA. In contrast to E. coli OxyR regulatory-domain structures, crystal structures of Porphyromonas gingivalis OxyR regulatory domains show minimal differences in dimer configuration on changes in cysteine disulfide redox status. This locked configuration of the P. gingivalis OxyR regulatory-domain dimer closely resembles the oxidized (activating) form of the E. coli OxyR regulatory-domain dimer. It correlates with the observed constitutive activation of some oxidative stress genes in P. gingivalis and is attributable to a single amino-acid insertion in P. gingivalis OxyR relative to E. coli OxyR. Modelling of full-length P. gingivalis, E. coli and Neisseria meningitidis OxyR-DNA complexes predicts different modes of DNA binding for the reduced and oxidized forms of each.
TI  - DNA-based adaptive immunity protect host from infection-associated periodontal bone resorption via recognition of Porphyromonas gingivalis virulence component.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is one of a constellation of oral organisms associated with human chronic periodontitis. While adaptive immunity to periodontal pathogen proteins has been investigated and is an important component of periodontal bone resorption, the effect of periodontal pathogen DNA in eliciting systemic and mucosal antibody and modulating immune responses has not been investigated. METHODS: Rowett rats were locally injected with whole genomic Pg DNA in alum. Escherichia coli (Ec) genomic DNA, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) genomic DNA, and saline/alum injected rats served as controls. After various time points, serum IgG and salivary IgA antibody to Ec, Fn or Pg were detected by ELISA. Serum and salivary antibody reactions with Pg surface antigens were determined by Western blot analyses and the specific antigen was identified by mass spectrometry. Effects of genomic DNA immunization on Pg bacterial colonization and experimental periodontal bone resorption were also evaluated. RESULTS: Sera from Pg DNA, Ec DNA and Fn DNA-injected rats did not react with Ec or Fn bacteria. Serum IgG antibody levels to Pg and Pg surface extracts were significantly higher in animals immunized with Pg DNA as compared to the control groups. Rats injected with Pg DNA demonstrated a strong serum IgG and salivary IgA antibody reaction solely to Pg fimbrillin (41kDa), the major protein component of Pg fimbriae. In the Pg DNA-immunized group, the numbers of Pg bacteria in oral cavity and the extent of periodontal bone resorption were significantly reduced after Pg infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that infected hosts may select specific genes from whole genomic DNA of the periodontal pathogen for transcription and presentation. The results indicate that the unique gene selected can initiate a host protective immune response to the parent bacterium.
TI  - Activated platelets enhance IL-10 secretion and reduce TNF-alpha secretion by monocytes.
AB  - Activated platelets are known to modulate immune responses by secreting or shedding a range of immunomodulatory substances. We examined the influence of activated platelets on cytokine production by normal human mononuclear cells, induced by tetanus toxoid (TT), human thyroglobulin (TG), Escherichia coli LPS, or intact Porphyromonas gingivalis. Addition of platelets activated by thrombin-receptor-activating peptide enhanced IL-10 production induced by LPS (p < 0.001), TG (p < 0.05), and P. gingivalis (p < 0.01), and reduced the production of TNF-alpha induced by LPS (p < 0.001), TG (p < 0.05), and P. gingivalis (p < 0.001), and of IL-6 in LPS- and P. gingivalis-stimulated cultures (p < 0.001). Similar effects on IL-10 and TNF-alpha production were observed on addition of platelet supernatant to mononuclear cells, whereas addition of recombinant soluble CD40L mimicked the effects on IL-10 production. Moreover, Ab-mediated blockade of CD40L counteracted the effect of platelets and platelet supernatants on TNF-alpha production. Monocytes separated into two populations with respect to IL-10 production induced by TG; the high-secreting fraction increased from 0.8 to 2.1% (p < 0.001) on addition of activated platelets. Adherence of platelets increased TG- and TT-induced IL-10 secretion by monocytes (p < 0.05). In addition, activated platelets inhibited CD4(+) T cell proliferation elicited by TT (p < 0.001) and P. gingivalis (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that activated platelets have anti-inflammatory properties related to the interaction between CD40L and CD40, and exert a hitherto undescribed immunoregulatory action by enhancing IL-10 production and inhibiting TNF-alpha production by monocytes.
TI  - Whole-blood cultures from patients with chronic periodontitis respond differently to Porphyromonas gingivalis but not Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis lipid A heterogeneity modulates cytokine expression in human cells. This study investigates the effects of two lipid A isoforms of P. gingivalis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1435/1449 and LPS1690, on the secretion of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines in total blood cultures from patients with and without chronic periodontitis (CP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 38 systemically healthy individuals divided in two groups: 1) the CP group (n = 19), in which patients were diagnosed with CP; and 2) the no periodontitis (NP) group (n = 19), which included control patients without CP. Blood samples were collected from all patients, and whole-blood cell cultures (WBCCs) were stimulated for 48 hours with P. gingivalis LPS1435/1449 and LPS1690 and Escherichia coli LPS. Unstimulated WBCCs served as negative controls. The secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was detected in WBCC supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: E. coli LPS significantly increased the expression of all cytokines in WBCCs from both the NP and CP groups when compared to non-stimulated cells (control treatment). P. gingivalis LPS preparations increased IFN-gamma levels in the CP group but not in the NP group when compared with controls (P <0.05). P. gingivalis LPS preparations also increased IL-10 and TGF-beta levels in both CP and NP groups, but P. gingivalis LPS1690 showed a three-fold increase on IL-10 production in the NP group (P <0.05) when compared to P. gingivalis LPS1435/144. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that WBCC cell populations obtained from healthy individuals and patients with CP may differ in the cytokine response to P. gingivalis but not E. coli LPS. This is consistent with the notion that CP alters the systemic WBCC response and that this can be detected by the different P. gingivalis LPS structures.
TI  - What has high-throughput sequencing ever done for us?
AB  - This month's Genome Watch looks back over the past 10 years and highlights how the incredible advances in sequencing technologies have transformed research into microbial genomes.
TI  - LPS-induced inflammatory response after therapy of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - We have reported a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hyper-inflammatory response in localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP). It is unknown whether treatment is able to modulate this LPS responsiveness. Fifty-nine individuals with LAP were treated by mechanical debridement and systemic antibiotics. Clinical parameters and cyto/chemokine responsiveness of whole blood stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis or Escherichia coli LPS were monitored at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Overall, clinical parameters were improved following treatment. Additionally, P. gingivalis LPS induction of eotaxin, IFNgamma, IL10, IL12p40, IL1beta, IL6, IP10, MCP1, MIP1alpha, GM-CSF, and TNFalpha was significantly decreased (p < .05). Similarly, induction of eotaxin, INFgamma, IL10, IL12p40, GM-CSF, and TNFalpha by E. coli LPS was also reduced post-treatment. These reductions correlated with decreases in clinical parameters. Importantly, these reductions in LPS responsiveness were most robust at 3 months, and some lost significance at 6 to 12 months post-treatment. In conclusion, LPS-induced hyper-inflammatory response in LAP can be partially modulated by periodontal therapy. Conversely, rebound in the hyper-responsiveness of some mediators, in the presence of improved clinical parameters, suggests that this phenotype could be partially influenced by a genetic trait and play a role in future disease recurrence (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01330719).
TI  - Propeptide-mediated inhibition of cognate gingipain proteinases.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen associated with chronic periodontitis. The organism's cell-surface cysteine proteinases, the Arg-specific proteinases (RgpA, RgpB) and the Lys-specific proteinase (Kgp), which are known as gingipains have been implicated as major virulence factors. All three gingipain precursors contain a propeptide of around 200 amino acids in length that is removed during maturation. The aim of this study was to characterize the inhibitory potential of the Kgp and RgpB propeptides against the mature cognate enzymes. Mature Kgp was obtained from P. gingivalis mutant ECR368, which produces a recombinant Kgp with an ABM1 motif deleted from the catalytic domain (rKgp) that enables the otherwise membrane bound enzyme to dissociate from adhesins and be released. Mature RgpB was obtained from P. gingivalis HG66. Recombinant propeptides of Kgp and RgpB were produced in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel-affinity chromatography. The Kgp and RgpB propeptides displayed non-competitive inhibition kinetics with K(i) values of 2.04 microM and 12 nM, respectively. Both propeptides exhibited selectivity towards their cognate proteinase. The specificity of both propeptides was demonstrated by their inability to inhibit caspase-3, a closely related cysteine protease, and papain that also has a relatively long propeptide. Both propeptides at 100 mg/L caused a 50% reduction of P. gingivalis growth in a protein-based medium. In summary, this study demonstrates that gingipain propeptides are capable of inhibiting their mature cognate proteinases.
TI  - Identification of Magnolia officinalis L. bark extract as the most potent anti-inflammatory of four plant extracts.
AB  - This study was designed to compare the anti-inflammatory potential of a Magnolia  officinalis L. bark extract solely or in combination with extracts prepared from either Polygonum aviculare L., Sambucus nigra L., or Isodon japonicus L. in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) and human U-937 monocytes, as cell models of periodontal disease. HGF-1 and U-937 cells were incubated with LPS from either Porphyromonas gingivalis or Escherichia coli together with the four plant extracts alone or in combination. Secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from HGF-1 and U-937 cells was measured by means of a multiplexed bead assay system. Magnolia officinalis L. bark extract, at concentrations of 1 mug/mL and 10 mug/mL, reduced interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion from HGF-1 cells to 72.5 +/- 28.6% and reduced matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) secretion from U-937 cells to 8.87 +/- 7.97% compared to LPS-treated cells (100%). The other three extracts also reduced secretion of these inflammatory markers but were not as effective. Combination of 9 mug/mL Magnolia officinalis L. extract with 1 mug/mL of each of the other extracts maintained the anti-inflammatory effect of Magnolia officinalis L. extract. Combination of 5 mug/mL Magnolia officinalis L. extract with 5 mug/mL Isodon japonicus L. extract also maintained the anti-inflammatory potential of the Magnolia officinalis L. extract, whereas increasing concentrations of any of the other plant extracts in the combination experiments reduced the Magnolia officinalis L. extract efficacy in U-937 cells.
TI  - Ketoprofen inhibits expression of inflammatory mediators in human dental pulp cells.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Conventional root canal treatment is the treatment of choice for the irreversible pulpitis caused by bacterial infection. More recently, vital pulp therapy has been proposed as an alternative for management of inflamed dental pulp. Ketoprofen is an anti-inflammatory agent commonly used as a component of mouth rinse for oral lesions. Here, we examined the effect and mechanisms of action of ketoprofen on the expression of inflammatory mediators induced by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in dental pulp cells. METHODS: Human dental pulp cells were exposed to LPS or LPS + ketoprofen, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The effect of these treatments on mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways was assessed by Western blots for extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. RESULTS: LPS induced interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha in dental pulp cells. Ketoprofen effectively inhibited interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha production in LPS-stimulated dental pulp cells. Notably, ketoprofen inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Ketoprofen inhibited expression inflammatory mediators in dental pulp cells stimulated with LPS. The inhibitory effect of ketoprofen on inflammatory cytokines is associated with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
TI  - Role of sodium in the RprY-dependent stress response in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative oral anaerobe which is strongly associated with periodontal disease. Environmental changes in the gingival sulcus trigger the growth of P. gingivalis and a concurrent shift from periodontal health to disease. Bacteria adjust their physiology in response to environmental changes and gene regulation by two-component phospho-relay systems is one mechanism by which such adjustments are effected. In P. gingivalis RprY is an orphan response regulator and previously we showed that the RprY regulon included genes associated with oxidative stress and sodium metabolism. The goals of the present study were to identify environmental signals that induce rprY and clarify the role of the regulator in the stress response. In Escherichia coli an RprY-LacZ fusion protein was induced in sodium- depleted medium and a P. gingivalis rprY mutant was unable to grow in similar medium. By several approaches we established that sodium depletion induced up-regulation of genes involved in oxidative stress. In addition, we demonstrated that RprY interacted directly with the promoters of several molecular chaperones. Further, both genetic and transcription data suggest that the regulator acts as a repressor. We conclude that RprY is one of the regulators that controls stress responses in P. gingivalis, possibly by acting as a repressor since an rprY mutant showed a superstress reponse in sodium-depleted medium which we propose inhibited growth.
TI  - Oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of LL-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Some agents, including Escherichia coli and group A Streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. LL-37 is a human host defence peptide shown previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. However, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of LL-37 remains obscure. In order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on LL-37's activity against E. coli and S. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. Using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. Anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. Both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates as indicated by the growth curves generated. The sensitivities of E. coli and S. pyogenes to LL-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. The oxygen facultative E. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to LL-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. The microaerophilic pathogen S. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to LL-37 under oxygen deprivation. Our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis virulence factor gingipain RgpB shows a unique zymogenic mechanism for cysteine peptidases.
AB  - Zymogenicity is a regulatory mechanism that prevents inadequate catalytic activity in the wrong context. It plays a central role in maintaining microbial virulence factors in an inactive form inside the pathogen until secretion. Among these virulence factors is the cysteine peptidase gingipain B (RgpB), which is the major virulence factor secreted by the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis that attacks host vasculature and defense proteins. The structure of the complex between soluble mature RgpB, consisting of a catalytic domain and an immunoglobulin superfamily domain, and its 205-residue N-terminal prodomain, the largest structurally characterized to date for a cysteine peptidase, reveals a novel fold for the prodomain that is distantly related to sugar-binding lectins. It attaches laterally to the catalytic domain through a large concave surface. The main determinant for latency is a surface "inhibitory loop," which approaches the active-site cleft of the enzyme on its non-primed side in a substrate-like manner. It inserts an arginine (Arg(126)) into the S1 pocket, thus matching the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Downstream of Arg(126), the polypeptide leaves the cleft, thereby preventing cleavage. Moreover, the carbonyl group of Arg(126) establishes a very strong hydrogen bond with the co-catalytic histidine, His(440), pulling it away from the catalytic cysteine, Cys(473), and toward Glu(381), which probably plays a role in orienting the side chain of His(440) during catalysis. The present results provide the structural determinants of zymogenic inhibition of RgpB by way of a novel inhibitory mechanism for peptidases in general and open the field for the design of novel inhibitory strategies in the treatment of human periodontal disease.
TI  - Identification of an O-antigen chain length regulator, WzzP, in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has two different lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) designated O-LPS and A-LPS, which are a conventional O-antigen polysaccharide and an anionic polysaccharide that are both linked to lipid A-cores, respectively. However, the precise mechanisms of LPS biosynthesis remain to be determined. In this study, we isolated a pigment-less mutant by transposon mutagenesis and identified that the transposon was inserted into the coding sequence PGN_2005, which encodes a hypothetical protein of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. We found that (i) LPSs purified from the PGN_2005 mutant were shorter than those of the wild type; (ii) the PGN_2005 protein was located in the inner membrane fraction; and (iii) the PGN_2005 gene conferred Wzz activity upon an Escherichia coli wzz mutant. These results indicate that the PGN_2005 protein, which was designated WzzP, is a functional homolog of the Wzz protein in P. gingivalis. Comparison of amino acid sequences among WzzP and conventional Wzz proteins indicated that WzzP had an additional fragment at the C-terminal region. In addition, we determined that the PGN_1896 and PGN_1233 proteins and the PGN_1033 protein appear to be WbaP homolog proteins and a Wzx homolog protein involved in LPS biosynthesis, respectively.
TI  - Leptin up-regulates TLR2 in human monocytes.
AB  - The adipokine leptin elicits changes in the expression of the activation markers  CD40 and CD69 in PBMCs and DCs, yet its effect on PRRs remains to be elucidated. Serum leptin concentrations are elevated in obesity and T2DM, which are both diseases associated with a proinflammatory state. We therefore investigated a possible role for leptin in monocyte TLR and CD14 expression. Leptin increased TLR2 cell-surface and mRNA expression in THP-1 and primary human monocytes. In contrast, leptin had no effect on monocyte TLR4 expression in THP-1 or primary monocytes. CD14 cell-surface and mRNA expression were increased after leptin stimulation in THP-1 monocytes. However, no change in cell-surface CD14 expression was observed after leptin treatment in primary human monocytes. Leptin also up-regulated the expression of PU.1 and EGR2, transcription factors involved in myeloid cell differentiation. Additionally, leptin potentiated Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion in THP-1 monocytes. In conclusion, we show that leptin and LPS differentially influence monocyte phenotype and demonstrate, for the first time, a regulatory effect of leptin on the monocyte expression of TLR2. Leptin-stimulated TLR2 expression may potentiate innate immunity and inflammation in conditions of hyperleptinemia, such as obesity and T2DM.
TI  - Expression profile of macrophage migration-inhibitory factor in human gingiva and reconstituted human gingival epithelia stimulated by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) plays crucial roles in the recruitment and activation of macrophages as well as in helping to kill bacteria. This study investigated the expression profile of MIF in human gingiva under different periodontal conditions and its expression patterns induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in gingival epithelia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gingival tissue samples were collected from deep pockets and clinically healthy sites of 22 nonsmoking subjects with chronic periodontitis. The expression of MIF mRNA and protein was evaluated using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The in vitro study analyzed the effects of P. gingivalis LPS on the expression of MIF in a reconstituted human gingival epithelia (RHGE) model. RESULTS: In gingival epithelia, MIF protein was diffusely expressed from the basal layer to the granular and spinous layers; whereas, in the underlying connective tissues, MIF was observed around the dilated blood vessels in the deep-pocket tissues. A significantly lower level of expression of MIF mRNA and an increased level of expression of MIF protein were found in deep-pocket tissues compared with clinically healthy tissues. Expression of MIF mRNA in the RHGE model was significantly down-regulated by P. gingivalis LPS. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that MIF expression may be related to periodontal conditions and that its expression profile could be modulated by P. gingivalis LPS. MIF may play a role in periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Nuclear factor-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways are critically involved in Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induction of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein expression in human oral keratinocytes.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -binding protein (LBP) plays a crucial role in innate host response to bacterial challenge. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in periodontal disease and the shift of P. gingivalis LPS lipid A structure from penta-acylated (LPS(1690)) to tetra-acylated (LPS(1435/1449)) isoform may significantly contribute to periodontal pathogenesis. We recently demonstrated that LBP is expressed in human gingiva and contributes to periodontal homeostasis. Furthermore, different isoforms of P. gingivalis LPS differently modulate the immuno-inflammatory response, and P. gingivalis LPS(1690) induces LBP expression in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs). This study further examined the signaling mechanisms of P. gingivalis LPS(1690) -induced and Escherichia coli LPS-induced LBP expression in HOKs. Both P. gingivalis LPS(1690) and E. coli LPS were potent inducers of LBP expression in HOKs. The former activated phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, p65, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), whereas the latter phosphorylated IkappaBalpha, p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK. A nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB transcription factor was confirmed upon stimulation by both forms of LPS. Further blocking assay showed that P. gingivalis LPS(1690) induction of LBP was through NF-kappaB and p38 MPAK pathways, whereas E. coli LPS-induced LBP expression was mediated by NF-kappaB, p38 MPAK and JNK pathways. This study demonstrates that NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are involved in P. gingivalis LPS(1690) induction of LBP expression in HOKs. The current findings could enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of innate defense in maintenance of periodontal homeostasis.
TI  - The nucleoid-associated protein HUbeta affects global gene expression in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - HU is a non-sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and one of the most abundant nucleoid-associated proteins in the bacterial cell. Like Escherichia coli, the genome of Porphyromonas gingivalis is predicted to encode both the HUalpha (PG1258) and the HUbeta (PG0121) subunit. We have previously reported that PG0121 encodes a non-specific DNA-binding protein and that PG0121 is co-transcribed with the K-antigen capsule synthesis operon. We also reported that deletion of PG0121 resulted in downregulation of capsule operon expression and produced a P. gingivalis strain that is phenotypically deficient in surface polysaccharide production. Here, we show through complementation experiments in an E. coli MG1655 hupAB double mutant strain that PG0121 encodes a functional HU homologue. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were used to further investigate global transcriptional regulation by HUbeta using comparative expression profiling of the PG0121 (HUbeta) mutant strain to the parent strain, W83. Our analysis determined that expression of genes encoding proteins involved in a variety of biological functions, including iron acquisition, cell division and translation, as well as a number of predicted nucleoid associated proteins were altered in the PG0121 mutant. Phenotypic and quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses determined that under iron-limiting growth conditions, cell division and viability were defective in the PG0121 mutant. Collectively, our studies show that PG0121 does indeed encode a functional HU homologue, and HUbeta has global regulatory functions in P. gingivalis; it affects not only production of capsular polysaccharides but also expression of genes involved in basic functions, such as cell wall synthesis, cell division and iron uptake.
TI  - [Expression of cytokines of interleukin-6 family in gingival fibroblasts by Toll-like receptor-2].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether signaling through Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2)  can affect the expression of some cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts. METHODS: The gingival fibroblasts were isolated and cultured in vivo, divided into blank control group, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) group and Escherichia coli (Ec) group. mRNA expression levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein expression levels were detected by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The data was statistically analyzed by SPSS16.0 software package. RESULTS: LPS from Pg could stimulate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mRNA and protein, which reached the peak (5.87 +/- 0.83) at 10 h, and the expression level increased with the increase of the Pg concentration. IL-11 or oncostatin-M (OSM) mRNA expression was not affected by LPS. After treated with Pg for 48 h, the protein expression of IL-6 and LIF was up-regulated, (962 +/- 57) ng/L and (47 +/- 18) ng/L respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Signaling through TLR-2 controls the expression of cytokines of IL-6 family in human gingival fibroblasts.
TI  - Identification and characterization of novel glycoproteins involved in growth and biofilm formation by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen associated with  chronic periodontitis. To extend our knowledge of post-translational protein glycosylation in P. gingivalis, a proteomic analysis involving two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with carbohydrate staining and mass spectrometry was performed. Four novel glycoproteins, PGN0743, PGN0876, PGN1513 and PGN0729, in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 were identified. These four identified glycoproteins possess a range of biochemical activities and cellular localization. PGN0743 contains a sequence motif identifying it as a FKBP-type cis-trans isomerase, which has activity usually associated with chaperone functions. PGN0876 and PGN1513 contain tetratricopeptide repeat domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. PGN0729 encodes the outer membrane protein 41 precursor, which was previously identified as Pgm6, and is homologous to the OmpA protein in Escherichia coli. Several different types of glycoprotein were identified, suggesting that P. gingivalis possesses a general mechanism for protein glycosylation. PGN0743-deficient and PGN0876-deficient mutants were constructed to examine the role(s) of the two identified glycoproteins. Both mutants showed a decreased growth rate under nutrient-limited conditions and reduced biofilm formation activity. These results suggest that the novel glycoproteins PGN0743 and PGN0876 play an important role in the growth and colonization of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Differential effects of LPS from Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis on IL-6 production in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Periodontal ligament (PDL) cells produce IL-6 upon stimulation with inflammation promoters, but the signaling pathways involved have not been characterized. This study investigates underlying mechanisms behind regulation of PDL cell IL-6 production by E. coli and P. gingivalis LPS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human PDL cells, endothelial cells and monocytes were stimulated with E. coli or P. gingivalis LPS in the presence or absence of pharmacological agents in order to disclose pathways involved in LPS signaling. Gene expression and cellular protein levels were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Stimulation with LPS from E. coli (1 microg/ml) for 24 h enhanced PDL cell IL-6 expression several fold, demonstrated both on transcript and protein levels, but P. gingivalis LPS (1-5 microg/ml) had no effect. TLR2 mRNA was more highly expressed than TLR4 transcript in PDL cells. Treatment with the non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 microM) reduced E. coli LPS-induced PDL cell IL-6 by 30%, while neither aminoguanidine (10 microM), an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nor estrogen (17beta-estradiol, 100 nM) influenced IL-6. Treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (1 microM) totally prevented the E. coli LPS-induced PDL cell IL-6. In endothelial cells, neither E. coli LPS nor P. gingivalis LPS promoted IL-6 production. In monocytes, serving as positive control, both E. coli and P. gingivalis LPS stimulated IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli LPS but not P. gingivalis LPS stimulates PDL cell IL-6 production through a glucocorticoid-sensitive mechanism involving nitric oxide formation, probably via endothelial nitric oxide synthase.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide causes resistin  release from neutrophils.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It was reported that periodontitis is associated with increased serum resistin levels. We examined whether there was a difference between the release of resistin from neutrophils incubated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis and with LPS from Escherichia coli, and which cell-surface receptors and intracellular kinases were involved in this process. METHODS: Several concentrations of P. gingivalis-LPS and E. coli-LPS were added to neutrophils, supernatant from cultured neutrophils was collected, and resistin levels were measured by ELISA. To examine signaling pathways, neutrophils were pretreated with monoclonal antibodies against CD14, CD18, TLR2, and TLR4, and specific inhibitors of PI3K and MAPKs. RESULTS: Resistin release from neutrophils was induced both by P. gingivalis-LPS and E. coli-LPS, but resistin release by P. gingivalis-LPS was weaker than E. coli-LPS in low concentrations. Resistin release was decreased by pretreatment with monoclonal antibodies against CD14, CD18, and TLR4, but not by TLR2. Moreover, it was decreased by inhibitors of PI3K, JNK, and p38 MAPK, but not by ERK1/2. CONCLUSIONS: Resistin release from neutrophils was induced by both P. gingivalis-LPS and E. coli-LPS. This was decreased by CD14, CD18, and TLR4 and was dependent on PI3K, JNK, and p38 MAPK, but not on ERK1/2 in intracellular pathways of neutrophils.
TI  - Putative down-stream signaling molecule of GTPase in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a strict anaerobic bacterium mainly responsible for periodontal disease in oral cavity. Putative GTPase gene (pgp) of this bacterium was cloned and its recombinant protein (rPGP) was produced in Escherichia coli. Based on the amino acid sequence of SGP that is a GTP-binding protein of Streptococcus mutans, putative GTPase amino acid sequence was deduced in the data base of genome sequences of Porphyromonas gingivalis. A 900-bp PCR fragment was amplified with P. gingivalis genomic DNA as a template and cloned into E. coli JM 109. Then pgp was transferred into pQE-30 expression vector to make pQE-PGP for production of rPGR. This protein was produced and purified by Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography. Anti-PGP antibody was also produced in Sprague Dawley rats. Using Westernblot analysis with this antibody, it was confirmed that the rPGP produced in E. coli was identical to that of donor strain. Furthermore, by Southernblot analysis it was revealed that the pgp was originated from P. gingivalis. By immunoprecipitation with anti-PGP antibody and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis it was found that PGP was able to bind to acetate kinase, which was reported to be a secondary signaling-molecule in anaerobic microorganisms. Therefore, these results imply that P. gingivalis produces putative GTPase and this protein might play a potential role in signaling pathway in oral biofilm formation.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis FimA fimbriae: fimbrial assembly by fimA alone in the fim gene cluster and differential antigenicity among fimA genotypes.
AB  - The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizes largely through FimA  fimbriae, composed of polymerized FimA encoded by fimA. fimA exists as a single copy within the fim gene cluster (fim cluster), which consists of seven genes: fimX, pgmA and fimA-E. Using an expression vector, fimA alone was inserted into a mutant from which the whole fim cluster was deleted, and the resultant complement exhibited a fimbrial structure. Thus, the genes of the fim cluster other than fimA were not essential for the assembly of FimA fimbriae, although they were reported to influence FimA protein expression. It is known that there are various genotypes for fimA, and it was indicated that the genotype was related to the morphological features of FimA fimbriae, especially the length, and to the pathogenicity of the bacterium. We next complemented the fim cluster-deletion mutant with fimA genes cloned from P. gingivalis strains including genotypes I to V. All genotypes showed a long fimbrial structure, indicating that FimA itself had nothing to do with regulation of the fimbrial length. In FimA fimbriae purified from the complemented strains, types I, II, and III showed slightly higher thermostability than types IV and V. Antisera of mice immunized with each purified fimbria principally recognized the polymeric, structural conformation of the fimbriae, and showed low cross-reactivity among genotypes, indicating that FimA fimbriae of each genotype were antigenically different. Additionally, the activity of a macrophage cell line stimulated with the purified fimbriae was much lower than that induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - Bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane Toll-like receptor expression.
AB  - PROBLEM: Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pPROM) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (PTB) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection and inflammation. The membranes may sense and respond to microbes via Toll-like receptors (TLRs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation in this tissue. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLRs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and PTB. METHOD OF STUDY: Normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. After 24 hrs, RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR performed for TLRs1-10. RESULTS: Treatment of fetal membranes with Mycoplasma hominis increased expression of TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8 mRNA. Ureaplasma parvum upregulated TLR8 mRNA, and Porphyromonas gingivalis significantly increased fetal membrane TLR7 expression. In contrast, treatment with Gram-negative Escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated TLR10 mRNA. No effect was detected for Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Group B Streptococcus. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane TLR expression patterns. Moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pPROM and PTB, arise.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli but not from Porphyromonas gingivalis induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and alkaline phosphatase in dental follicle cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dental follicle cells (DFCs) as periodontal precursor cells are the natural source for cellular therapies of periodontitis. Periodontitis is initiated after the infection of the periodontium with oral pathogens such as the Gram-negative bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies have shown that especially P. gingivalis LPS induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PDL cells and disturbs the differentiation of dental stem cells. Our study investigated the administration of LPS to DFCs for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated cell proliferation (WST1 assay), expression of cytokines IL1beta, IL8 and IL6 (real-time RT-PCR) and the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs (ALP-activity and Alizarin red staining) in the presence of P. gingivalis LPS and Escherichia coli LPS. RESULTS: All tested pro-inflammatory cytokines were highly increased after E. coli LPS treatment. P. gingivalis LPS induces only the expression of IL8, but this expression was significantly lower than that after E. coli LPS administration. The ALP activity was significantly higher in DFCs after the administration of E. coli LPS than after administration of P. gingivalis LPS or under normal cell differentiation conditions. However, the mineralization was inhibited with LPS from both bacterial species. CONCLUSION: LPS disturbs osteogenic differentiation in DFCs. Moreover, the failure of pro-inflammatory cytokines induction in DFCs after the administration of P. gingivalis LPS differs greatly from that of PDL fibroblasts. These immunological properties of DFCs have to be considered for cellular therapies of periodontitis with DFCs.
TI  - Cytokine production induced by non-encapsulated and encapsulated Porphyromonas gingivalis strains.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the exact reason is not known, encapsulated gram-negative Porphyromonas gingivalis strains are more virulent than non-encapsulated strains. Since difference in virulence properties may be due to difference in cytokine production following recognition of the bacteria or their products by the host inflammatory cells, we compared cytokine production following stimulation with bacteria or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of a non-encapsulated and an encapsulated P. gingivalis strain (K(-) and K1). DESIGN: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production following stimulation of the cell-line Mono Mac 6 with bacteria or LPS of both P. gingivalis strains was determined using flow cytometry. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of the two P. gingivalis strains or their LPS on TNF-alpha and Interleukin (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-10) production in whole blood using Luminex. In both experiments, Escherichia coli bacteria and LPS were used as a reference. RESULTS: Both P. gingivalis strains induced lower cytokine production than E. coli with the exception of IL-6. P. gingivalis K1 bacteria elicited a higher overall cytokine production than P. gingivalis K(-). In contrast, P. gingivalis K1 LPS stimulation induced a lower cytokine production than P. gingivalis K(-) LPS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the encapsulated P. gingivalis K1 bacteria induce higher cytokine production than the non-encapsulated P. gingivalis K(-). This was not due to its LPS. The stronger induction of cytokines may contribute to the higher virulence of P. gingivalis K1.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides and nitric oxide production by neutrophils from periodontitis subjects.
AB  - Neutrophils play an important role in periodontitis by producing nitric oxide (NO) and antimicrobial peptides, molecules with microbicidal activity via oxygen-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. It is unknown whether variation in the production of antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37, human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1-3, and NO by neutrophils influences the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. We compared the production of these peptides and NO by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects and from patients with periodontitis. Peripheral blood neutrophils were cultured with or without Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-LPS (Aa-LPS), Porphyromonas gingivalis-LPS (Pg-LPS) and Escherichia coli-LPS (Ec-LPS). qRT-PCR was used to determine quantities of HNP 1-3 and LL-37 mRNA in neutrophils. Amounts of HNP 1-3 and LL-37 proteins in the cell culture supernatants were also determined by ELISA. In addition, NO levels in neutrophil culture supernatants were quantitated by the Griess reaction. Neutrophils from periodontitis patients cultured with Aa-LPS, Pg-LPS and Ec-LPS expressed higher HNP 1-3 mRNA than neutrophils from healthy subjects. LL-37 mRNA expression was higher in neutrophils from patients stimulated with Aa-LPS. Neutrophils from periodontitis patients produced significantly higher LL-37 protein levels than neutrophils from healthy subjects when stimulated with Pg-LPS and Ec-LPS, but no difference was observed in HNP 1-3 production. Neutrophils from periodontitis patients cultured or not with Pg-LPS and Ec-LPS produced significantly lower NO levels than neutrophils from healthy subjects. The significant differences in the production of LL-37 and NO between neutrophils from healthy and periodontitis subjects indicate that production of these molecules might influence individual susceptibility to important periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis mediates inflammasome repression in polymicrobial cultures through a novel mechanism involving reduced endocytosis.
AB  - The interleukin (IL)-1beta-processing inflammasome has recently been identified as a target for pathogenic evasion of the inflammatory response by a number of bacteria and viruses. We postulated that the periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis may suppress the inflammasome as a mechanism for its low immunogenicity and pathogenic synergy with other, more highly immunogenic periodontal bacteria. Our results show that P. gingivalis lacks signaling capability for the activation of the inflammasome in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, P. gingivalis can suppress inflammasome activation by another periodontal bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum. This repression affects IL-1beta processing, as well as other inflammasome-mediated processes, including IL-18 processing and cell death, in both human and mouse macrophages. F. nucleatum activates IL-1beta processing through the Nlrp3 inflammasome; however, P. gingivalis repression is not mediated through reduced levels of inflammasome components. P. gingivalis can repress Nlrp3 inflammasome activation by Escherichia coli, and by danger-associated molecular patterns and pattern-associated molecular patterns that mediate activation through endocytosis. However, P. gingivalis does not suppress Nlrp3 inflammasome activation by ATP or nigericin. This suggests that P. gingivalis may preferentially suppress endocytic pathways toward inflammasome activation. To directly test whether P. gingivalis infection affects endocytosis, we assessed the uptake of fluorescent particles in the presence or absence of P. gingivalis. Our results show that P. gingivalis limits both the number of cells taking up beads and the number of beads taken up for bead-positive cells. These results provide a novel mechanism of pathogen-mediated inflammasome inhibition through the suppression of endocytosis.
TI  - HcpR of Porphyromonas gingivalis is required for growth under nitrosative stress  and survival within host cells.
AB  - Although the Gram-negative, anaerobic periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis must withstand nitrosative stress, which is particularly high in the oral cavity, the mechanisms allowing for protection against such stress are not known in this organism. In this study, microarray analysis of P. gingivalis transcriptional response to nitrite and nitric oxide showed drastic upregulation of the PG0893 gene coding for hybrid cluster protein (Hcp), which is a putative hydroxylamine reductase. Although regulation of hcp has been shown to be OxyR dependent in Escherichia coli, here we show that in P. gingivalis its expression is dependent on the Fnr-like regulator designated HcpR. Growth of the isogenic mutant V2807, containing an ermF-ermAM insertion within the hcpR (PG1053) gene, was significantly reduced in the presence of nitrite (P < 0.002) and nitric oxide-generating nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) (P < 0.001), compared to that of the wild-type W83 strain. Furthermore, the upregulation of PG0893 (hcp) was abrogated in V2807 exposed to nitrosative stress. In addition, recombinant HcpR bound DNA containing the hcp promoter sequence, and the binding was hemin dependent. Finally, V2807 was not able to survive with host cells, demonstrating that HcpR plays an important role in P. gingivalis virulence. This work gives insight into the molecular mechanisms of protection against nitrosative stress in P. gingivalis and shows that the regulatory mechanisms differ from those in E. coli.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS stimulates the expression of LPS-binding protein in  human oral keratinocytes in vitro.
AB  - LPS-binding protein (LBP) functions as a crucial molecule in innate immune responses to bacterial challenge. Our study has shown the expression of LBP in human gingiva and its significant association with periodontal health and disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key pathogen of periodontal disease. P. gingivalis LPS as a main virulence factor is strongly involved in periodontal pathogenesis and it displays a significant lipid A structural heterogeneity. Currently, it remains unknown whether, and to what extent, the lipid A structural heterogeneity of P. gingivalis LPS affects LBP expression. The present study investigated the expression profile of LBP in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) stimulated by two isoforms of P. gingivalis LPS [tetra- (LPS(1435/1449)) and penta-acylated (LPS(1690))] and Escherichia coli LPS, and the involvement of TLRs in LBP expression. The results showed that the expression of LBP mRNA and peptide was significantly up-regulated by P. gingivalis LPS(1690) and E. coli LPS, while P. gingivalis LPS(1435/1449) did not affect LBP expression. Blocking assay and siRNA gene silencing revealed that P. gingivalis LPS(1690)-induced LBP expression was through both TLR2 and TLR4. This in vitro study demonstrates that P. gingivalis LPS with a lipid A structural heterogeneity differentially modulates LBP expression in HOKs.
TI  - Effects of aging on endotoxin tolerance induced by lipopolysaccharides derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a bacterially induced chronic inflammatory disease.  Exposure of the host to periodontal pathogens and their virulence factors induces a state of hyporesponsiveness to subsequent stimulations, termed endotoxin tolerance. Aging has a profound effect on immune response to bacteria challenge. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of aging on endotoxin tolerance induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS in murine peritoneal macrophages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied the cytokine production (TNF-alpha and IL-10) and Toll-like receptor 2, 4 (TLR2, 4) gene and protein expressions in peritoneal macrophages from young (2-month-old) and middle-aged (12-month-old) ICR mice following single or repeated P. gingivalis LPS or E. coli LPS stimulation. Pretreatment of peritoneal macrophages with P. gingivalis LPS or E. coli LPS resulted in a reduction in TNF-alpha production and an increase in IL-10 production upon secondary stimulation (p<0.05), and the markedly lower levels of TNF-alpha and higher levels of IL-10 were observed in macrophages from young mice compared with those from middle-aged mice (p<0.05). In addition, LPS restimulations also led to the significantly lower expression levels of TLR2, 4 mRNA and protein in macrophages from young mice (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Repeated LPS stimulations triggered endotoxin tolerance in peritoneal macrophages and the ability to develop tolerance in young mice was more excellent. The impaired ability to develop endotoxin tolerance resulted from aging might be related to TLR2, 4 and might lead to the incontrollable periodontal inflammation in older adults.
TI  - Lysine substitutions convert a bacterial-agglutinating peptide into a bactericidal peptide that retains anti-lipopolysaccharide activity and low hemolytic activity.
AB  - GL13NH2 is a bacteria-agglutinating peptide derived from the sequence of the salivary protein parotid secretory protein (PSP, BPIFA2, SPLUNC2, C20orf70). The peptide agglutinates both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, and shows anti-lipopolysaccharide activity in vitro and in vivo. However, GL13NH2 does not exhibit bactericidal activity. To generate a more cationic peptide with potential bactericidal activity, three amino acid residues were replaced with lysine residues to generate the peptide GL13K. In this report, the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of GL13K were characterized. GL13K had lost the ability to agglutinate bacteria but gained bactericidal activity. Substitution of individual amino acids in GL13K with alanine did not restore bacterial agglutination. GL13K was bactericidal against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus gordonii and Escherichia coli but not Porphyromonas gingivalis. Unlike the agglutinating activity of GL13NH2, the bactericidal activity of GL13K against P. aeruginosa was retained in the presence of saliva. Both GL13NH2 and GL13K exhibited anti-lipopolysaccharide activity. In GL13K, this activity appeared to depend on a serine hydroxyl group. GL13K protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis and the peptide exhibited a low level of hemolysis, suggesting that it may be suitable for in vivo application.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces miR-146a without altering the production of inflammatory cytokines.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral Gram-negative bacterium, acts as a virulence factor for periodontal disease. Although P. gingivalis LPS does not induce proinflammatory cytokines as strongly as Escherichia coli LPS, it is still able to exploit negative Toll-like receptor (TLR) regulatory pathways and facilitate pathogen persistence. Recent reports suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) are also involved in the regulation of TLR signaling. Here, we demonstrate that P. gingivalis LPS strongly induces miRNA-146a expression in THP-1 cells and THP-1-derived macrophages. However, the inhibition or overexpression of miR-146a, through the transfection of a specific inhibitor or precursor, respectively, had little effect on cytokine production in macrophages stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS. Moreover, the expression of interleukin-1 associated-kinase-1 (IRAK-1) and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), potential target molecules of miR-146a, were not affected by the stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS. Because TLR signaling induces various negative regulators, these results call into question the role of miR-146a in cells stimulated with TLR ligands.
TI  - Functional importance of estrogen receptors in the periodontium.
AB  - The main functions of estrogen are associated with reproduction. However, estrogen has been shown to be of functional importance also in non-classic target organs. Previous studies, especially epidemiologic and clinical ones, have addressed estrogen's influence on periodontitis, suggesting that estrogen has a beneficial effect, but the biological mechanisms have not been identified. Estrogen exerts genomic effects in the target cells by binding to the nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor (ERs), ERalpha and ERbeta. The expression of the two subtypes of ERs varies depending on the tissue. The overall objectives of this thesis were to study the functional importance of estrogen receptors in the periodontium with special focus on inflammation, and stimulators of inflammation and their signaling pathways. The thesis is based on the following five papers. In Paper I, effects of estrogen on E. coli LPS-induced PDL cell production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are assessed, by using ELISA. Furthermore, effects of LPS and estrogen on the normal characteristics of the PDL cell such as collagen synthesis and cell proliferation is determined by using L-[3H]proline incorporation and measurement of DNA synthesis, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: E. coli LPS stimulates PDL cell IL-6 and MCP-1 production but has no effect on the normal physiological properties of PDL cells. LPS-induced IL-6 and MCP-1 is not reversed by estrogen suggesting that estrogen has no anti-inflammatory effect in these experiments. In Paper II, we investigate the effects of ovariectomy and aging on tooth attachment in female mice by using morphometric analysis. KEY FINDINGS: Withdrawal of female sex hormone production by ovariectomy has no effect on alveolar bone height and apical termination of the junctional epithelium. In a second series of experiments these parameters are similar in mice sacrificed at 8-26 weeks of age, suggesting that tooth attachment is preserved with age in mice within a period of six months. In Paper III, the objective is to investigate the regulation of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, and CCL5/RANTES chemokines by estrogen in human PDL cells by determining mRNA transcript levels (using quantitative real-time PCR) and protein levels (using ELISA). KEY FINDINGS: A physiological concentration of estrogen reduces the expression of CCL3 mRNA by about 40% compared to PDL cells treated with LPS alone. In contrast, inter-individual differences in the effects of estrogen on CCL5 mRNA expression are observed. These findings indicate that estrogen affects chemokine expression in PDL cells showing a complex pattern involving down-regulation as well as up-regulation of chemokines. Estrogen exerts both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects through these mechanisms. In Paper IV, ER expression in human gingival biopsies, and effects of estrogen on cultured gingival epithelial cell (HGEP) proliferation, are investigated. Expression of ERalpha and ERbeta is determined by immunohistochemistry and effects of estrogen on HGEP proliferation monitored by measuring DNA synthesis. KEY FINDINGS: HGEP cells show strong ERbeta immunoreactivity but low ERalpha immunoreactivity both in vivo and in culture, suggesting that ERbeta is the predominant ER subtype in HGEP. High, but not low, concentrations of estrogen attenuates proliferation of gingival epithelial cells, indicating a concentration-dependent mechanism. In Paper V, the objective is to investigate the effects of LPS from Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis on IL-6 production in human PDL cells and endothelial cells, and the signaling mechanisms involved. Quantitative real-time PCR is used to determine IL-6 mRNA levels and ELISA to determine IL-6 protein. KEY FINDINGS: E. coli LPS (but not P. gingivalis LPS) stimulates IL-6 production in PDL cells. Treatment with the non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME reduces IL-6 by 30%, while aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, does not affect IL-6 levels, showing a mechanism probably involving nitric oxide formation via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Treatment with the glucocorticoid steroid dexamethasone totally prevents-E. coli LPS-induced IL-6 in PDL cells.
TI  - Specificity of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. Because of observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic LPS, the authors hypothesized that LL-37 had specificity to neutralize such LPS activity. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate the LPS-neutralizing activity of LL-37 to various periodontopathogenic LPS in interleukin-8 (IL-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. METHODS: Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) and gingival fibroblasts (GF) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. After cell confluence in 24-well plates, LPS (10 mug/mL) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without LL-37 (10 mug/mL). After 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in IL-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: All periodontopathogenic LPS statistically significantly induced IL-8 production in both PDLF and GF (P <0.01). After neutralization with LL-37, both PDLF and GF showed a statistically significant reduction in IL-8 production compared with LPS-treated groups without LL-37 (P <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in IL-8 production in PDLF appeared to be higher than in GF. In addition, the percentage of reduction in IL-8 production varied considerably according to each periodontopathogenic LPS. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic LPS-induced IL-8 production in both PDLF and GF. Its LPS-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic LPS and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within LPS between different genera.
TI  - Characterization of FimA in Porphyromonas gingivalis genotype IV.
AB  - It has been reported that a large majority of periodontitis patients carry organisms with either type II or IV-fimA, while type I is the most prevalent fimA genotype among Porphyromonas gingivalis-positive healthy adults. Here we report characterization of recombinant fimbrial protein (rFimA) produced in Escherichia coli from genotype IV-fimA. In SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis after partial dissociation, type IV-rFimA showed a ladder-like pattern representing oligomeric/polymeric forms of native fimbrial structure. Unlike anti-type I-native fimbriae which can only recognize conformational epitopes of the respective proteins, both anti-type IV-native fimbriae and anti-type IV-rFimA antibodies recognized conformational as well as linear epitopes in type IV-fimbriae. These results suggest that the type IV-rFimA proteins retain the native fimbrial antigenicity and the antigenicity of type IV-fimbriae is different from that of type I-fimbriae.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  - Pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., Fusobacterium spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella species. A subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. For 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin MBC was within two doubling dilutions of the MIC. For the remaining strains, the MIC and MBC were within three to four doubling dilutions. Pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the MBC was equal to the MIC for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. As pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/mL. The bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as low as 0.125 mug/mL. In conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of MBC and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. It is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. These data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.
TI  - Role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in Porphyromonas gingivalis  lipopolysaccharide-induced VCAM-1 expression in human aortic endothelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been reported to induce the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in vascular endothelial cells. This finding suggests the potential roles for Pg in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism involved in Pg LPS-induced VCAM-1 production in endothelial cells remains unclear. METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used, respectively, to investigate the mRNA expression and protein production of VCAM-1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) induced by Pg LPS. The involvement of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) cell signaling pathway in VCAM-1 expression was investigated by assays with specific inhibitors. RESULTS: Pg LPS-induced expression in HAECs of VCAM-1 occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) significantly attenuated Pg LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression. CONCLUSION: Activation of p38 MAPK is at least partially involved in Pg LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression in HAECs, which may contribute to the acceleration of atherosclerosis.
TI  - Both the unique and repeat regions of the Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutin A  are involved in adhesion and invasion of host cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major etiologic agents of adult periodontitis and has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. It expresses multiple hemagglutinins that are significant virulence factors and play an important role in bacterial attachment and invasion of host cells. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of P. gingivalis hemagglutinin A (HagA) on the attachment to and invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and gingival epithelial cells (GEC). Bacterial strains expressing the HagA protein (or subunits), including Escherichia coli carrying plasmid pEKS5, E. coli carrying plasmid ST2, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium with plasmid pNM1.1 were used in this study. The strains were tested for their ability to attach to and invade HCAEC and GEC using antibiotic protection assays. In addition, the unique 5' N-terminal non-repeated segment of HagA was purified in recombinant form and a monoclonal antibody was created against the polypeptide. The monoclonal antibody against the unique portion of HagA was tested for inhibitory activity in these assays. The attachment of both E. coli strains expressing HagA fragment to host cells was significantly increased compared to their respective controls. However, they did not invade GEC or HCAEC. Interestingly, HagA expression in the Salmonella strain increased both adherence to and invasion of HCAEC, which may be due to the presence of the entire hagA ORF. A monoclonal antibody against the unique 5' N-terminal portion of HagA reduced invasion. Further experiments are needed to determine the role of the unique and the repeat segments of P. gingivalis HagA.
TI  - Sublingual vaccination with fusion protein consisting of the functional domain of hemagglutinin A of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein elicits protective immunity in the oral cavity.
AB  - This study demonstrated that sublingual immunization with a fusion protein, 25k-hagA-MBP, which consists of a 25-kDa antigenic region of hemagglutinin A purified from Porphyromonas gingivalis fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) originating from Escherichia coli as an adjuvant, elicited protective immune responses. Immunization with 25k-hagA-MBP induced high levels of antigen-specific serum IgG and IgA, as well as salivary IgA. High level titers of serum IgG and IgA were also induced for almost 1 year. In an IgG subclass analysis, sublingual immunization with 25k-hagA-MBP induced both IgG1 and IgG2b antibody responses. Additionally, numerous antigen-specific IgA antibody-forming cells were detected from the salivary gland 7 days after the final immunization. Mononuclear cells isolated from submandibular lymph nodes (SMLs) showed significant levels of proliferation upon restimulation with 25k-hagA-MBP. An analysis of cytokine responses showed that antigen-specific mononuclear cells isolated from SMLs produced significantly high levels of IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta. These results indicate that sublingual immunization with 25k-hagA-MBP induces efficient protective immunity against P. gingivalis infection in the oral cavity via Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine production.
TI  - [Effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis with different fimA genotypes on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 production by human umbilical vein endothelial cells].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) with different fimA genotypes on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) production by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). METHODS: In the present study, PgATCC33277 (type I fimA genotype), WCSP 115 (type II fimA genotype), W83 (type IV fimA genotype), and Escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (Ec-LPS) were designed as experimental group 1, 2, 3, and positive control group, respectively, to stimulate HUVEC, and the un-stimulated HUVEC were analyzed as negative control group. The three strains of Pg were cultured anaerobically in standard condition, and then the Pg cells and Ec-LPS were co-cultured with HUVEC for 2, 6, and 24 h, respectively. The amount of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 produced by HUVEC was detected with flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by HUVEC were assayed with confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). RESULTS: The expression of ICAM-1 on the surface of HUVEC were intensified after infected by Pg with I, II, and IV fimA genotypes (P < 0.05). The amounts of ICAM-1 were 60.27 +/- 5.43, 80.81 +/- 1.44, and 85.94 +/- 2.56 for Pg with type I fimA genotype, 86.69 +/- 8.81, 90.19 +/- 0.00, and 96.18 +/- 0.48 for Pg with type II fimA genotype, 59.66 +/- 0.40, 85.79 +/- 4.86, and 96.04 +/- 2.07 for Pg with type IV fimA genotype at 2, 6 and 24 h after infection, respectively. The up-regulation effects caused by Pg with type II and IV fimA genotypes were stronger than those caused by Pg with type I fimA genotype at different time points except at 2 h (P < 0.05). Under the present experimental condition, infected by Pg with type I, II and IV fimA genotypes stimulated low expression of VCAM-1 by HUVEC, it showed no significant differences among all the groups (P > 0.05). Expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in Pg infected HUVEC were confirmed by CLSM. Infection of HUVEC with Pg resulted in more fluorescence staining of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 compared with that in uninfected HUVEC cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The virulence and pathogenicity of Pg is associated with its fimA genotypes, Pg with type II and IV fimA genes possess stronger ability to stimulate HUVEC to up-regulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules, which may lead to disorders in vascular endothelial function.
TI  - Diode laser activated indocyanine green selectively kills bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Commercially available photodynamic therapy for periodontal diseases utilizes methylene blue as a photosensitizer. Here we propose a novel photosensitizer dye, indocyanine green (ICG), because it can be readily activated by commercially available dental 810 nm diode lasers and has an established safety record as an intravascular agent in cardiac imaging and ophthalmologic photodynamic therapy. Therefore, we aim to characterize ICG uptake and killing of key periodontal pathogens to explore its potential as a periodontal photodynamic therapy agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested ICG uptake by spectroscopy in Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, in addition to Escherichia coli DH5alpha and a human gingival epithelial cell line, HepG, in relation to ICG dose and exposure time. We then measured killing of bacteria by determining viable bacteria counts before and after exposure to ICG and 810 nm diode laser light (0-0.5 W output settings, 0-5 seconds). ICG was also applied to extracted, restored teeth, and the teeth inspected visually for staining after rinsing with saline. RESULTS: We found rapid and significant uptake of indocyanine green into P. gingivalis 381 and A. actinomycetemcomitans 67, compared to E. coli DH5alpha and HepG gingival cell line. This correlated with significant killing of strains 381 and 67 compared to E.coli, with less than 10% survival. ICG does not appear to stain tooth surfaces and materials except calculus. CONCLUSION: ICG combined with an 810 nm diode laser may be useful as a photodynamic adjunct for reduction of bacterial load in periodontal pockets.
TI  - The elicitation step of nickel allergy is promoted in mice by microbe-related substances, including some from oral bacteria.
AB  - Microbial components activate the host's innate immunity via interactions with molecules including TLRs and NODs. We previously reported that in mice (i) Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; TLR4 agonist) promotes Ni-allergy even in T-cell-deficient mice, (ii) E. coli LPS reduces the minimum allergy-inducing concentrations of Ni at both the sensitization and elicitation steps, and (iii) various microbe-related substances promote sensitization to Ni. Here, we examined the effects of microbe-related substances at the elicitation step. Mice (except for TLR4-mutated C3H/HeJ mice) were sensitized to Ni by intraperitoneal injection of NiCl(2) + E. coli LPS. Ten days later their ear-pinnas were challenged with 1 muM NiCl(2) with or without a test substance. Although NiCl(2) alone at this concentration does not induce Ni-allergy, its combination with the following substances induced Ni-allergy in BALB/c mice: LPS preparations from oral gram-negative bacteria (Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis), a mannan preparation from a fungus (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and synthetic NOD2 and TLR2 agonists. The effect of the mannan preparation was small in C3H/HeJ mice (sensitized with NiCl(2) + the P. intermedia preparation). The P. intermedia preparation promoted Ni-allergy in C3H/HeJ and nude mice, but not in mice deficient in either TLR2 or histidine decarboxylase. Intragingival injection of the P. intermedia preparation and later challenge with NiCl(2) alone to ear-pinnas also promoted Ni-allergy. These results indicate that (i) in Ni-allergy, a microbial milieu or innate immunity is important at the elicitation step, too, and (ii) some oral bacteria may promote Ni-allergy via TLR2-stimulant(s) production.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide lipid A heterogeneity differentially  modulates the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - AIM: Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) displays a significant amount of structural heterogeneity, containing both tetra- (LPS(1435/1449) ) and penta-acylated (LPS(1690) ) lipid A structures. This study investigated the effects of the two isoforms of P. gingivalis LPS on the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: HGFs were stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS(1435/1449) and LPS(1690) in both dose- (1 ng-10 mug/ml) and time-dependent (2-48 h) experiments. Total RNA and protein were extracted and used for analysis of the IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha transcripts as well as IL-6 and IL-8 proteins, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: P. gingivalis LPS(1690) significantly up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of IL-6 and IL-8, whereas P. gingivalis LPS(1435/1449) did not induce significant host response. The expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8 up-regulated by P. gingivalis LPS(1690) continuously increased with time course. In contrast, TNF-alpha transcript expression was up-regulated promptly by P. gingivalis LPS(1690) after 2 h of stimulation and gradually declined afterwards. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that P. gingivalis LPS heterogeneity may differentially modulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in HGFs, which may contribute to periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Altered Toll-like receptor 2-mediated endotoxin tolerance is related to diminished interferon beta production.
AB  - Induction of endotoxin tolerance leads to a reduced inflammatory response after repeated challenge by LPS and is important for resolution of inflammation and prevention of tissue damage. Enterobacterial LPS is recognized by the TLR4 signaling complex, whereas LPS of some non-enterobacterial organisms is capable of signaling independently of TLR4 utilizing TLR2-mediated signal transduction instead. In this study we report that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS, a TLR2 agonist, fails to induce a fully endotoxin tolerant state in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. In contrast to significantly decreased production of human IL-8 and TNF-alpha and, in mice, keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and TNF-alpha after repeated challenge with Escherichia coli LPS, cells repeatedly exposed to P. gingivalis LPS responded by producing less TNF-alpha but sustained elevated secretion of IL-8, KC, and MIP-2. Furthermore, in endotoxin-tolerant cells, production of IL-8 is controlled at the signaling level and correlates well with NF-kappaB activation, whereas TNF-alpha expression is blocked at the gene transcription level. Interferon beta plays an important role in attenuation of chemokine expression in endotoxin-tolerized cells as shown in interferon regulatory factor-3 knock-out mice. In addition, human gingival fibroblasts, commonly known not to display LPS tolerance, were found to be tolerant to repeated challenge by LPS if pretreated with interferon beta. The data suggest that the inability of the LPS-TLR2 complex to induce full endotoxin tolerance in monocytes/macrophages is related to diminished production of interferon beta and may partly explain the involvement of these LPS isoforms in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases.
TI  - [Cloning of the glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene of porphyromonas gingivalis and its expression in E. coli].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone the glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and to induce its fusion expression in E. coli. METHODS: GAPDH was obtained by PCR and was inserted into cloning vector pMD-18-T to construct clone recon. Double enzymes digest the recon pMD18-T-GAPDH and the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a and then connect to get the expressing recon pET-32a-GAPDH. The recombinant expression plasmid which had been confirmed by enzymes digestion was transformed to E. coli competent cells BL21 and induced the expression of GAPDH with isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) of different density. RESULTS: DNA sequencing showed that the fragment was 99.802% the same to the sequence published in NCBI. Under the best density, IPTG could be highly expressed. CONCLUSION: The GAPDH had been successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli which gets ready for the following experiment to study the immunity of GAPDH and the homologues antibody preparation.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis mutY is involved in the repair of oxidative stress-induced DNA mispairing.
AB  - The ability for DNA mismatch repair, after oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, is critical for the persistence of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the inflammatory environment of the periodontal pocket. Our previous report demonstrated that, in contrast to other organisms, the repair of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage involving 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) may occur by a yet-to-be described mechanism in P. gingivalis. 8-oxoG does not block DNA replication; rather, it mispairs with adenine, which can be repaired by the MutY glycosylase. To determine the function of the P. gingivalis MutY homologue in DNA repair, it was insertionally inactivated using the ermF-ermAM antibiotic cassette and used to create a mutY-deficient mutant (FLL147) by allelic exchange mutagenesis. FLL147 had an increased rate of spontaneous mutation and was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide compared with the wild-type W83 strain. DNA oligomers containing a site-specific 8-oxoG:A mispair was repaired similarly in both the P. gingivalis mutY-defective mutant and wild-type strains. The P. gingivalis mutY homologue was shown to complement the mutY mutation in Escherichia coli. In a gel mobility shift assay, the purified recombinant MutY is able to bind an oligo containing an 8-oxoG:A mispair. Taken together, MutY may play the expected role in oxidative stress resistance in P. gingivalis. However, there may exist other redundant mechanism(s) for the removal of 8-oxoG:A mismatch in this organism.
TI  - The possible mechanism of preterm birth associated with periodontopathic Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that Porphyromonas gingivalis is found in the amniotic fluid and placentae of pregnant women with some obstetric diseases. However, the biological effects of P. gingivalis on intrauterine tissues remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of P. gingivalis in chorionic tissues from hospitalized high-risk pregnant women, and the effects of P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide on the production of proinflammatory molecules in human chorion-derived cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three subjects were selected from Japanese hospitalized high-risk pregnant women. The presence of P. gingivalis in chorionic tissues was analyzed by PCR. Cultured chorion-derived cells or Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) gene-silenced chorion-derived cells were stimulated with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate TLR-2 and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) mRNA expression in the cells. Levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in culture supernatants of the chorion-derived cells were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: P. gingivalis DNA was detected in chorionic tissues from two women with threatened preterm labor, two with multiple pregnancy and two with placenta previa. Stimulation of chorion-derived cells with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide significantly increased TLR-2 mRNA expression, whereas TLR-4 mRNA expression was not changed. P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induced interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 production in chorion-derived cells, but the P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 production was reduced in TLR-2 gene-silenced chorion-derived cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that P. gingivalis can be detected in chorionic tissues of hospitalized high-risk pregnant women, and that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 production via TLR-2 in chorion-derived cells.
TI  - Short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (SZ) to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC #25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC #29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC#25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC #27853), Candida albicans (ATCC #90028), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC #33277), Actinomyces israelii (ATCC #12102), and Prevotella intermedia (ATCC# 15032). SZ was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to MTA powder. The control group was MTA powder with no SZ. The antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed MTA specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. The amounts of silver ion release from MTA specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. The pH of MTA specimens was measured with a pH meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. MTA with 2% and 0.2% SZ specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for P. intermedia and A. israelii. MTA without SZ inhibited C. albicans, E. Coli, and P. intermedia. The highest silver release was detected in 2% SZ MTA at 24 h. The incorporation of SZ may enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA.
TI  - Classification
AB  - Bacteria are classified and identified to distinguish one organism from another and to group similar organisms by criteria of interest to microbiologists or other scientists. The most important level of this type of classification is the species level. A species name should mean the same thing to everyone. Within one species, strains and subgroups can differ by the disease they produce, their environmental habitat, and many other characteristics. Formerly, species were created on the basis of such criteria, which may be extremely important for clinical microbiologists and physicians but which are not a sufficient basis for establishing a species. Verification of existing species and creation of new species should involve biochemical and other phenotypic criteria as well as DNA relatedness. In numerical or phenetic approaches to classification, strains are grouped on the basis of a large number of phenotypic characteristics. DNA relatedness is used to group strains on the basis of overall genetic similarity. Species are identified in the clinical laboratory by morphological traits and biochemical tests, some of which are supplemented by serologic assessments (e.g., identification of Salmonella and Shigella species). Because of differences in pathogenicity (Escherichia coli) or the necessity to characterize a disease outbreak (Vibrio cholerae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), strains of medical interest are often classified below the species level by serology or identification of toxins. Pathogenic or epidemic strains also can be classified by the presence of a specific plasmid, by their plasmid profile (the number and sizes of plasmids), or by bacteriophage susceptibility patterns (phage typing). Newer molecular biologic techniques have enabled scientists to identify some species and strains (without the use of biochemical tests) by identifying a specific gene or genetic sequence, sometimes directly from the clinical specimen. Laboratories have no difficulty in identifying typical strains of common bacteria using commonly available test systems. Problems do arise, however, when atypical strains or rare or newly described species are not in the data base. Such difficulties are compounded when the strains are misidentified rather than unidentified, and so laboratory personnel and physicians (at least infectious diseases specialists) should be familiar with taxonomic reference texts and journals that publish papers on new species. Bacterial nomenclature at the genus and species level changes often, based primarily on the use of newer genetic techniques. A species may acquire more than one name. In some cases the recognition of a new species results in a unique correlation with specific clinical problems. For example, recognition of Porphyromonas gingivalis as a unique species, separate from its previous inclusion within Bacteroides melaninogenicus (now known to be composed of several taxonomic groups of black-pigmenting anaerobic gram-negative bacilli), elucidated its role as a key pathogen in adult periodontitis. It is important to understand why these changes and synonyms exist in taxonomy. The clinical laboratory is concerned with the rapid, sensitive, and accurate identification of microbes involved in producing disease. The number and types of tests done in such a laboratory depend on its size and the population it serves. Highly specialized or rarely performed tests should be done only by reference laboratories. Physicians, clinical laboratory personnel, and reference laboratory personnel must have a good working relationship if patients are to receive first-rate care. In addition, the physician and the clinical laboratory personnel must know which diseases and isolates are reportable to public health laboratories and how to report them .
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Stimulants of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 are elevated in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects.
AB  - AIM: Because the absorption of stimulants of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 from the gastrointestinal tract into the circulation has been proposed to promote the development of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, we aimed to quantify the abundance of stimulants of TLR2 and TLR4 in human saliva. METHODS: A recently developed bioassay based upon measurement of NF-kappaB activation in TLR-deficient human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells transfected with human TLR2 or TLR4 and calibrated with synthetic bacterial lipopeptide (Pam(3) CSK(4) ) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was used to establish the normal range of TLR stimulants in saliva of 20 healthy subjects and 20 subjects with periodontal disease. RESULTS: Median soluble stimulants of TLR2 and TLR4 were significantly higher in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with saliva of healthy subjects; 3450 versus 77 ng/ml Pam(3) CSK(4) equivalents (p<0.0001) and 138 versus 7 ng/ml LPS equivalents, respectively (p<0.0001). Salivary TLR stimulant levels remained relatively stable in healthy subjects over several days. Six strains of oral Gram-negative bacteria, including Tannerella forsythensis, Lysobacter enzymogenes, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella oris and Porphyromonas gingivalis, from a panel of nine examined did not stimulate TLR4-dependent signalling. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated salivary TLR stimulants may represent a novel mechanism by which periodontitis increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance.
TI  - The bcp gene in the bcp-recA-vimA-vimE-vimF operon is important in oxidative stress resistance in Porphyromonas gingivalis W83.
AB  - The ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to overcome oxidative stress in the inflammatory environment of the periodontal pocket is critical for its survival. We have previously demonstrated that the recA locus, which carries the bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (bcp) gene and has a unique genetic architecture, plays a role in virulence regulation and oxidative stress resistance in P. gingivalis. To further characterize the bcp gene, which was confirmed to be part of the bcp-recA-vimA-vimE-vimF operon, we created a P. gingivalis bcp-defective isogenic mutant (FLL302) by allelic exchange. Compared with the wild-type, FLL302 had a similar growth rate, black pigmentation, beta-hemolysis and UV sensitivity. Although there was no change in the distribution of gingipain activity, there was a 30% reduction in both Arg-X and Lys-X activities in the mutant strain compared with the wild-type. When exposed to 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide, P. gingivalis FLL302 was more sensitive than the wild-type. In addition, the cloned P. gingivalis bcp gene increased resistance to 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide in a bcp-defective Escherichia coli mutant. The mutant also demonstrated decreased aerotolerance when compared with the wild-type. Porphyromonas gingivalis FLL302 and the wild-type strain had similar virulence profiles in a mouse model of virulence. These observations suggest that the bcp gene may play a role in oxidative stress resistance but has a decreased functional significance in the pathogenic potential of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Nasal immunization with a fusion protein consisting of the hemagglutinin A antigenic region and the maltose-binding protein elicits CD11c(+) CD8(+) dendritic cells for induced long-term protective immunity.
AB  - We assessed the efficacy of a fusion protein consisting of the 25-kDa antigenic region of Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin A and the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (25k-hagA-MBP) as a nasal vaccine for the prevention of oral infection with P. gingivalis. Nasal immunization with 25k-hagA-MBP induced high levels of 25k-hagA-specific serum IgG, serum IgA, and salivary IgA antibodies in a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent manner. These antibody responses were maintained for at least 1 year after immunization. Analysis of cytokine responses showed that nasal administration of 25k-hagA-MBP induced antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells producing interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-5, but not gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), in the spleen and cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). Furthermore, increased numbers of CD11c(+) CD8alpha(+), but not CD11c(+) CD11b(+) or CD11c(+) B220(+), dendritic cells with upregulated expression of CD80, CD86, CD40, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules were noted in the spleen, CLNs, and nasopharynx-associated lymphoreticular tissues (NALT). Interestingly, when 25k-hagA-MBP or cholera toxin (CT) was given intranasally to enable examination of their presence in neuronal tissues, the amounts of 25k-hagA-MBP were significantly lower than those of CT. Importantly, mice given 25k-hagA-MBP nasally showed a significant reduction in alveolar bone loss caused by oral infection with P. gingivalis, even 1 year after the immunization. These results suggest that 25k-hagA-MBP administered nasally would be an effective and safe mucosal vaccine against P. gingivalis infection and may be an important tool for the prevention of chronic periodontitis in humans.
TI  - Recombinant Porphyromonas gingivalis FimA preproprotein expressed in Escherichia  coli is lipidated and the mature or processed recombinant FimA protein forms a short filament in vitro.
AB  - The gram-negative anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is an etiologically important pathogen for chronic periodontal diseases in adults. Our previous study suggested that the major structural components of both Fim and Mfa fimbriae in this organism are secreted through their lipidated precursors. In this study, we constructed Escherichia coli strains expressing various fimA genes with or without the 5'-terminal DNA region encoding the signal peptide, and we determined whether lipidation of recombinant FimA proteins occurred in E. coli. Lipidation occurred for a recombinant protein from the fimA gene with the 5'-terminal DNA region encoding the signal peptide but not for a recombinant protein from the fimA gene without the signal-peptide-encoding region, as revealed by [3H]palmitic acid labeling experiments. A TLR2-dependent signaling response was induced by the recombinant protein from the fimA gene with the signal-peptide-encoding region but not by a recombinant protein from the fimA gene with the signal-peptide-encoding region that had a base substitution causing an amino acid substitution (C19A). Electron microscopic analysis revealed that recombinant FimA (A-47 - W-383) protein was autopolymerized to form filamentous structures of about 80 nm in length in vitro. The results suggest that FimA protein, a major subunit of Fim fimbriae, is transported to the outer membrane by the lipoprotein sorting system, and a mature or processed FimA protein on the outer membrane is autopolymerized to form Fim fimbriae.
TI  - The lipid A phosphate position determines differential host Toll-like receptor 4  responses to phylogenetically related symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The human symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron promotes intestinal function and  health, whereas the phylogenetically related pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with the chronic oral inflammatory disease periodontitis. Although both B. thetaiotaomicron and P. gingivalis synthesize lipopolysaccharides (LPS) consisting of penta-acylated, monophosphorylated lipid A in addition to immunologically silent, nonphosphorylated lipid A, they elicit strikingly distinct Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) responses. We show that the phosphate position of penta-acylated, monophosphorylated lipid A is a key feature for determining the differential TLR4 responses elicited by these evolutionarily related bacteria. B. thetaiotaomicron produces TLR4-stimulatory lipid A bearing a 1-phosphate, in contrast to P. gingivalis, which produces TLR4-evasive lipid A bearing a 4'-phosphate. Confirming these observations, recombinant Escherichia coli LPS containing penta-acylated, 1-phosphorylated lipid A is more TLR4 stimulatory than LPS containing 4'-phosphorylated lipid A. The specific capacity of a Gram-negative bacterium to alert or evade the host innate immune defense system through TLR4-dependent signaling is currently recognized as a critical aspect defining the relationship between the host and the bacterium. We propose that the distinct lipid A phosphate positions observed for the B. thetaiotaomicron and P. gingivalis LPS contributes to the manifestation of these bacteria as commensal or pathogen within the human host.
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.
TI  - Differential cytokine patterns in mouse macrophages and gingival fibroblasts after stimulation with porphyromonas gingivalis or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major cause of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease is Porphyromonas gingivalis, a non-motile, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacterium. Within gingival tissue, both macrophages and fibroblasts participate in the immune response to foreign entities by releasing cytokines and expressing molecules to recruit and activate lymphocytes. However, the contribution of gingival macrophages and fibroblasts to the immune response to P. gingivalis infection is not fully known. METHODS: The AMJ2-C8 cell line (AM cells), a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line, and ESK-1 cells, a mouse gingival fibroblast cell line made in our laboratory, were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from either P. gingivalis or Escherichia coli. The expression of immune response molecules was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunoassay. RESULTS: AM and ESK-1 cells responded differently to P. gingivalis and E. coli LPS stimulation. The ESK-1 gingival fibroblast cell line was more responsive to E. coli LPS stimulation as seen by elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, inducible nitric oxide, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression relative to stimulation by P. gingivalis LPS. Conversely, the AM macrophage cell line was more responsive to P. gingivalis LPS stimulation, particularly for interleukin IL-1beta, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, relative to stimulation by E. coli LPS. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that E. coli LPS induces a stronger cytokine and chemokine response in gingival fibroblasts, whereas P. gingivalis LPS induces a stronger response in macrophages.
TI  - Antibacterial coatings of fluoridated hydroxyapatite for percutaneous implants.
AB  - Percutaneous orthopedic and dental implants require not only good adhesion with bone but also the ability to attach and form seals with connective tissues and the skin. To solve the skin-seal problem of such implants, an electrochemical deposition method was used to modify the surfaces of metallic implants to improve their antibacterial ability and skin seals around them. A dense and uniform fluoridated calcium phosphate coating with a thickness of about 200 nm was deposited on an acid-etched pure titanium substrate by controlling the current density and reaction duration of the electrochemical process. The as-deposited amorphous fluoridated calcium phosphate transformed to fluoridated hydroxyapatite (FHA) after heat treatment at 600 degrees C in a water vapor environment for 3 h. Both single crystal diffraction patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images confirmed the phase of the fluoridated calcium phosphate after the heat treatment. The antibacterial activities of FHA coatings were tested against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) with the film attachment method. The antibacterial activity of FHA coating is much higher than that of pure hydroxyapatite (HA) coating and acid-etched pure titanium surface. The promising features of FHA coating make it suitable for orthopedic and dental applications.
TI  - Analysis of immune responses to purified recombinant antigens of periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The accumulating knowledge about host-pathogen interactions in infectious diseases shows how the immune system interfaces with pathogens, and thus, helps us in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases and improving their treatment. Purified antigens are indispensable while investigating the immune response in both innate and acquired immunities. It is ideal to use native antigens purified from the host organisms in native conditions that sustain their biological activity completely. However, purification of native antigens, especially on a large scale, is technically difficult and generally time consuming. Purifying protein as a peptide-tagged fusion protein is an effective approach. Purification of a recombinant protein engineered to incorporate a polyhistidine tag at either the carboxyl or amino terminus is an established method, and it can be easily modified to obtain optimal results under different conditions. Heat-shock proteins were highly conserved during evolution and are highly homologous between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Their molecular mimicry might have roles in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. We successfully generated histidine-tagged recombinant heat-shock proteins from the periodontopathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The recombinant proteins allowed us to evaluate the immune response to these antigens in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum regulation of neutrophil transcription.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Abnormal neutrophil responses have been observed in periodontitis patients, including hyper-reactivity in terms of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following exposure to the key quorum-sensing plaque bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum. This study was designed to characterize the transcriptional response of neutrophils to F. nucleatum. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peripheral blood neutrophils were exposed to F. nucleatum, and gene expression was analysed using high-throughput transcriptomics. RESULTS: Microarray technology demonstrated differential expression of 208 genes (163 increased and 43 decreased relative to control genes), which identified regulation of several ontological classes, including signal transduction (13%), transcription regulation (7%) and ROS response (14%). Individual gene expression analysis of selected transcripts, including CSF, CXCL3, FOS, HMOX1, HSP40, SOD2, NFKB2 and GP91, in individual and pooled RNA samples from control and F. nucleatum-exposed neutrophils corroborated microarray data. Analysis of ROS generation, combined with transcript analysis, in response to a panel of proinflammatory stimuli (F. nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and opsonized Staphylococcus aureus) identified significant differences in ROS and transcript regulatory control. Further analyses of neutrophils from periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy control subjects stimulated with F. nucleatum indicated significant differential induction of several ROS response-related transcripts. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that neutrophils are transcriptionally active in response to the periodontal pathogen F. nucleatum and that these changes in gene expression are likely to affect neutrophil function. The differential response of neutrophils to a range of stimuli combined with data demonstrating differences between patient and control neutrophils indicate the importance of this cell and its interaction with the local tissue environment in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.
TI  - [Construction of prokaryotic expression vector of FimA gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis, fusion expression and purification in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLyS].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone the FimA gene of fimbriae from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and to construct prokaryotic expression vector which was induced in E.coli BL21(DE3)pLyS in the form of fusion protein expression and to identify, purify the product of its expression. METHODS: To clone the FimA gene of fimbriae from P. gingivalis and to construct prokaryotic expression vector pET15b-FimA vector which was transformed into the competent cells of BL21(DE3)pLyS. The expression of fusion protein was induced by isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). With anti-6xHis Tag monoclonal antibody as the first antibody, the expressed fusion protein was characterized by Western blot and purified by Co(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography. RESULTS: Cloned FimA gene sequences and inserted into expression vector of the FimA sequences were related to the sequence in GenBank database showed 100% homology. IPTG induced and then identified by Western blot showed a fragment of 4.1 x 10(4) has been expressed. Co(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography column was used to obtain high concentrations of FimA purified protein. CONCLUSION: The recombinant prokaryotic expression vector of pET15b-FimA was constructed and was expressed and purified successfully in E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLyS. This study laid the experimental foundation to further prepare for monoclonal antibodies of fimbriae of P. gingivalis and to develop the subunit protein vaccine of prevention of periodontitis.
TI  - Differential host response to LPS variants in amniochorion and the TLR4/MD-2 system in Macaca nemestrina.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Microbial-specific factors are likely critical in determining whether bacteria trigger preterm labor. Structural variations in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram-negative bacteria, can determine whether LPS has an inflammatory (agonist) or anti-inflammatory (antagonist) effect through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Our objective was to determine whether amniochorion could discriminate between LPS variants in a nonhuman primate model. We also cloned Macaca nemestrina TLR4 and MD-2 and compared this complex functionally to the human homologue to establish whether nonhuman primates could be used to study TLR4 signaling in preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: Amniochorion explants from M. nemestrina were stimulated with a panel of LPS variants for 24 h. Supernatants were analyzed for IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha. Tissue expression of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, MyD88 and NF-kappaB was studied by RT-PCR. M. nemestrina TLR4 and MD-2 genes were cloned and compared with their human counterparts in a recombinant TLR4 signaling system to determine LPS sensitivity. RESULTS: LPS variants differentially stimulated cytokines and prostaglandins, which was not related to transcriptional changes of TLR4 or other TLRs. Nearly all elements of LPS binding and TLR4 leucine-rich repeats were conserved between humans and M. nemestrina. TLR4/MD-2 signaling complexes from both species were equally sensitive to LPS variants. CONCLUSIONS: LPS variants elicit a hierarchical inflammatory response within amniochorion that may contribute to preterm birth. LPS sensitivity is similar between M. nemestrina and humans, validating M. nemestrina as an appropriate model to study TLR4 signaling in preterm birth.
TI  - Study of the direct bactericidal effect of Nd:YAG and diode laser parameters used in endodontics on pigmented and nonpigmented bacteria.
AB  - Laser light can be used during endodontic procedures to sterilize the root canal  by destroying bacteria. Previous in-vitro studies that investigated the mechanism of the destruction of bacteria inhabiting the root canal by 1,064-nm Nd:YAG and 808-nm diode laser light used substrates that absorb light in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. These substrates heat the bacterial microenvironment, which possibly contributes to cell death. To determine the direct effect of laser light on the bacterial sample in the absence of detrimental heating, a sapphire substrate, which is virtually transparent in NIR spectrum, was inoculated with bacterial samples and subjected to laser irradiation at 1,064 nm (1.5 W, 15 Hz) and at 808 nm (1.5 W, 20 Hz). Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria were used. E. faecalis and E. coli were largely unaffected by laser light. The viability of P. gingivalis, a pigmented bacterium, was directly affected by both NIR wavelengths (a 57% decrease of viability at 1,064 nm and a 31% decrease at 808 nm). Our results indicate that the primary mediator of cell death appears to be the interaction between NIR laser light and the bacterial microenvironment, most likely in the form of heating. Our research suggests that when optimizing the efficacy of laser-assisted endodontic sterilization of the root canal, the optical characteristics of the bacterial microenvironment play a key role, as nonpigmented bacteria appear to be virtually transparent at 808 nm and 1,064 nm.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of bone sialoprotein gene by Porphyromonas gingivalis  lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major mediator of inflammatory response. Periodontopathic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS has quite different character from Escherichia coli LPS. E. coli LPS is agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), whereas P. gingivalis LPS worked as antagonist for TLR4. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an early marker of osteoblast differentiation. To investigate the effects of P. gingivalis LPS on BSP transcription, we used rat osteoblast-like ROS17/2.8 cells. BSP mRNA levels were decreased by 0.1 microg/ml and increased by 0.01 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS at 12 h. Results of luciferase assays showed that 0.1 microg/ml decreased and 0.01 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS increased BSP transcription in -116 to +60 BSP construct. The effects of P. gingivalis LPS were abrogated by double mutations in cAMP response element (CRE) and FGF2 response element (FRE). Tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A, ERK1/2 inhibitor and antioxidant N-acetylcystein inhibited effects of P. gingivalis LPS. Protein kinase A inhibitor and PI3-kinase/Akt inhibitor only abolished the effect of 0.01 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS. Furthermore, 0.1 microg/ml LPS decreased the CRE- and FRE-protein complexes formation, whereas 0.01 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS increased the nuclear protein binding to CRE and FRE. ChIP assays revealed increased binding of CREB1, JunD, Fra2, Runx2, Dlx5, and Smad1 to a chromatin fragment containing the CRE and FRE by 0.01 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS. These studies therefore indicated that 0.1 microg/ml suppressed, and 0.01 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS increased BSP gene transcription mediated through CRE and FRE elements in the rat BSP gene promoter.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cells by impedance spectra via fluidic electrodes in a microfluidic device.
AB  - In this study, a novel method for detecting bacterial cells in deionized (DI) water suspension is presented by using fluidic electrodes with a hydrodynamic focusing technique. KCl solution was utilized as both sheath flow and fluidic electrodes, and the bacterial suspension was squeezed to form three flowing layers with different conductivities on a microfluidic chip. An impedance analyzer was connected with the KCl solution through two Ag/AgCl wires to apply an AC voltage to fluidic layers within a certain frequency for impedance measurements. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli were detected and linear relationships were found between the impedance and the logarithmic value of the bacterial concentration in certain cell concentration ranges. It is demonstrated that bacterial detection using the microdevice is rapid and convenient, with a chip made of simple flow channels, and the detection sensitivity of cell counting can be tuned by varying the width of the sample flow layer through changing input velocities, showing a detection limit of 10(3) cells mL(-1).
TI  - Communication: Antimicrobial Activity of SMAP28 with a Targeting Domain for Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Antibiotic therapy is often used with mechanical therapy to treat periodontal disease. However, complications associated with antibiotic use can occur. A 'bacteria-specific' targeted approach would eliminate some of these complications and kill specific periodontopathogens without harming the commensal bacteria. One such approach is to couple antimicrobial peptides to a ligand, pheromone, or antibody specific for the periodontopathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we attached PQGPPQ, a peptide from proline-rich protein 1 to either the N-terminus of SMAP28 (peptide ZS37-37) or the C-terminus of SMAP28 (peptide ZS37-38) to see whether it has potential as a carrier ligand to deliver SMAP28 to the surface of P. gingivalis. For Escherichia coli and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the median minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ZS37-37 was higher than the median of SMAP28 alone, although the median MIC of ZS37-38 was lower than that of SMAP28 alone. For P. gingivalis, there was no difference in the median MIC values. For S. aureus, the median MIC was higher for ZS37-37 and ZS37-38 compared to SMAP28 alone, particularly for ZS37-38. For Fusobacterium nucleatum, the median MIC values were equal for ZS37-37 and ZS37-38 and higher than the median MIC for SMAP28 alone. Attaching PQGPPQ to SMAP28 did not greatly increase the antimicrobial activity of ZS37-37 or ZS37-38 for P. gingivalis nor substantially decrease the antimicrobial activity of ZS37-37 or ZS37-38 for the four other microorganisms tested. This is an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that has 'targeted' antimicrobial activity without adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Innate inflammatory responses of human decidual cells to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontopathic bacteria exert potent proinflammatory effects in human decidua. STUDY DESIGN: The immunostimulatory effects of Gram-positive and negative periodontopathic bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides were tested in human decidual cell cultures in comparison with Escherichia coli. Cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; inflammatory gene expression was measured by oligonucleotide arrays and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All bacteria that were tested elicited an inflammatory response, although concentration-dependence and efficacy varied considerably with organism and culture. Lipopolysaccharides were more potent stimuli than intact bacterial cells, although bacteria exerted greater effects at high concentrations. Of 112 genes on the arrays, 18 genes were stimulated significantly by one or more lipopolysaccharide preparation. CONCLUSION: The ability of periodontopathic bacteria to stimulate a decidual inflammatory response is highly variable and partly dependent on the presence and structure of constituent lipopolysaccharides. This adds to our understanding of the causal association between periodontal disease and preterm birth.
TI  - Studies on development of controlled delivery of combination drug(s) to periodontal pocket.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study to develop the controlled delivery of combination drug(s) to periodontal pocket. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present investigation mucoadhesive gel formulations were prepared using carboxy methylcellulose (CMC), methylcellulose (MC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP), polycarbophil (PC), and poloxamer. Each formulation was characterized in terms of polarizing light microscopy, gelation, gel melting, hardness, compressibility, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, syringeability, adhesion to a mucin disk, rheological studies, drug release, and antibacterial activities. Addition of CMC and PVP to the gel favored hexagonal phase formation. The gelation temperature was decreased linearly with an increasing concentration of drug(s), whereas, the melting temperature increased with the concentration of drug(s). Increasing the concentrations of each polymeric component significantly increased formulation hardness, compressibility, adhesiveness, mucoadhesion, and syringeability, yet a decreased cohesiveness. Increased time of contact between the formulation and mucin significantly increased the required force of detachment. Drug release from all formulations was non-diffusion controlled and significantly decreased as the concentration of the polymer was increased, due to the concomitant increased viscosity of the formulations and the swelling kinetics of PC, following contact with the dissolution fluid. RESULT: Antibacterial studies revealed that a gel with 30% HEC had a growth inhibition zone on agar with all three strains. CONCLUSION: Formulations containing HEC exhibited superior physical characteristics for improved drug delivery to the periodontal pocket and are now the subject of long-term clinical investigations.
TI  - Nuclear factor-kappaB p50 subunits in chronic periodontitis and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-pulsed dendritic cells.
AB  - The pathogenesis of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases has been linked to  dysregulated functioning of nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB. In the present study, we examine NF-kappaB activation in human oral mucosal tissues of chronic periodontitis (CP) patients. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNA-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicate elevated levels of transcriptionally repressive p50 subunits and an increased p50/p65 ratio in CP tissues compared to healthy controls. Because Porphyromonas gingivalis has been recognized to be a causal factor in CP, we used P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for in vitro studies with monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS, unlike Escherichia coli LPS, induced an increased p50/p65 ratio in MoDCs. Using blocking antibodies, we demonstrated that while both Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 are required for MoDC maturation by P. gingivalis LPS, only TLR4 signaling is sufficient to induce cytokine secretion. Our results suggest that increased levels of transcriptionally repressive p50 may be characteristic of CP and might be a result of suboptimal NF-kappaB activation and dendritic cell maturation by P. gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in CP.
TI  - Genetic variants associated with neutrophil function in aggressive periodontitis  and healthy controls.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms that influence neutrophil function were proposed as possible risk factors for aggressive periodontitis (AgP). The aim of this study is to test whether a clinical diagnosis and specific genetic variants are associated with neutrophil activity in subjects with AgP and healthy subjects. METHODS: This study describes the results of neutrophil analyses performed in 40 subjects (20 subjects with AgP and 20 healthy control subjects). Neutrophils were extracted from peripheral blood and analyzed in a masked manner for phagocytosis and oxidative burst by flow cytometry in response to Escherichia coli, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate p22 phagocytic oxidase subunit (p22(phox)) cytochrome b alpha gene (CYBA) C242T, crystallizable gamma fragment (Fcgamma)IIa H/R, and FcgammaIIIb neutrophil antigen (NA)1/NA2 polymorphisms. RESULTS: Analyses in pairs of white subjects (n = 24) revealed that patients with AgP exhibited a higher oxidative burst in response to E. coli (P = 0.002) and P. gingivalis (P = 0.002) compared to healthy control subjects. The p22(phox) CYBA 242 T allele was associated with an oxidative burst in response to the challenge by two strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans (P = 0.018 and P = 0.046). The FcgammaIIa polymorphism was associated with the phagocytic index of E. coli (P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous reports of a higher oxidative burst associated with AgP and presented preliminary evidence that genetic factors may influence neutrophil function in patients with AgP and healthy individuals.
TI  - Interleukin-1 and interleukin-8 in nicotine- and lipopolysaccharide-exposed gingival keratinocyte cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tobacco use is associated with increased periodontal destruction in both cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users. Gingival keratinocytes are the first cells in contact with microbial and tobacco components and play a key role in the innate immune response to these agents. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nicotine and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone and in combination on gingival keratinocyte production of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gingival keratinocyte cultures were established from 10 healthy, non-tobacco-using subjects. The cells were stimulated for 24 h with 1 mum or 1 mm nicotine and/or 10 microg/mL Escherichia coli or Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS. Interleukin-1 alpha and IL-8 proteins were quantified using ELISAs. RESULTS: Compared with untreated cultures, 1 mm nicotine stimulated production of IL-1 alpha (p < 0.001); E. coli and P. gingivalis LPS increased IL-8 production (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0232, respectively). A combination of nicotine and LPS produced the highest cytokine quantities. Amounts of IL-1 alpha and IL-8 following 1 mm nicotine and LPS exposure were significantly greater than in untreated cultures (p < 0.001). Interleukin-8 was also responsive to 0.1 mum nicotine combined with E. coli or P. gingivalis LPS compared with control cultures (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0029, respectively). Both cytokines tended to be elevated following the combined treatment relative to nicotine or LPS treatment alone. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that nicotine and LPS differentially regulate IL-1 and IL-8 production by gingival keratinocytes. Combined treatment tended to elevate cytokine production further, which may have implications for the progression of periodontitis in tobacco users.
TI  - [Sequence analysis of hemin-binding peptide derived from recombinant hemagglutinin-2 of Porphyromonas gingivalis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the sequence of the active peptide derived from recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA-2) of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). METHODS: The HA-2 gene from PgATCC33277 was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli (Ec) BL21 (DE3), and purified. The purified recombinant protein was evaluated for its ability to bind hemin-linked agarose. The active peptide was subjected to endoproteinase-mediated sequence analysis. RESULTS: The protein expressed in Ec BL21 (DE3) was identified as PgHA-2 by plasmid sequence analysis, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. The recombinant protein was confirmed functional by its ability to bind hemin. The sequence of the active peptide of rHA-2 was determined to be DHYAVMISKTGTNAG. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of sequence of the active peptide of rHA-2 provides a foundation for the development of immunoprophylactic and therapeutic agents against this human pathogen.
TI  - [Cloning of the fimA gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis and its expression and purification in Escherichia coli].
AB  - OBJECTIVE; To clone the fimA gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and detect its expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli). METHODS: The fimA gene was obtained by PCR from the genome of P. gingivalis to construct a prokaryotic expression plasmid pT-BAD/fimA. pT-BAD/fimA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells and the recombination protein was characterized by means of matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis. The bound protein was eluted with different concentrations of imidazole (250, 200, 150, 100, 50 micromol x L(-1)) respectively. RESULTS: DNA sequencing showed that the fragment was 99.9% consistent with that of the published. After induction with L-arabinose, a new 3.8 x 10(4) protein appeared on SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was further identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Purity of 95% of the target protein was purified by Ni-NTA Purification System after eluted with 100 micromol x L(-1) imidazole. CONCLUSION: The fimA gene of P. gingivalis was cloned successfully and its protein was expressed correctly in E. coli. A high purity of protein FimA was obtained and it could be applied for follow-up researches.
TI  - Expression and regulation of interleukin-33 in human monocytes.
AB  - Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1 family cytokine that has a role in regulating T helper type 2 cytokines and mast cell development. Expression of IL-33 is also associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, there is little information regarding IL-33 in myeloid cell immune responses, which are important in immunity and inflammation. We therefore investigated the expression, intracellular location and regulation of myeloid cell IL-33 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli and the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. We detected IL-33 messenger RNA in the human promonocytic cell line THP-1, in monocytes derived from these cells and in primary human monocytes. However, IL-33 was not expressed in primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Stimulation of monocytes with E. coli LPS (Toll-like receptor 4 agonist) and LPS from P. gingivalis (Toll-like receptor 2 agonist) up-regulated IL-33 at both the messenger RNA and protein levels but IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha had no effect. The IL-33 protein was mainly found in the cytoplasm of monocytes with no evidence of nuclear translocation in stimulated cells. Furthermore, no IL-33 secretion was detected after stimulation with LPS and/or ATP. These data indicate that the function, if any, of IL-33 in activated monocytes is primarily intracellular. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that IL-33 was sequestered in the nucleus of monocytes undergoing apoptosis but released into the extracellular milieu by LPS-stimulated cells in which necrosis had been induced by freeze-thawing. Therefore, this endorses the view that IL-33 may function as an 'alarmin' and have a role in signalling cellular damage and inflammatory disease pathogenesis through release from damaged or necrotic cells.
TI  - Hyper-responsive phenotype in localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - The 'hyper-responsive' trait is an increased inflammatory response upon stimulation of innate immune receptors. Our objective was to determine if a hyper-reactive trait is present in a cohort diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (LAgP). Peripheral blood was collected from 30 LAgP, 10 healthy unrelated, and 10 healthy sibling participants and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli and P. gingivalis. Cyto/chemokine response profiles were evaluated and analyzed by ANOVA. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cyto/chemokines were detected in E. coli and P. gingivalis LPS-stimulated LAgP cultures when compared with those of healthy unrelated control individuals. Periodontally healthy siblings presented with attenuated hyper-inflammatory cyto/chemokine profiles. Regression analysis demonstrated the hyper-reactive trait to be concomitant expression of pro-inflammatory cyto/chemokines and an absence of anti-inflammatory mediator expression. Our findings demonstrate hyper-responsive trait in a LAgP cohort, along with an attenuated hyper-responsiveness in healthy siblings, which can be induced in response to multiple TLR ligations.
TI  - MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance induced in human dendritic cells by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) cleaves collagen, allowing leukocytes to traffic toward the vasculature and the lymphatics. When MMP-9 is unregulated by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), this can lead to tissue destruction. Dendritic cells (DCs) infiltrate the oral mucosa increasingly in chronic periodontitis, characterized by infection with several pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis. In this study, human monocyte-derived DCs were pulsed with different doses of lipopolysaccharide of P. gingivalis 381 and of Escherichia coli type strain 25922, as well as whole live isogenic fimbriae-deficient mutant strains of P. gingivalis 381. Levels of induction of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, as well as interleukin-10 (IL-10), which reportedly inhibits MMP-9 induction, were measured by several approaches. Our results reveal that lipopolysaccharide of P. gingivalis, compared with lipopolysaccharide from E. coli type strain 25922, is a relatively potent inducer of MMP-9, but a weak inducer of TIMP-1, contributing to a high MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio.Whole live P. gingivalis strain 381, major fimbriae mutant DPG-3 and double mutant MFB were potent inducers of MMP-9, but minor fimbriae mutant MFI was not. MMP-9 induction was inversely proportional to IL-10 induction. These results suggest that lipopolysaccharide and the minor and the major fimbriae of P. gingivalis may play distinct roles in induction by DCs of MMP-9, a potent mediator of local tissue destruction and leukocyte trafficking.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies produced against lipopolysaccharide from fimA Type II Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - An important periodontal pathogen, Porphyromans gingivalis strains are classified into six genotypes (types I-V and Ib), based on the genotype of the fimbriae A (fimA). Among the genotypes, fimA type II strains are thought to be most strongly related to advanced periodontitis. To develop passive immunotherapy, over 300 hybridoma clones were constructed through immunization of cell extracts of fimA type II strain P. gingivalis TDC60 using hybridoma technology. Among these clones, 15 MAbs recognized TDC60 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with an individual ladder-like structure by Western blot analysis. Further Western blotting of the 15 MAbs against LPS from TDC60, FDC381 (fimA type I), and W83 (fimA type IV) of P. gingivalis and Escherichia coli was carried out. None of these MAbs recognized E. coli LPS, and divided into at least three different Western blot patterns. To confirm the specificity to LPS, three clones were selected and competition assays were carried out using TDC60 LPS. All three MAbs reduced the reactivity against TDC60 LPS after absorption of the LPS in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that MAbs recognizing different epitopes of P. gingivalis LPS were successfully constructed, and these MAbs may be useful in neutralizing P. gingivalis infection.
TI  - Neutralization of toxic haem by Porphyromonas gingivalis haemoglobin receptor.
AB  - Free haem is known to be toxic to organs, tissues and cells. It enhances permeability by binding to a cell membrane, which leads to cell death, and damages lipids, proteins and DNA through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Lysine- and arginine-specific gingipains (Kgp and RgpA/B) are major proteinases that play an important role in the pathogenicity of a black-pigmented periodontopathogen named Porphyromonas gingivalis. One of the adhesin domains of gingipain, HbR could bind haem as an iron nutrient source for P. gingivalis. Using erythrocyte and its membrane as a model, results from the present study demonstrate that recombinant HbR expressed in Escherichia coli could inhibit haem-induced haemolysis, probably through removing haem from the haem-membrane complex and lowering free haem toxicity by mediating dimerization of haem molecules. The ability to protect a cell membrane from haem toxicity is a new function for HbR.
TI  - Saliva enables the antimicrobial activity of LL-37 in the presence of proteases of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Proteolysis is a common microbial virulence mechanism that enables the destruction of host tissue and evasion from host defense mechanisms. Antimicrobial peptides, also known as host defense peptides, are effector molecules of the innate immunity that demonstrate a broad range of antimicrobial and immunoregulatory activities. Deficiency of the human LL-37 antimicrobial peptide was previously correlated with severe periodontal disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis, the major pathogen associated with periodontitis, is highly proteolytic. In this study, P. gingivalis was found capable of degrading LL-37 by utilizing its arginine-specific gingipains. Saliva collected from volunteers with a healthy periodontium protected LL-37 from proteolysis by P. gingivalis. Salivary protection of LL-37 was heat resistant and specific and enabled LL-37 to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli in the presence of the P. gingivalis proteases. Previously, saliva and other body fluids have been shown to inhibit the antimicrobial activity of LL-37. Here we demonstrate that at a cost of a small reduction in the bactericidal activity of LL-37, saliva enables the antibacterial activity of LL-37 despite the presence of proteases secreted by the main periodontopathogen.
TI  - Adaptation of Porphyromonas gingivalis to microaerophilic conditions involves increased consumption of formate and reduced utilization of lactate.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, previously classified as a strict anaerobe, can grow in the presence of low concentrations of oxygen. Microarray analysis revealed alteration in gene expression in the presence of 6 % oxygen. During the exponential growth phase, 96 genes were upregulated and 79 genes were downregulated 1.4-fold. Genes encoding proteins that play a role in oxidative stress protection were upregulated, including alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpCF), superoxide dismutase (sod) and thiol peroxidase (tpx). Significant changes in gene expression of proteins that mediate oxidative metabolism, such as cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase-encoding genes, cydA and cydB, were detected. The expression of genes encoding formate uptake transporter (PG0209) and formate tetrahydrofolate ligase (fhs) was drastically elevated, which indicates that formate metabolism plays a major role under aerobic conditions. The concomitant reduction of expression of a gene encoding the lactate transporter PG1340 suggests decreased utilization of this nutrient. The concentrations of both formate and lactate were assessed in culture supernatants and cells, and they were in agreement with the results obtained at the transcriptional level. Also, genes encoding gingipain protease secretion/maturation regulator (porR) and protease transporter (porT) had reduced expression in the presence of oxygen, which also correlated with reduced protease activities under aerobic conditions. In addition, metal transport was affected, and while iron-uptake genes such as the genes encoding the haemin uptake locus (hmu) were downregulated, expression of manganese transporter genes, such as feoB2, was elevated in the presence of oxygen. Finally, genes encoding putative regulatory proteins such as extracellular function (ECF) sigma factors as well as small proteins had elevated expression levels in the presence of oxygen. As P. gingivalis is distantly related to the well-studied model organism Escherichia coli, results from our work may provide further understanding of oxygen metabolism and protection in other related bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of galectin-3 on the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans endotoxin in splenocytes derived from mice.
AB  - Galectins, a family of animal lectins, are involved not only in development and differentiation but also in immunoregulation and host-pathogen interactions. Galectin-3 interacts with lipopolysaccharides in gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella minnesota and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The present study investigated whether galectin-3 inhibited the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides using splenocytes derived from mice of different ages. Lipopolysaccharides were extracted from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, and then purified. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis revealed that galectin-3 adhered to A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides, but not to the lipopolysaccharides of P. gingivalis. Splenocytes were prepared from 1- or 7-month-old C57BL/6 mice. Either A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides (200 ng mL(-1)) alone or lipopolysaccharides and murine galectin-3 (10 microg mL(-1)) were added to culture solutions, and the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) from splenocytes was measured by ELISA after a 17-h incubation. In all mice tested, A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide stimulation significantly increased the production of IL-6 and IFNgamma (P<0.01). Murine galectin-3 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production in the splenocytes of the 1-month-old mice (P<0.02 for IL-6; P<0.05 for IFNgamma), but not in the splenocytes of the 7-month-old mice. This suggests that responses change with age.
TI  - Human gingival fibroblasts release high-mobility group box-1 protein through active and passive pathways.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The nuclear protein high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) acts as a late mediator of inflammation when secreted in the extracellular milieu. In this study, we examined the effect of lipopolysaccharides from periodontal pathogens and apoptotic and necrotic cell death on HMGB1 production in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). METHODS: HGF from healthy periodontal tissue were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Escherichia coli. We also initiated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in HGF. The HMGB1 released in the supernatants from stimulated or dying cells was measured. Immunocytochemical staining against HMGB1 was performed in LPS-stimulated HGF. RESULTS: A significantly higher amount of HMGB1 was detected from necrotic and apoptotic HGF. LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and E. coli significantly induced the production of HMGB1 in a time-dependent manner. After 6 h of LPS stimulation, HMGB1 was present in the cytoplasm of cells whereas its location was mainly nuclear after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: LPS from two major periodontal pathogens, A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, induced HMGB1 secretion from HGF. Apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths resulted in the enhancement of HMGB1. Our results suggest that HGF can be a source of HMGB1 by both active secretion and passive release, and that HMGB1 from HGF may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction.
TI  - Expression of peptidylarginine deiminase from Porphyromonas gingivalis in Escherichia coli: enzyme purification and characterization.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes the deimination of peptidylarginine residues of various peptides to produce peptidylcitrulline and ammonia. P. gingivalis is associated with adult-onset periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, and its proliferation depends on secretion of PAD. We have expressed two recombinant forms of the P. gingivalis PAD in Escherichia coli, a truncated form with a 43-amino acid N-terminal deletion and the full-length form of PAD as predicted from the DNA sequence. Both forms contain a poly-His tag and Xpress epitope at the N-terminus to aid in detection and purification. The activities and stabilities of these two forms have been evaluated. PAD is cold sensitive; it aggregates within 30 min at 4 degrees C, and optimal storage conditions are at 25 degrees C in the presence of a reducing agent. PAD is not a metalloenzyme and does not need a cofactor for catalysis or stability. Multiple l-arginine analogs, various arginine-containing peptides, and free l-arginine were used to evaluate substrate specificity and determine kinetic parameters.
TI  - The gene coding for nigrescin produced by Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 25261.
AB  - AIM: To identify the gene that encodes nigrescin, a bacteriocin produced by Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 25261. METHODS AND RESULTS: Each open reading frame (ORF) of the nig gene cluster (nigA, nigB, nigC and nigD) was transferred into an expression vector. The recombinant proteins encoded by nigA, nigB, nigC and nigD were purified and assayed for bacteriocin activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis. The ORFs of the nig gene cluster in Pr. nigrescens ATCC 25261 were re-analysed. It revealed that the position of nig ORFs was similar to previously designated locations, except that the start codon of nigC was reassigned. The new nigC gene started at the nucleotide base position 2454 and stopped at position 3608 (the position designated is relative to the first nucleotide base of the nig locus) and putatively encoded a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 41.9 kDa. The N-terminal 6xHistidine-tag recombinant proteins of NigA, NigB, NigC and NigD were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 star (DE3) and were purified using Ni-NTA resins. Only recombinant NigC showed inhibitory activity against P. gingivalis A244 with minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 40 microg ml(-1). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that nigC is the gene that encodes nigrescin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report that indicates that the gene nigC codes for nigrescin, a bacteriocin produced by Pr. nigrescens ATCC 25261.
TI  - Human gingival fibroblasts are critical in sustaining inflammation in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A major factor in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, which is one of the biofilm infectious diseases, is thought to be lipopolysaccharide (LPS), owing to its ability to cause inflammation and promote tissue destruction. Moreover, the elimination of pathogens and their component LPSs is essential for the successful treatment of periodontal disease. Lipopolysaccharide tolerance is a mechanism that prevents excessive and prolonged responses of monocytes and macrophages to LPS. Since persistence of inflammation is necessary for inflammatory cytokine production, cells other than monocytes and macrophages are thought to maintain the production of cytokines in the presence of LPS. In this study, we investigated whether human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), the most abundant structural cell in periodontal tissue, might be able to maintain inflammatory cytokine production in the presence of LPS bynot displaying LPS tolerance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human gingival fibroblasts were pretreated with LPS (from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli) and then treated with LPS, and the amounts of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in the cell culture supernatants were measured. The expression of negative regulators of LPS signalling (suppressor of cytokine signalling-1, interleukin-1 receptor-associated-kinase M and SH2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1) was also examined in LPS-treated HGFs. RESULTS: Human gingival fibroblasts did not display LPS tolerance but maintained production of IL-6 and IL-8 when pretreated with LPS, followed by secondary LPS treatment. Lipopolysaccharide-treated HGFs did not express negative regulators. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that HGFs do not show LPS tolerance and suggest that this characteristic of HGFs sustains the inflammatory response in the presence of virulence factors.
TI  - Differential expression of immunoregulatory genes in monocytes in response to Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (strain W50) interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) leading to cytokine expression and inflammation, and thereby plays a key role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The aims of this study were to investigate gene expression of key regulatory mediators of innate immune responses in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) to P. gingivalis LPS and to compare these results with those obtained using the TLR-4 ligand, Escherichia coli LPS. Custom-made Taqman low-density arrays were used for expression profiling of 45 different cytokine-related genes. Both types of LPS highly up-regulated interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-1beta, IL-18 receptor (IL-18R), IL-18R accessory protein and IL-1 family (IL-1F)9. Expression levels of IL-1F6, IL-1F7 and caspase-1 were unaltered by either LPS. Genes for tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, leukaemia inhibitory factor and IL-32 were also highly induced by both LPS. For a subset of genes, including CXC chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), expression was induced only by E. coli LPS or was up-regulated more highly by E. coli compared with P. gingivalis LPS in THP-1 monocytes. A similar expression pattern was also observed in dendritic cells. Analysis of signalling pathways which lead to CXCL5 expression indicated that the mechanisms underpinning the differential responses did not involve the recruitment of different adaptor proteins by TLR-2 and TLR-4, and therefore occur downstream of the receptor-adaptor complex. We conclude that differences in signalling pathways activated by TLR-2 and TLR-4 ligands lead to differential innate immune responses which may be important in polymicrobial diseases such as periodontal disease.
TI  - Role of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione catabolism.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our previous studies demonstrated that three enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), cysteinylglycinase (CGase) and cystalysin, are required for the catabolism of glutathione to produce hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in Treponema denticola. In this study, we examined glutathione catabolism in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. METHODS: The GGT and CGase of A. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by biological methods and GGT was characterized using a molecular biological approach. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans showed GGT and CGase activity, but could not produce H(2)S from glutathione. The addition of recombinant T. denticola cystalysin, an l-cysteine desulfhydrase, to whole cells of A. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in the production of H(2)S from glutathione. Subsequently, we cloned A. actinomycetemcomitans GGT gene (ggt) and overexpressed the 63 kDa GGT protein. The recombinant A. actinomycetemcomitans GGT was purified and identified. The K(cat)/K(m) of the recombinant GGT from N-gamma-l-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline as substrate was 31/microm/min. The activity of GGT was optimum at pH 6.9-7.1 and enhanced by thiol-containing compounds. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that A. actinomycetemcomitans had GGT and CGase activities and that the GGT was characterized. The possible role of A. actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione metabolism and H(2)S production from oral bacteria was discussed.
TI  - Augmentation of the antimicrobial activities of guinea pig cathelicidin CAP11-derived peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  - Mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such  as defensin and cathelicidin) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading microorganisms. Among these, guinea pig cathelicidin CAP11 (G1-I43) possesses potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and also lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing activity. We previously revealed that the active region with antibacterial activity is localized at G1 to R18 of CAP11. In this study, to develop peptide derivatives with enhanced antimicrobial actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (G1-R18) as a template. Anti-microbial activities of the peptides were assessed by alamarBlue assay (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) and colony formation assay (Porphyromonas gingivalis). Furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities were determined by using E. coli ML-35p as a target. By substituting K5, T9, R10, R12, and G17 with five L residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (1-18m1) was increased, and by substituting G1, and Q14 with K and R residues, respectively, the hydrophilicity (positive charge) of the peptide (1-18m2) was enhanced. Among the peptides, 1-18m2 exhibits the most potent antimicrobial and membrane-permeabilizing activities against the microorganisms examined. Thus, the antimicrobial activities of the amphipathic CAP11-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity (positive charge), and 1-18m2 is the most potent among the peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for Gram-positive and -negative bacterial, and fungal infections.
TI  - Identification and molecular characterization of tryptophanase encoded by tnaA in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Indole produced via the beta-elimination reaction of l-tryptophan by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) has recently been shown to be an extracellular and intercellular signalling molecule in bacteria, and controls bacterial biofilm formation and virulence factors. In the present study, we determined the molecular basis of indole production in the periodontopathogenic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis. A database search showed that the amino acid sequence deduced from pg1401 of P. gingivalis W83 is 45 % identical with that from tnaA of Escherichia coli K-12, which encodes tryptophanase. Replacement of the pg1401 gene in the chromosomal DNA with the chloramphenicol-resistance gene abolished indole production. The production of indole was restored by the introduction of pg1401, demonstrating that the gene is functionally equivalent to tnaA. However, RT-PCR and RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses showed that, unlike E. coli tnaA, pg1401 is expressed alone in P. gingivalis and that the nucleotide sequence of the transcription start site is different, suggesting that the expression of P. gingivalis tnaA is controlled by a unique mechanism. Purified recombinant P. gingivalis tryptophanase exhibited the Michaelis-Menten kinetics values K(m)=0.20+/-0.01 mM and k(cat)=1.37+/-0.06 s(-1) in potassium phosphate buffer, but in sodium phosphate buffer, the enzyme showed lower activity. However, the cation in the buffer, K(+) or Na(+), did not appear to affect the quaternary structure of the enzyme or the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to the enzyme. The enzyme also degraded S-ethyl-l-cysteine and S-methyl-l-cysteine, but not l-alanine, l-serine or l-cysteine.
TI  - Critical role of apoptotic speck protein containing a caspase recruitment domain  (ASC) and NLRP3 in causing necrosis and ASC speck formation induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis in human cells.
AB  - Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that leads to the destruction of tooth-supporting tissue and affects 10-20 million people in the U.S. alone. The oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis causes inflammatory host response leading to periodontal and other secondary inflammatory diseases. To identify molecular components that control host response to P. gingivalis in humans, roles for the NLR (NBD-LRR) protein, NLRP3 (cryopyrin, NALP3), and its adaptor apoptotic speck protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC) were studied. P. gingivalis strain A7436 induces cell death in THP1 monocytic cells and in human primary peripheral blood macrophages. This process is ASC and NLRP3 dependent and can be replicated by P. gingivalis LPS and Escherichia coli. P. gingivalis-induced cell death is caspase and IL-1 independent and exhibits morphological features consistent with necrosis including loss of membrane integrity and release of cellular content. Intriguingly, P. gingivalis-induced cell death is accompanied by the formation of ASC aggregation specks, a process not previously described during microbial infection. ASC specks are observed in P. gingivalis-infected primary human mononuclear cells and are dependent on NLRP3. This work shows that P. gingivalis causes ASC- and NLRP3-dependent necrosis, accompanied by ASC speck formation.
TI  - B cells from periodontal disease patients express surface Toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Chronic systemic inflammation links periodontal disease (PD) to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Activation of TLRs, particularly TLR4, promotes chronic inflammation in PD by stimulating myeloid cells. B cells from healthy individuals are generally refractory to TLR4 agonists as a result of low surface TLR4 expression. Unexpectedly, a significantly increased percentage of gingival and peripheral blood B cells from patients with PD expressed surface TLR4. Surface expression correlated with an active TLR4 promoter that mimicked the TLR4 promoter in neutrophils. B cells from PD patients were surface myeloid differentiation protein 2-positive and also packaged the enhancer of a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1 beta, into an active structure, demonstrating that these cells harbor key characteristics of proinflammatory cell types. Furthermore, B cells lacked activating signatures of a natural IL-1 beta inhibitor, IL-1 receptor antagonist. Surprisingly, despite multiple signatures of proinflammatory cells, freshly isolated B cells from PD patients had decreased expression of TLR pathway genes compared with B cells from healthy individuals. Decreases in inflammatory gene expression were even more dramatic in B cells stimulated with a TLR4 ligand from a periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS 1690. In contrast, B cell TLR4 was not activated by the prototypic TLR4 ligand Escherichia coli LPS. These findings raise the unexpected possibility that TLR4 engagement modulates B cell activation in PD patients.
TI  - Up-regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-response in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is the cell response by activation  of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in a variety of conditions such as infection and aging. The UPR may be associated with the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because of the induction of apoptosis and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a transcription factor for pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the relationship between ER stress and periodontal disease is yet to be determined. METHODS: The expression of UPR-related molecules was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively and compared between gingivitis and periodontitis. The gene expressions were also analyzed for macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) or IFN-gamma. RESULTS: The expression levels of UPR-related genes and HSP60 were significantly higher in periodontitis compared with gingivitis lesions. However, LPS from P. gingivalis but not E. coli or IFN-gamma failed to up-regulate the gene expression in macrophage. CONCLUSIONS: An inflammatory response may have profound effect on the UPR response, particularly in periodontitis patients. Considering the histological nature of periodontitis and the link between UPR and inflammatory responses via NF-kappaB, ER stress in B cells could be another pathological mechanism underlying periodontal disease.
TI  - [Effect of lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis on prostaglandin E2 biosynthetic pathway in human monocytic cell strain THP-1].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg-LPS) on the bio-thythetic pathway of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its difference from lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli (Ec-LPS). METHODS: Purified Pg-LPS and Ec-LPS were used to stimulate a human monocytic cell strain THP-1. PGE2 concentration was determined by an enzyme immunoassay kit. The release of tritium labeled arachidonic acid (AA) was detected by a liquid scintillation counter. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to analyse the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). RESULTS: The effect of Pg-LPS on induction of PGE2 and release of AA was significantly weaker than that of Ec-LPS (P < 0.05).Increased secretion of PGE2 was observed after stimulation with Pg-LPS for 6 h, which peak at 24 h at (221.40 +/- 29.46) ng/L; or with Ec-LPS for 1-48 h, at (161.80 +/- 17.31) approximately (379.80 +/- 37.35) ng/L. The highest levels of COX-2 and mPGES-1 were shown after 16 h treatment by Pg-LPS, or after 8 h and 16 h by Ec-LPS respectively.cPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 could lower the level of LPS-induced release of AA, while it did not influence the production of PGE2. COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 could remarkably reduce the concentration of PGE2. CONCLUSIONS: Pg-LPS showed delayed and weaker effect on PGE2 biosynthetic pathway than Ec-LPS. Pg-LPS-induced PGE2 synthesis was mainly due to enhanced expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1, whereas cPLA2 played an insignificant role.
TI  - Participation of the secreted dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases in asaccharolytic growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Porphyromonas gingivalis secretes gingipains, endopeptidases essential for the asaccharolytic growth of this bacterium. P. gingivalis also secretes dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPPIV and DPP-7) and a tripeptidyl aminopeptidase (PTP-A), although their role in asaccharolytic growth is unclear. The present study was carried out to elucidate the role of these dipeptidyl/tripeptidyl aminopeptidases on the asaccharolytic growth of P. gingivalis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Knockout mutants for the DPPIV (dpp), dpp7 and/or PTP-A genes were constructed. Brain-heart infusion medium supplemented with sterile hemin and menadione (BHIHM) was used as a complex medium, and the minimal medium used was GA, in which the sole energy source was a mixture of immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin. Growth of P. gingivalis was monitored by measuring the optical density of the culture. RESULTS: All knockout mutants for DPPIV, dpp7 and PTP-A grew as well as strain W83 in BHIHM. In GA, growth of single-knockout and double-knockout mutants was similar to that of W83, whereas growth of a triple-knockout mutant (83-47A) was reduced. We purified recombinant DPPIV and recombinant PTP-A from recombinant Escherichia coli overproducers, and purified DPP-7 from the triple-knockout mutant 83-4A. GA supplemented with the three purified dipeptidyl/tripeptidyl aminopeptidases supported the growth of 83-47A. CONCLUSION: DPPIV, DPP-7 and PTP-A contribute to the normal growth of P. gingivalis by cleaving substrate peptides into short-chain polypeptides that are efficient energy sources for P. gingivalis.
TI  - Surface components of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Research on Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathogen, has provided a tremendous amount of information over the last 20 years, which may exceed in part than that on other closely related members in terms of phylogenetic as well as proteomic criteria, including Bacteroides fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron as major anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens in the medical field. In this minireview, we focused on recent research findings concerning surface components such as outer membrane proteins and fimbriae, of P. gingivalis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Elucidation of the surface components in P. gingivalis was especially difficult because outer membrane proteins are tightly bound to lipopolysaccharide and they are resistant to dissociation and separation from each other, even during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, unless samples are appropriately heated. In addition, P. gingivalis is asaccharolytic and therefore a potent proteolytic bacterium, another factor causing difficulty in research. The study of the surface components was carefully carried out considering these unique features in P. gingivalis when compared with other gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Separation of outer membrane proteins, and characterization of OmpA-like proteins and RagAB as major proteins, is described herein. Our recent findings on FimA and Mfa1 fimbriae, two unique appendages in this organism, and on their regulation of expression are also described briefly. CONCLUSION: Surface components of P. gingivalis somehow have contact with host tissues and cells because of the outermost cell elements. Therefore, such bacterial components are potentially important in the occurrence of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae induce unique dendritic cell subsets via Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in the activation of T cells as well as in shaping immune responses. We have reported previously that Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (Pg LPS) induced a CD14(+)CD16(+) DC subset with a weak immuno-stimulatory activity. In contrast, Escherichia coli LPS (Ec LPS) induced fully matured DCs with strong immunostimulatory activities. Since Pg LPS as well as Pg fimbriae have been indicated to work as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligands, we speculate that the TLR usage of bacterial antigens may be critical for DC maturation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of Pg fimbriae on the phenotype and function of human peripheral blood DCs in comparison with a TLR2 ligand, peptidoglycan, and a TLR4 ligand, Ec LPS. RESULTS: Flow cytometry revealed that Pg fimbriae and peptidoglycan but not Ec LPS induced CD14 and CD16 expression on peripheral blood DCs (CD14(-)CD16(-)). A monoclonal antibody against TLR2 abrogated this induction, but an antibody against TLR4 had no effect. Dendritic cells stimulated with Pg fimbriae had a weaker capability to induce allogenic T cell proliferation and exhibited a weaker production of interleukin-8 and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) than DCs stimulated with Ec LPS. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that different TLR usage affects mature DC phenotype and function and is thus crucial to the regulation of immunity to the pathogen.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 secretion, and CCL25 gene expression, in mouse primary gingival cell lines: interleukin-6-driven activation of CCL2.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Porphyromonas gingivalis infection is strongly associated with periodontitis. Although P. gingivalis is known to elicit a strong inflammatory response, details of that remain fragmentary. To understand the local response to P. gingivalis, primary cell lines derived from mouse gingival tissues were exposed to P. gingivalis or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and the production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured. CCL25 gene expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cells stimulated with combinations of interleukin-6, soluble interleukin-6 receptor and/or soluble gp130 were assayed for CCL2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Primary cell lines were generated from mouse gingival tissues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine cytokine levels, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify CCL25 gene expression. RESULTS: Exposure to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide but not to E. coli lipopolysaccharide resulted in significantly elevated levels of both interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and stimulation with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide also upregulated CCL25 gene expression. In one of three experiments, interleukin-6 induced CCL2 secretion, whereas interleukin-6 plus soluble interleukin-6 receptor induced CCL2 secretion in all three experiments, suggesting that both direct interleukin-6 signaling and interleukin-6 trans-signaling may be involved. However, because soluble gp130 did not inhibit trans-signaling, and because direct stimulation of gingival cells with soluble gp130 resulted in CCL2 secretion, the possibility exists that soluble gp130 forms binary complexes with soluble interleukin-6 receptor that promote direct interleukin-6 stimulation. CONCLUSION: These findings define a pathway in which exposure of gingival cells to P. gingivalis induces the release of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; interleukin-6, in turn, induces CCL2 secretion.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, gamma interferon, and a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix form a synergistic trio that induces c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1-mediated nitric oxide generation and cell death.
AB  - During infection and inflammation, bacterial and inflammatory proteases break down extracellular matrices into macromolecular fragments. Fibronectin fragments are associated with disease severity in arthritis and periodontitis. The mechanisms by which these fragments contribute to disease pathogenesis are unclear. One likely mechanism is that fibronectin fragments induce apoptosis of resident cells, which can be further modulated by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide levels are increased at inflammatory sites in periodontitis patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix (AFn) exerts its action by inducing nitric oxide and whether priming by bacterial and inflammatory components exacerbates this mechanism. Our data demonstrate that AFn increased the levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) dose and time dependently in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. These effects and apoptosis were inhibited by iNOS suppression and enhanced by iNOS overexpression. Nitric oxide and iNOS induction were paralleled by increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) phosphorylation. JNK-1 overexpression enhanced the expression of nitric oxide and iNOS, whereas inhibiting JNK-1 by small interfering RNA or a kinase mutant reversed these findings. Priming PDL cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis, its lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) further increased nitric oxide levels and apoptosis. Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans induced lesser effects. Gingival fibroblasts and neutrophils responded to a lesser degree to these stimuli, whereas keratinocytes were resistant to apoptosis. Thus, proapoptotic matrices trigger nitric oxide release via JNK-1, promoting further apoptosis in host cells. LPS and IFN-gamma accentuate this mechanism, suggesting that during inflammation, the affected matrices and bacterial and inflammatory components combined exert a greater pathogenic effect on host cells.
TI  - The role of the RgpA-Kgp proteinase-adhesin complexes in the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to fibroblasts.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis strains W50 and ATCC 33277 were shown to bind to cultured human fibroblast (MRC-5) cells using flow cytometry. As the concentration of P. gingivalis strain W50 cells was increased relative to the concentration of MRC-5 cells, the number of W50 cells bound per MRC-5 cell increased, as did the percentage of MRC-5 cells with bacteria bound. However, this relationship was only seen for P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277 at low cell concentrations: at high bacterial cell concentrations strain ATCC 33277 auto-aggregated and binding to the MRC-5 cells decreased. Strain W50 was therefore chosen to study the role of the surface proteinase-adhesin complexes (RgpA-Kgp complexes) in binding to MRC-5 cells. P. gingivalis W50 cells treated with an inhibitor of the RgpA-Kgp complexes exhibited reduced binding to MRC-5 cells. The purified active and proteinase-inactive RgpA-Kgp complexes competitively inhibited binding of W50 to MRC-5 cells, and isogenic mutants of W50 lacking RgpA/B and Kgp displayed reduced binding. P. gingivalis W50 mutant cells lacking Kgp exhibited the lowest binding to MRC-5 cells, suggesting an important role for this proteinase and its associated adhesins in binding to fibroblasts.
TI  - Thymosin beta4 is cytoprotective in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - Thymosin beta4 (Tbeta(4)) is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous, non-toxic protein with documented wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and tissue-repair properties in skin, the ocular surface, and the heart. The ability of Tbeta(4) to demonstrate similar protective properties in cells of the oral cavity was analyzed using an in vitro model of cultured human gingival fibroblasts. Thymosin beta 4 significantly suppressed the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) following stimulation with tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-alpha), suggesting that it may suppress the inflammatory response initiated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, Tbeta(4) was not effective in protecting fibroblasts from challenge with lipopolysaccharide purified from Porphyromonas gingivalis or Escherichia coli. Thymosin beta 4 was able to protect gingival fibroblasts against the known cytotoxic effects of chlorhexidine digluconate, a mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine digluconate, and carbamide peroxide. Additionally, Tbeta(4) was able to protect gingival fibroblasts from the apoptosis that is induced by stimulation with TNF-alpha or by exposure to chlorhexidine. Because of its multifunctional roles in protecting cells against damage, Tbeta(4) may have significant potential for use as an oral heathcare aid with combined antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and cytoprotective properties.
TI  - Immunogenicity of a cholera toxin B subunit Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrial antigen fusion protein expressed in E. coli.
AB  - The gram-negative anaerobic oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis initiates periodontal disease through fimbrial attachment to saliva-coated oral surfaces. To study the effects of immunomodulation on enhancement of subunit vaccination, the expression in E. coli and immunogenicity of P. gingivalis fimbrial protein (FimA) linked to the C-terminus of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) were investigated. Complementary DNAs encoding the P. gingivalis 381 fimbrillin protein sequence FimA1 (amino acid residues 1-200) and FimA2 (amino acid residues 201-337) were cloned into an E. coli expression vector downstream of a cDNA fragment encoding the immunostimulatory CTB. CTB-FimA1 and CTB-FimA2 fusion proteins synthesized in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were purified under denaturing conditions by Ni2+-NTA affinity column chromatography. Renaturation of the CTB-FimA1 and CTB-FimA2 fusion proteins, permitted identification of CTB-FimA pentamers and restored CTB binding activity to GM1-ganglioside to provide a biologically active CTB-FimA fusion protein. Mice orally inoculated with purified CTB-FimA1 or CTB-FimA2 fusion proteins generated measurable FimA1 and FimA2 IgG antibody titers, while no serum fimbrial IgG antibodies were detected when mice were inoculated with FimA1 or FimA2 proteins alone. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that sera from mice immunized with CTB linked to FimA1 or FimA2 contained antibodies specific for P. gingivalis fimbrial proteins. In addition, mice immunized with FimA2 or CTB-FimA2 generated measurable intestinal IgA titers indicating the presence of fimbrial antibody class switching. Further, mice orally immunized with CTB-FimA1 generated higher IgA antibody titers than mice inoculated with FimA1 alone. The experimental data show that the immunostimulatory molecule CTB enhances B cell-mediated immunity against linked P. gingivalis FimA fusion proteins, in comparison to immunization with FimA protein alone. Thus, linkage of CTB to P. gingivalis fimbrial antigens can increase subunit vaccine immunogenicity to provide enhanced protection against periodontal disease.
TI  - Synthetic tetra-acylated derivatives of lipid A from Porphyromonas gingivalis are antagonists of human TLR4.
AB  - Tetra-acylated lipid As derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS have been synthesized using a key disaccharide intermediate functionalized with levulinate (Lev), allyloxycarbonate (Alloc) and anomeric dimethylthexylsilyl (TDS) as orthogonal protecting groups and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbamate (Fmoc) and azido as amino protecting groups. Furthermore, an efficient cross-metathesis has been employed for the preparation of the unusual branched R-(3)-hydroxy-13-methyltetradecanic acid and (R)-3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoic acid of P. gingivalis lipid A. Biological studies have shown that the synthetic lipid As cannot activate human and mouse TLR2 and TLR4 to produce cytokines. However, it has been found that the compounds are potent antagonist of cytokine secretion by human monocytic cells induced by enteric LPS.
TI  - [Characterization and antibacterial effect of Ag-nHA-nTiO2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (Ag-nHA-nTiO2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (PA66) by co-polymerization method. The purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. METHODS: The morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. RESULTS: XRD results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (HA). A homogeneous distribution of the Ca, P, Ti and Ag element in the membrane was confirmed by EDX. Both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by SEM and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. The bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of S. aureus and 56.31% of E. coli were killed. However, 91.84% of P. gingivalis, 90.64% of F. nucleatum and 90.49% of S. mutans were killed and pictures of SEM showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. CONCLUSION: The nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis induces IL-1beta, TNF-alpha  and IL-6 production by THP-1 cells in a way different from that of Escherichia coli LPS.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to differ from enterobacterial LPS in structure and function; therefore, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the intracellular inflammatory signaling pathways are accordingly different. To elucidate the signal transduction pathway of P. gingivalis, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 was measured by ELISA, and the TLRs were determined by the blocking test using anti-TLRs antibodies. In addition, specific inhibitors as well as Phospho-ELISA kits were used to analyze the intracellular signaling pathways. Escherichia coli LPS was used as the control. In this study, P. gingivalis LPS showed the ability to induce cytokine production in THP-1 cells and its induction was significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed by anti-TLR2 antibody or JNK inhibitor, and the phosphorylation level of JNK was significantly increased (P < 0.05). These results indicate that TLR2-JNK is the main signaling pathway of P. gingivalis LPS-induced cytokine production, while the cytokine induction by E. coli LPS was mainly via TLR4-NF-kappaB and TLR4-p38MAPK. This suggests that P. gingivalis LPS differs from E. coli LPS in its signaling pathway in THP-1 cells, and that the TLR2-JNK pathway might play a significant role in P. gingivalis LPS-induced chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.
TI  - Functional analysis of the thioredoxin domain in Porphyromonas gingivalis HBP35.
AB  - Periodontitis is one of the most common oral diseases in humans. This caused by infection by the oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis. Our strategy to prevent this infection is to establish a passive immunization system in which endogenous antibodies can be applied directly to neutralize virulent factors associated with this bacterium. We focused our attention on the P. gingivalis 35 kDa surface protein, or HBP35, since this protein is involved not only in the coaggregation with oral miroflora but also in hemin binding. In addition, nucleotide sequencing of the gene, hbp35, coding for this protein revealed the presence of a catalytic center for thioredoxin, and we further attempted to characterized the protein by amino acid substitution. A total of four Cys residues were substituted for Ser residues by combining the simple method for site-directed mutagenesis and the heterodimer system, an approach designed to construct chimeric plasmids readily. Native and mutagenized hbp35 were introduced into the Eschericha coli dsbA mutant strain, JCB 572, defective in both alkaline phosphatase and motile activities due to inefficient disulfide bond formation. Transformant harboring the native hbp35 could complement the dsbA mutation, suggesting a role of disulfide bond formation of this protein in P. gingivalis cells. Possible roles of the Cys residues in complementation are discussed.
TI  - P. gingivalis and E. coli lipopolysaccharides exhibit different systemic but similar local induction of inflammatory markers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative bacterium that is an important etiologic agent of human adult periodontitis. The goal of the study was to test the hypothesis that two isoforms of P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (PgLPS), PgLPS(1435)(/1449) and PgLPS(1690), exhibit differences in their capacity to stimulate systemic versus local responses compared to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: LPS was inoculated into the scalp of mice, and the response was measured locally at the site of inoculation and systemically in the heart/aorta. Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 was assessed at the protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and VCAM-1, E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 were assessed at the RNA level of the RNase protection assay. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were also measured. RESULTS: E. coli LPS and both isoforms of P. gingivalis LPS were relatively potent in stimulating the expression of inflammatory markers, with E. coli LPS being more potent. In contrast, when the systemic response was measured in the heart/aorta, E. coli LPS, but not P. gingivalis LPS, significantly induced inflammatory markers. At moderate to low doses (1 and 10 microg per injection), serum TNF-alpha levels were minimally induced by P. gingivalis LPS compared to E. coli LPS. CONCLUSIONS: Both forms of P. gingivalis LPS stimulated an inflammatory response when injected into connective tissue but were minimally stimulatory when a systemic response was measured. In contrast, E. coli LPS was a potent stimulus at the systemic and local levels.
TI  - Invasive differences among Porphyromonas gingivalis strains from healthy and diseased periodontal sites.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine any difference between Porphyromonas gingivalis isolates from periodontally healthy sites as compared to those from diseased sites with respect to the ability to invade host cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from periodontally healthy and diseased sites using paper points. P. gingivalis colonies were isolated and tested, using an antibiotic protection assay, for their ability to invade KB cells. P. gingivalis 381 and Escherichia coli MC1061 were used as controls. RESULTS: Mean values of 16.79 +/- 0.86 x 10(3) colony-forming units/mL and 26.14 +/- 2.11 x 10(3) colony-forming units/mL were observed in invasion assays for isolates from periodontally healthy and diseased sites, respectively. P. gingivalis present in diseased sites had significantly greater invasive abilities than strains isolated from healthy sites. No statistical difference was noted between male or female subjects concerning the degree of invasion; isolates from diseased sites from both genders had significantly greater invasion abilities than those from healthy sites. A significant correlation was found between the increased invasive capabilities of P. gingivalis isolates vs. an increased probing depth. CONCLUSION: The increased invasion noted with P. gingivalis isolates from diseased sites vs. healthy sites, and the increased invasive capabilities with increasing probing depth, indicate that P. gingivalis isolates have a varying ability to invade host cells in the periodontal pocket.
TI  - The anti-endotoxic effects of the KSL-W decapeptide on Escherichia coli O55:B5 and various oral lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Host responses following the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide can range from acute inflammation to septic shock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the KSL-W decapeptide to bind to and block the endotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay using fluorescently labeled KSL-W to detect adsorbed Escherichia coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide was employed. A commercially available recombinant Factor C lipopolysaccharide detection assay, hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes as well as E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the anti-endotoxic effects after KSL-W exposure to E. coli lipopolysaccharide as well as to oral lipopolysaccharide samples. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide-binding assays using E. coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide revealed both a higher maximal binding range (532-713 microM) and a half-maximum binding concentration (70-185 microM) for the KSL-W peptide when compared with its analog control. Significant inhibition of E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (p < 0.0001) as well as hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes occurred after the interaction of KSL-W with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. Recombinant Factor C enzyme detection inhibition revealed dose-dependent inhibition values ranging from 1.0-51.8 microM. which were dependent upon the type of lipopolysaccharide sample tested. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that for the concentrations tested, the KSL-W decapeptide was nontoxic to mammalian cells and could bind to and block the host recognition and response towards enteric, as well as oral, lipopolysaccharide samples.
TI  - Acyl chain specificity of the acyltransferases LpxA and LpxD and substrate availability contribute to lipid A fatty acid heterogeneity in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipid A is heterogeneous with regard to the number, type, and placement of fatty acids. Analysis of lipid A by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry reveals clusters of peaks differing by 14 mass units indicative of an altered distribution of the fatty acids generating different lipid A structures. To examine whether the transfer of hydroxy fatty acids with different chain lengths could account for the clustering of lipid A structures, P. gingivalis lpxA (lpxA(Pg)) and lpxD(Pg) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli strains in which the homologous gene was mutated. Lipid A from strains expressing either of the P. gingivalis transferases was found to contain 16-carbon hydroxy fatty acids in addition to the normal E. coli 14-carbon hydroxy fatty acids, demonstrating that these acyltransferases display a relaxed acyl chain length specificity. Both LpxA and LpxD, from either E. coli or P. gingivalis, were also able to incorporate odd-chain fatty acids into lipid A when grown in the presence of 1% propionic acid. This indicates that E. coli lipid A acyltransferases do not have an absolute specificity for 14-carbon hydroxy fatty acids but can transfer fatty acids differing by one carbon unit if the fatty acid substrates are available. We conclude that the relaxed specificity of the P. gingivalis lipid A acyltransferases and the substrate availability account for the lipid A structural clusters that differ by 14 mass units observed in P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide preparations.
TI  - Nasal vaccination with the 40-kilodalton outer membrane protein of Porphyromonas  gingivalis and a nontoxic chimeric enterotoxin adjuvant induces long-term protective immunity with reduced levels of immunoglobulin E antibodies.
AB  - In this study, we demonstrated that the 40-kDa outer membrane protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis (40-kDa OMP) nasally administered with a nontoxic chimeric adjuvant that combines the A subunit of mutant cholera toxin E112K with the pentameric B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (mCTA/LTB) elicited a long-term protective immune response. Immunization with the 40-kDa OMP and mCTA/LTB induced high levels of 40-kDa-OMP-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibodies (Abs) in sera and elicited a significant IgA anti-40-kDa OMP Ab response in saliva. These Ab responses were maintained for at least 1 year after the immunization. Although using adjuvant mCTA/LTB gave Ab responses in the saliva comparable to those obtained using native cholera toxin (nCT) as the adjuvant, the levels of total IgE and 40-kDa-OMP-specific IgE Abs as well as interleukin-4 levels induced by the immunization with mCTA/LTB were lower than those induced by the immunization with nCT. Importantly, IgG Abs generated by nasal immunization with the 40-kDa OMP plus mCTA/LTB inhibited the coaggregation and hemagglutinin activities of P. gingivalis. Furthermore, the mice given nasal 40-kDa OMP plus mCTA/LTB showed a significant reduction of alveolar bone loss caused by oral infection with P. gingivalis even 1 year after the immunization compared to the loss in unimmunized mice. Because mCTA/LTB is nontoxic, nasally administered 40-kDa OMP together with mCTA/LTB should be an effective and safe mucosal vaccine against P. gingivalis infection in humans and may be an important tool for the prevention of chronic periodontitis.
TI  - An acute injection of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide modulates the OPG/RANKL system and interleukin-6 in an ovariectomized mouse model.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the present study, we attempted to develop a simulated model  to explore the causal effects of periodontal pathogens on skeletal homeostasis in postmenopausal osteoporosis. METHODS: Fifty-three female adult ICR mice were randomly assigned to an experimental group (ovariectomized) or a control group. A single injection of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P. gingivalis-LPS, ATCC 33277) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (E. coli-LPS) was administered intraperitoneally 4 weeks after an ovariectomy. Concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) in serum were subsequently analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Under stimulation with P. gingivalis-LPS or E. coli-LPS, the concentration of OPG rose in both groups. The serum level of RANKL showed a decreasing trend 24 h after the injection in both groups. After injection of P. gingivalis-LPS in both the experimental and control animals, the OPG : RANKL ratio increased 24 h after the booster (22.26-620.99, P < 0.05). The serum level of IL-6 in the experimental group significantly increased 1-6 h after administration of E. coli-LPS and 1-3 h after administration of P. gingivalis-LPS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A single booster injection of P. gingivalis-LPS induced short-term changes in OPG, RANKL, and IL-6 serum levels in this ovariectomized mouse model.
TI  - Prevotella intermedia induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play pivotal roles in inflammatory diseases including chronic periodontitis. The effects of Prevotella intermedia, a major periodontal pathogen, on MMP-9 production in primary human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells were examined in the present study. MMP-9 mRNA expression was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and its protein secretion was assayed by gelatin zymography. Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 supernatant time and dose-dependently induced MMP-9 expression. In contrast, Porphyromanas gingivalis ATCC 33277 supernatants, Escherichia coli lipopolysacchride and IL-1beta exhibited no stimulatory effects on MMP-9 production in hPDL cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinases [MAPK, including extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38] inhibitors exerted no effect on the P. intermedia-induced MMP-9 production, indicating that P. intermedia induced MMP-9 production through an MAPK-independent pathway. Our results demonstrated that P. intermedia may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction during chronic periodontitis by inducing MMP-9 production in hPDL cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine by two different  tests.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%) with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin, BSA) against some bacterial samples (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) using two activity tests (contact and diffusion agar tests). In the contact test (first model), bacterial samples were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for different time intervals: immediately (t(0)), 5 min (t(5)), 15 min (t(15)) and 30 min (t(30)). The agar diffusion test was the second model used. In half the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added to simulate organic tissue present in the root canal. Bacterial growth was evaluated for each microorganism and activity test. Each test was repeated 10 times. In the contact test, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (CHX) did not eliminate E. faecalis at any tested time. CHX at 0.5% eliminated all strains except E. faecalis after immediate contact. All strains were eliminated by 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl. BSA did not interfere with the antimicrobial activity of the irrigating solutions. In the agar diffusion test, all solutions exhibited zones of antimicrobial activity; however, BSA interfered with the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl and CHX. Under the condition of the contact test, the 0.12% CHX was ineffective in eliminating E. faecalis, while 0.5% CHX, 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl showed antibacterial effectiveness against all the tested bacterial strains. The addition of an organic load interfered with the accuracy of the agar diffusion test.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate.
AB  - Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an antioxidant with a metal-chelating activity, has been used widely to inhibit the expression of inflammatory genes in vitro and in vivo. This study investigated whether PDTC has an antimicrobial activity against various bacteria. The antibacterial activity of PDTC and other compounds was evaluated in vitro by the broth microdilution method against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Bacterial growth was inhibited by PDTC, where a wide range of sensitivity was demonstrated among the tested bacteria. The antibacterial activity of PDTC was reduced by the addition of copper chloride; in contrast, it was enhanced considerably by zinc chloride. Two different zinc chelators, Ca-saturated EDTA (Ca-EDTA) and N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine, blocked the antibacterial activity of PDTC, whereas Zn-EDTA failed to reduce the activity of PDTC. These results demonstrate for the first time that PDTC possesses an antibacterial activity, for which zinc is required, and suggest that PDTC, possessing a dual anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity, may be considered for topical use for inflammatory diseases of bacterial origin.
TI  - Biological properties of the native and synthetic lipid A of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND METHODS: A pentaacyl and diphosphoryl lipid A molecule found in  the lipid A isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was chemically synthesized, and its characteristics were evaluated to reconfirm its interesting bioactivities including low endotoxicity and activity against LPS-unresponsive C3H/HeJ mouse cells. RESULTS: The synthesized P. gingivalis lipid A (synthetic Pg-LA) exhibited strong activities almost equivalent to those of Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A (compound 506) in all assays on LPS-responsive mice, and cells. LPS and native lipid A of P. gingivalis displayed overall endotoxic activities, but its potency was reduced in comparison to the synthetic analogs. In the assays using C3H/HeJ mouse cells, the LPS and native lipid A significantly stimulated splenocytes to cause mitosis, and peritoneal macrophages to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 production. However, synthetic Pg-LA and compound 506 showed no activity on the LPS-unresponsive cells. Inhibition assays using some inhibitors including anti-human Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4/MD-2 complex monoclonal antibodies showed that the biological activity of synthetic Pg-LA was mediated only through the TLR4 signaling pathway, which might act as a receptor for LPS, whereas TLR2, possibly together with CD14, was associated with the signaling cascade for LPS and native lipid A of P. gingivalis, in addition to the TLR4 pathway. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the moderated and reduced biological activity of P. gingivalis LPS and native lipid A, including their activity on C3H/HeJ mouse cells via the TLR2-mediated pathway, may be mediated by bioactive contaminants or low acylated molecules present in the native preparations having multiple lipid A moieties.
TI  - Early and preferential induction of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M in THP-1 cells by LPS derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - LPS of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is suggested to be a virulence factor in periodontitis, stimulating host cells to produce proinflammatory mediators. However, P. gingivalis LPS has been reported to show lower biological activity compared with Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS. Although differences in the chemical structure of lipid A and the receptor conferring LPS signaling are thought to account for these characteristics, the precise reason is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that P. gingivalis LPS up-regulates IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-M, a negative regulator of the TLR signaling pathway, in a THP-1-derived macrophage more robustly than E. coli LPS. Although down-regulation of IRAK-M by small interfering (si)RNA augmented transcription and translation of TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12 p40 in LPS-stimulated macrophages, the effect of siRNA was more prominent in P. gingivalis LPS-stimulated cells. Degradation of IRAK-1 was more obvious in E. coli LPS-stimulated macrophages than the cells stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, suggesting that P. gingivalis LPS-induced IRAK-M suppressed dissociation of IRAK-1 from the receptor complex, resulting in escape from subsequent degradation. This activity may be involved in the chronic infection of this bacterium in periodontal tissue by serving as an escape mechanism from immune surveillance.
TI  - Resistance of Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 to direct killing by antimicrobial peptides is protease independent.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are short, positively charged, amphipathic peptides that possess a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity and have an important role in the host's innate immunity. Lack of, or dysfunctions in, antimicrobial peptides have been correlated with infectious diseases, including periodontitis. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobe and a major pathogen associated with periodontal diseases, is resistant to antimicrobial peptides of human and nonhuman origin, a feature that likely contributes to its virulence. Expressing a robust proteolytic activity, P. gingivalis hydrolyzes antimicrobial peptides. In this study, P. gingivalis inactivated three antimicrobial peptides, while a d-enantiomer was resistant to degradation. P. gingivalis was resistant to the protease-resistant d-enantiomer peptide, and importantly, a protease-deficient P. gingivalis mutant was also resistant to the antimicrobial peptide. Finally, the binding of a fluorescently labeled antimicrobial peptide to protease-deficient P. gingivalis was much weaker than the binding of susceptible Escherichia coli. Our results suggest that the resistance of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 to direct killing by antimicrobial peptides is protease independent and results (at least partially) from the low affinity of antimicrobial peptides to P. gingivalis.
TI  - Analysis of the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used for dental analgesia.
AB  - Seven local anaesthetics and their active anaesthetic components [Ultracaine D-S  (articaine hydrochloride), Carbostesin (bupivacaine hydrochloride), Scandicaine (mepivacaine hydrochloride), Xylonest (prilocaine hydrochloride), Xylocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride), Hostacaine (butanilicaine phosphate) and Novocaine (procaine hydrochloride)] were tested for their antimicrobial activity against 311 bacterial strains from 52 different species and 14 Candida albicans strains. The tested pathogens were members of the oral flora, and partly members of the skin and intestinal flora. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, sodium disulfite, adrenaline hydrogen tartrate and adrenaline (the preservative and vasoconstrictive components of the anaesthetics) was tested. For determination of MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the agar dilution method using Wilkins-Chalgren agar was applied. The trade preparation Ultracaine D-S showed the most prominent antimicrobial activity with regard to both MIC and MBC. Ultracaine D-S and its active substance, articaine hydrochloride, showed similar MIC values, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity is mainly caused by the anaesthetic component. Novocaine showed the lowest antimicrobial activity and did not inhibit 35 of the species tested. The MIC values of all local anaesthetics were between 0.25 and 16 mg ml(-1). The routinely applied concentration of Ultracaine D-S was roughly four times higher, and of Hostacaine was two times higher, than the MBC values for the tested bacteria, whereas for the other anaesthetics, the MBC values were not reached or exceeded with the concentrations used. The MIC range of the preservatives was 0.5-1.0 mg ml(-1) for methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.2-0.5 mg ml(-1) for sodium disulfite. The articaine MIC values were two to three serial dilution steps lower, and the butanilicaine MIC values one to two serial dilution steps lower, than the MIC of the preservatives. The mepivacaine mean MIC values were slightly lower for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Staphylococcus aureus, but higher for Streptococcus intermedius, compared with the preservative methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. The same result was found with Streptococcus intermedius and lidocaine. Screening of 20 MIC values of 4 pure anaesthetic substances and the corresponding preservative found 2/20 instances where the MICs of the preservatives against 5 representative species (67 strains) were lower, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was mainly due to the preservative, but 18/20 results where the pure anaesthetic component showed greater antimicrobial effects compared with the preservative. The in vitro results for Carbostesin, Scandicaine and especially for Novocaine indicate that a local disinfection should be done prior to injection of the anaesthetics. Due to the results obtained with nosocomial strains (Escherichia coli, S. aureus and Pseudomonas), disinfection of the mucous membranes should be performed routinely in immunocompromised patients, regardless of the anaesthetic used.
TI  - Glycosylation of the OMP85 homolog of Porphyromonas gingivalis and its involvement in biofilm formation.
AB  - OMP85 is a highly conserved outer membrane protein in all Gram-negative bacteria. We studied an uncharacterized OMP85 homolog of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary periodontal pathogen forming subgingival plaque biofilms. Using an outer-loop peptide antibody specific for the OMP85 of P. gingivalis, loop-3 Ab, we found a difference in the mobility of OMP85 on SDS-PAGE gel between the P. gingivalis wild-type and the isogenic galE mutant, a deglycosylated strain, suggesting that OMP85 naturally exists in a glycosylated form. This was also supported by a shift in OMP85 PAGE mobility after chemical deglycosylation treatment. Further, loop-3 Ab cross-reacted with the galE mutant stronger than the wild-type strain; and could inhibit biofilm formation in the galE mutant more than in the wild-type strain. In conclusion, this is the first report providing the evidence of OMP85 glycosylation and the involvement of OMP85 in biofilm formation.
TI  - Stimulation of cells derived from nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth with Porphyromonas gingivalis, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-1beta.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the main contributory factor of nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth either by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Human gingival fibroblasts from healthy tissues and nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth tissues were stimulated with nifedipine, IL-1beta, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (Ec-LPS), and Pg-LPS, and the gene expressions were analyzed by RT-PCR. Analysis of the data showed no strong evidence of a synergistic effect of nifedipine and Pg-LPS on IL-6, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and type 1 collagen gene expression of either healthy cells or nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth cells. Among the three stimulants--IL-1beta, Pg-LPS, and Ec-LPS--androgen receptor and IL-6 gene expressions in both the healthy and nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth groups were strongly up-regulated by the presence of IL-1beta only. Furthermore, the responses to IL-1beta in the nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth group were stronger than those of the healthy group. It can be concluded that IL-1beta is an important mediator responsible for the higher IL-6 and androgen receptor expression of nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth cells.
TI  - Further evidence that major outer membrane proteins homologous to OmpA in Porphyromonas gingivalis stabilize bacterial cells.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the most important bacteria in the progression of chronic periodontal disease. We hypothesized that the major outer membrane proteins Pgm6/7, which are homologous to the OmpA protein in Escherichia coli, might contribute to the stabilization of the cell surface. In this study, the effects of Pgm6/7 on the cell surface were examined morphologically. METHODS: Deletion mutants of Pgm6/7 (Delta694, Delta695 and Delta695-694) were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension method. Wild-type ATCC 33277 and Pgm6/7 mutants were grown under anaerobic conditions. Whole cells and thin sections of fixed cells were stained and examined by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Compared with the wild-type, numerous vesicles released from cells were observed in each deletion mutant. The outer membrane appeared wavy and irregular. Increased numbers of vesicles were confirmed after their preparation from the culture supernatant. Total gingipain activity in vesicles was increased five- to 10-fold in the deletion mutants. CONCLUSION: This report provides further evidence that Pgm6/7 proteins in P. gingivalis play an important role in the maintenance of bacterial outer membrane integrity.
TI  - Stimulatory response of neutrophils from periodontitis patients with periodontal  pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neutrophils play a crucial role in the defense of invading bacteria by releasing biologically active molecules. The response of peripheral blood neutrophils was studied in periodontitis-affected patients and in healthy controls towards stimulation to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) extracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral venous blood was drawn from 23 adult patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis (probing depth >or=5 mm, attachment loss >or=3 mm), and 30 healthy volunteers. Neutrophil response followed by metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion was assayed by zymography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, on both whole blood and purified neutrophils. In addition to periodontal pathogen extracts, known stimulating agents were tested, such as Escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phytohemagglutinin, and zymosan A. RESULTS: Neutrophil response, expressed as a secretion ratio under stimulated and non-stimulated conditions, measured in whole blood, showed no differences between periodontitis and healthy controls. Instead, in purified neutrophils from patients, MMP-9 exhibited a significantly higher secretion ratio with LPS and Pg (1.5- to 2-fold), whereas IL-8 showed a larger increase in secretion ratio (3- to 7-fold) in the presence of Pg, Aa, LPS, and zymosan A. CONCLUSION: Peripheral neutrophils of periodontitis-affected patients are more reactive as suggested by their significantly higher response toward periodontal pathogen extracts and other stimulating agents.
TI  - Kinetic and structural analysis of mutant Escherichia coli dihydroorotases: a flexible loop stabilizes the transition state.
AB  - Dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyzes the reversible cyclization of N-carbamyl-l-aspartate (CA-asp) to l-dihydroorotate (DHO) in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Two different conformations of the surface loop (residues 105-115) were found in the dimeric Escherichia coli DHOase crystallized in the presence of DHO (PDB code 1XGE). The loop asymmetry reflected that of the active site contents of the two subunits: the product, DHO, was bound in the active site of one subunit and the substrate, CA-asp, in the active site of the other. In the substrate- (CA-asp-) bound subunit, the surface loop reaches in toward the active site and makes hydrogen bonds with the bound CA-asp via two threonine residues (Thr109 and Thr110), whereas the loop forms part of the surface of the protein in the product- (DHO-) bound subunit. To investigate the relationship between the structural states of this loop and the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, a series of mutant DHOases including deletion of the flexible loop were generated and characterized kinetically and structurally. Disruption of the hydrogen bonds between the surface loop and the substrate results in significant loss of catalytic activity. Furthermore, structures of these mutants with low catalytic activity have no interpretable electron density for parts of the flexible loop. The structure of the mutant (Delta107-116), in which the flexible loop is deleted, shows only small differences in positions of other substrate binding residues and in the binuclear zinc center compared with the native structure, yet the enzyme has negligible activity. The kinetic and structural analyses suggest that Thr109 and Thr110 in the flexible loop provide productive binding of substrate and stabilize the transition-state intermediate, thereby increasing catalytic activity.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of chromosomal DNA contributes to genetic variation in the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major oral pathogen that contributes to the development of periodontal disease. There is a significant degree of genetic variation among strains of P. gingivalis, and the population structure has been predicted to be panmictic, indicating that horizontal DNA transfer and recombination between strains are likely. The molecular events underlying this genetic exchange are not understood, although a putative type IV secretion system is present in the genome sequence of strain W83, implying that DNA conjugation may be responsible for genetic transfer in these bacteria. In this study, we provide in vitro evidence for the horizontal transfer of DNA using plasmid- and chromosome-based assays. In the plasmid assays, Bacteroides-derived shuttle vectors were tested for transfer from P. gingivalis strains into Escherichia coli. Of the eight strains tested, five were able to transfer DNA into E. coli by a mechanism most consistent with conjugation. Additionally, strains W83 and 33277 tested positive for the transfer of chromosomally integrated antibiotic resistance markers. Ten chimeras resulting from the chromosomal transfer assay were further analyzed by Southern hybridization and were shown to have exchanged DNA fragments of between 1.1 and 5.6 kb, but the overall strain identity remained intact. Chimeras showed phenotypic changes in the ability to accrete into biofilms, implying that DNA transfer events are sufficient to generate measurable changes in complex behaviors. This ability to transfer chromosomal DNA between strains may be an adaptation mechanism in the complex environment of the host oral cavity.
TI  - Periodontal bacterial DNA suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  - Certain CpG motifs found in bacterial DNA enhance immune responses through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. Our objective was to determine if DNA from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral cavity. Streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (GTF), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. Rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-GTF, or alum-GTF together with either Escherichia coli DNA, Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA, or Porphyromonas gingivalis DNA. Contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-GTF plus bacterial DNA (P. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, salivary IgA antibody, and T-cell proliferation to GTF compared to animals immunized with alum-GTF alone. A diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-GTF with the P. gingivalis DNA either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and DNA was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. Since TLR triggering by DNA induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [SOCS]), the effects of P. gingivalis DNA and GTF exposure on rat splenocyte production of SOCS family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. P. gingivalis DNA significantly up-regulated SOCS1 and SOCS5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. These results suggested that DNA from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive SOCS components triggered by innate mechanisms.
TI  - Extended exposure of lipopolysaccharide fraction from Porphyromonas gingivalis facilitates mononuclear cell adhesion to vascular endothelium via Toll-like receptor-2 dependent mechanism.
AB  - Certain infectious pathogens contribute to atherogenesis. Indeed, the strong relationship between periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.) and coronary heart disease has been demonstrated. We investigated the potential role of P.g. in monocyte-endothelial interaction. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fraction was extracted from P.g. cultured under anaerobic conditions and compared to that obtained from an Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain (JM109). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in the presence of P.g.-LPS fraction or E. coli-LPS fraction for various periods and mononuclear cell adhesion assays were conducted under flow. The adhesion of mononuclear cells to HUVECs treated with P.g.-LPS fraction peaked after 24h of incubation, whereas those treated with E. coli-LPS fraction maximized after 4h of incubation. A fluorescent immunobinding assay revealed that P.g.-LPS fraction significantly upregulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HUVECs. Antibodies against ICAM-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, but not TLR-4, attenuated P.g.-LPS fraction-facilitated mononuclear cell adhesion to HUVECs. In conclusion, these results suggest that chronic P.g. infection may facilitate monocyte recruitment to vascular endothelium through sustained upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Our findings provide new evidence that the TLR-2 pathway may contribute to atherogenesis by mediating P.g.-LPS signal transduction.
TI  - The effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans LPS on human dendritic cells in vitro, and in a mouse model in vivo.
AB  - Interaction between different bacterial plaque pathogens and dendritic cells may  induce different types of T helper (Th) cell response, which is critical in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. In this study we investigated the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) with respect to co-stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production and Th cell differentiation. Unlike Escherichia coli and A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, P. gingivalis LPS induced only low levels of CD40, CD80, HLA-DR and CD83 expression on Mo-DCs. LPS from both bacteria induced considerably lower TNF-alpha and IL-10 than did E. coli LPS. LPS from all three bacteria induced only negligible IL-12 production. In a human mixed-leukocyte reaction, and in an ovalbumin-specific T cell response assay in mice, both types of LPS suppressed IFN-gamma production. In conclusion, stimulation by P. gingivalis LPS and A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS appears to bias Mo-DCs towards Th2 production.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 4-dependent recognition of structurally different forms of chemically synthesized lipid As of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic oral black-pigmented bacterium closely associated with chronic periodontitis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from P. gingivalis is shown to be unusual because the LPS contains a greater number of lipid A species, such as tri-, tetra-, and/or penta-acylated lipid As. In this study, a lipid A possessing penta-fatty acyl chains derived from P. gingivalis strain 381 (compound PG-381-5FA) was synthesized, and examined for its immunobiological activities, compared with a tri-acylated lipid A (compound PG-381-3FA) synthesized previously. Compound PG-381-5FA, similar to compound PG-381-3FA, demonstrated weaker activity in a Limulus test as compared with Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A (compound 506). Compound PG-381-5FA, followed by compound PG-381-3FA, induced KC, interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production in peritoneal macrophages from LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice, but not in those from LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice. Furthermore, compound PG-381-5FA, as well as compound PG-381-3FA, activated nuclear factor-kappaB via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4/mD-2, but not TLR2, in a manner similar to compound 506, and worked as an antagonist for compound 506-induced cell activation. In the case of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compound PG-381-5FA showed much stronger IL-6-inducing activity than compound PG-381-3FA. The present results demonstrate that the chemical synthesis of a penta-acylated lipid A, mimicking the natural lipid A portion of LPS from P. gingivalis, is attributable to immune cell activation through TLR4, similar to that of compound 506.
TI  - [Production of interleukin-11 and interleukin-6 in cultured human gingival fibroblasts with the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Escherichia coli (Ec) lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the production of IL-11 and IL-6 from healthy human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), and the effects of endogenous prostaglandin on HGF IL-11 and IL-6 production stimulated with the above LPS. METHODS: HGF were stimulated with Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS of different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L) for 24 h. And HGF were also stimulated with the combinations of 10 mg/L Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS and 10(-6) mol/L indomethacin respectively for 24 h. Levels of IL-11 and IL-6 in the supernatants were quantitated by ELISA. RESULTS: LPS from Aa, Ec, at the concentration of 10 mg/L and from Pg at the concentrations 1, 10 mg/L significantly augmented IL-11 production by HGF. IL-6 production was also significantly increased by stimulation with Aa-LPS at concentrations 1, 10 mg/L and with Ec-, Pg-LPS at concentrations 0.1, 1, 10 mg/L. In addition, IL-11 production was lower than IL-6 production by HGF stimulated with LPS. Indomethacin significantly inhibited IL-6 and IL-11 production in LPS-stimulated HGF. CONCLUSIONS: Aa-, Pg-, Ec-LPS may significantly increase IL-11 and IL-6 level in the supernatants of HGF, and endogenous prostaglandin may upregulate IL-11 and IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated HGF.
TI  - [Cloning of the RgpAcd gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis and its expression in E.  coli].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone the catalytic domain gene sequence of RgpAcd of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and to induce its fusion expression in E. coli. METHODS: The desired DNA fragment RgpAcd was obtained by PCR and was separately sequenced and identified by inserting into inter-vector pMD18-T vector. The correctly fragment was linked with and cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pET-15b. The recombinant expression plasmid which had been confirmed by enzymes digestion was transformed to E. coli competent cells BL21 (DE3) and expression of fusion protein was induced by IPTG. RESULTS: A 1 476 bp specific fragment was obtained and DNA sequencing showed that the fragment was consistent with those of the published. After induction with IPTG, a fusion protein of 5 x 10(4) was visualized on SDS-PAGE gel. CONCLUSION: The protein of RgpAcd will be obtained for further study and its protein was correctly expressed in E. coli BL21 cells.
TI  - Evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in Italy for treatment of canine infections. Of the anaerobic bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by Peptostreptococcus + Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. Of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with Escherichia coli or Pasteurella multocida. Resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. Anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics tested. The emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.
TI  - Interaction of adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide with the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The nature of the interaction between Porphyromonas gingivalis and the multifunctional peptides adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was investigated. Growth of P. gingivalis was not inhibited in the presence of either of these peptides [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)>250 microg mL(-1)]. The ability of the arginine- and lysine-specific proteases from P. gingivalis to breakdown these peptides was investigated. Adrenomedullin and CGRP were incubated with culture supernatants from wild-type and protease gene knockout strains. No significant effect on antimicrobial activity against the indicator organism Escherichia coli BUE55 was found (MIC=6.25 microg mL(-1) in all cases). The role of anionic components on the surface of P. gingivalis, which may alter binding of these cationic peptides, was also investigated in relation to adrenomedullin. Growth of gene knockout strains lacking surface polysaccharide and capsule components was not inhibited (MIC>250 microg mL(-1)). It is suggested that a lack of sensitivity to adrenomedullin and CGRP may enable P. gingivalis to persist in the oral cavity and cause disease.
TI  - Antagonistic lipopolysaccharides block E. coli lipopolysaccharide function at human TLR4 via interaction with the human MD-2 lipopolysaccharide binding site.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides containing underacylated lipid A structures exhibit reduced abilities to activate the human (h) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling pathway and function as potent antagonists against lipopolysaccharides bearing canonical lipid A structures. Expression of underacylated lipopolysaccharides has emerged as a novel mechanism utilized by microbial pathogens to modulate host innate immune responses. Notably, antagonistic lipopolysaccharides are prime therapeutic candidates for combating Gram negative bacterial sepsis. Penta-acylated msbB and tetra-acylated Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides functionally antagonize hexa-acylated Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide-dependent activation of hTLR4 through the coreceptor, hMD-2. Here, the molecular mechanism by which these antagonistic lipopolysaccharides act at hMD-2 is examined. We present evidence that both msbB and P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides are capable of direct binding to hMD-2. These antagonistic lipopolysaccharides can utilize at least two distinct mechanisms to block E. coli lipopolysaccharide-dependent activation of hTLR4. The main mechanism consists of direct competition between the antagonistic lipopolysaccharides and E. coli lipopolysaccharide for the same binding site on hMD-2, while the secondary mechanism involves the ability of antagonistic lipopolysaccharide-hMD-2 complexes to inhibit E. coli lipopolysaccharide-hMD-2 complexes function at hTLR4. It is also shown that both hTLR4 and hMD-2 contribute to the species-specific recognition of msbB and P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides as antagonists at the hTLR4 complex.
TI  - IL-8 and IDO expression by human gingival fibroblasts via TLRs.
AB  - Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), a predominant cell type in tooth-supporting structure, are presently recognized for their active role in the innate immune response. They produce a variety of inflammatory cytokines in response to microbial components such as LPS from the key periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. In this study, we demonstrated that HGFs expressed mRNA of TLRs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, but not TLRs 7, 8, and 10. Stimulation of HGFs with highly purified TLR2 ligand (P. gingivalis LPS), TLR3 ligand (poly(I:C)), TLR4 ligand (Escherichia coli LPS), and TLR5 ligand (Salmonella typhimurium flagellin) led to expression of IL-8 and IDO. A potent TLR 9 ligand, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 had no effect, although HGFs showed a detectable TLR9 mRNA expression. No significant enhancement on IL-8 or IDO expression was observed when HGFs were stimulated with various combinations of TLR ligands. Surprisingly, the TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 was able to specifically inhibit poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 and IDO expression. TNF-alpha enhanced TLR ligand-induced IL-8 production in HGFs, whereas IFN-gamma enhanced TLR ligand-induced IDO expression. HGF production of IDO in response to P. gingivalis LPS, IFN-gamma, or the two in combination inhibited T cell proliferation in MLRs. The observed T cell inhibition could be reversed by addition of either 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan or l-tryptophan. Our results suggest an important role of HGFs not only in orchestrating the innate immune response, but also in dampening potentially harmful hyperactive inflammation in periodontal tissue.
TI  - Hierarchical gene expression profiles of HUVEC stimulated by different lipid A structures obtained from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The ability of lipid A structural variants to elicit unique endothelial cell gene expression was examined by measuring global gene expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using Affymetrix full genome chips. Two lipid A structural variants obtained from Porphyromonas gingivalis designated PgLPS(1435/1449) and PgLPS(1690) as well as LPS obtained from Escherichia coli wild type and an E. coli msbB mutant (missing myristic acid in the lipid A) were examined. Each of these lipid A structures has been shown to interact with TLR4; however, PgLPS(1435/1449) and E. coli msbB LPS have been shown to be TLR4 antagonists while PgLPS(1690) and wild-type E. coli LPS are TLR4 agonists. It was found that PgLPS(1435/1449) and PgLPS(1690) as well as E. coli msbB LPS activated a subset of those genes significantly transcribed in response to E. coli wild-type LPS. Furthermore, the subset of genes expressed in response to the different lipid A structural forms were those most significantly activated by wild-type E. coli LPS demonstrating a hierarchy in TLR4-dependent endothelial cell gene activation. A unique gene expression profile for the weak TLR4 agonist PgLPS(1690) was observed and represents a TLR4 hierarchy in endothelial cell gene activation.
TI  - Non-enterobacterial endotoxins stimulate human coronary artery but not venous endothelial cell activation via Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether non-enterobacterial endotoxins, which are likely  to constitute the majority of the circulating endotoxin pool, may stimulate coronary artery endothelial cell activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Interleukin-8 secretion, monocyte adhesion, and E-selectin expression were measured in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) challenged in vitro with highly purified endotoxins of common host colonisers Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. HCAECs but not HUVECs expressed Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and were responsive to non-enterobacterial endotoxins. Transfection of TLR-deficient HEK-293 cells with TLR2 or TLR4/MD2 revealed that while E. coli endotoxin utilised solely TLR4 to signal, the endotoxins, deglycosylated endotoxins (lipid-A), and whole heat-killed bacteria of the other species stimulated TLR2-but not TLR4-dependent cell-signalling. Blockade of TLR2 with neutralizing antibody prevented HCAEC activation by non-enterobacterial endotoxins. Comparison of each endotoxin with E. coli endotoxin in limulus amoebocyte lysate assay revealed that the non-enterobacterial endotoxins are greatly underestimated by this assay, which has been used in all previous studies to estimate plasma endotoxin concentrations. CONCLUSION: Circulating non-enterobacterial endotoxins may be an underestimated contributor to endothelial activation and atherosclerosis in individuals at risk of increased plasma endotoxin burden.
TI  - Cutting edge: ASC mediates the induction of multiple cytokines by Porphyromonas gingivalis via caspase-1-dependent and -independent pathways.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is a major etiologic agent for chronic periodontitis. Tissue destruction by Pg results partly from induction of host inflammatory responses through TLR2 signaling. This work examines the role of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC), an adaptor molecule important for TLR-mediated caspase-1 activation. Results demonstrate that ASC levels are stable upon infection of human THP1 monocytic cells with Pg but decrease after cytokine induction. Using short hairpin RNA, we demonstrate an essential role for ASC in induction of IL-1beta by TLR2, 4, and 5 agonists, live Escherichia coli, and Pg. Induction of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF also requires ASC, but this induction is not inhibited by IL-1 receptor antagonist or caspase-1 inhibitor. Similar results in U937 indicate broad applicability of these findings. Pg-infected ASC knockdown THP1 cells exhibit reduced transcript levels and NF-kappaB activation. These results suggest a role for ASC in cytokine induction by Pg involving both caspase-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
TI  - Pivotal advance: vasoactive intestinal peptide inhibits up-regulation of human monocyte TLR2 and TLR4 by LPS and differentiation of monocytes to macrophages.
AB  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an immunoregulatory peptide, which inhibits LPS-induced cytokine secretion in myeloid cells and has beneficial effects in animal models of inflammatory diseases. We show for the first time that VIP decreases LPS-induced up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR4 by human monocytic THP1 cells and peripheral blood monocytes (PBM). VIP inhibited up-regulation of TLR4 expression in THP1 cells in response to LPS from Escherichia coli or the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis within 6 h poststimulation but had less of an effect on TLR2. After 24 h, P. gingivalis LPS-stimulated monocytic THP1 cells to differentiate into macrophages, which predominantly expressed TLR2, and E. coli LPS-stimulated THP1 differentiation to predominantly TLR4-expressing macrophages. VIP decreased monocyte differentiation to macrophages induced by LPS from either species and also reduced overall TLR2 and TLR4 expression in these cells. VIP had a similar effect on human PBM. The transcription factor PU.1 regulates TLR expression and has a central role in myeloid cell differentiation. VIP inhibited the nuclear translocation of PU.1 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytes. VIP also inhibited the expression of the M-CSF receptor, which is regulated by PU.1. In summary, VIP inhibited LPS-induced differentiation of monocytes with a concomitant reduction in TLR2 and TLR4 expression. Although there was differential induction of TLR expression by LPS from P. gingivalis and E. coli, VIP inhibited the action of both of these LPS types on monocytes. The mechanism of action of VIP on monocyte differentiation may be via inhibition of the transcription factor PU.1.
TI  - Enzymatic activation of lysine 2,3-aminomutase from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The development of lysine 2,3-aminomutase as a robust biocatalyst hinges on the development of an in vivo activation system to trigger catalysis. This is the first report to show that, in the absence of chemical reductants, lysine 2,3-aminomutase activity is dependent upon the presence of flavodoxin, ferredoxin, or flavodoxin-NADP(+) reductase.
TI  - LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF)-deficient mice express reduced LPS-induced cytokine: Evidence for LITAF-dependent LPS signaling pathways.
AB  - Previously we identified a transcription factor, LPS-Induced TNF-alpha Factor (LITAF), mediating inflammatory cytokine expression in LPS-induced processes. To characterize the role of LITAF in vivo, we generated a macrophage-specific LITAF-deficient mouse (macLITAF(-/-)). Our data demonstrate that in macrophages (i) several cytokines (such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, sTNF-RII, and CXCL16) are induced at lower levels in macLITAF(-/-) compared with LITAF(+/+) control macrophages; (ii) macLITAF(-/-) mice are more resistant to LPS-induced lethality. To further identify LITAF signaling pathways, we tested mouse TLR-2(-/-), -4(-/-), and -9(-/-) and WT peritoneal macrophages exposed to LPS. Using these cells, we now show that LITAF expression can be induced after challenge either with LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis via agonism at TLR-2, or with LPS from Escherichia coli via agonism at TLR-4, both requiring functional MyD88. We also show that, in response to LPS, the MyD88-dependent LITAF pathway differs from the NF-kappaB pathway. Furthermore, using a kinase array, p38alpha was found to mediate LITAF phosphorylation and the inhibition of p38alpha with a p38-specific inhibitor (SB203580) blocked LITAF nuclear translocation and reduced LPS-induced TNF-alpha protein levels. Finally, macLITAF(-/-) macrophages rescued by LITAF cDNA transfection restored levels of TNF-alpha similar to those observed in WT cells. We conclude that LITAF is an important mediator of the LPS-induced inflammatory response that can be distinguished from NF-kappaB pathway and that p38alpha is the specific kinase involved in the pathway linking LPS/MyD88/LITAF to TNF.
TI  - Changes of immunoresponse in BALB/c mice neonatally treated with periodontopathic bacterial endotoxin.
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to analyze the effects of early life exposure to periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides on immunoresponse. Newborn BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with 20 ng lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli daily for 2 days, starting within 24 h after birth. The treated mice were given intraperitoneal injections of bovine serum albumin at 180 and 187 days of age. Seventeen hours after each injection, the mice were bled and sera were separated. Their sera were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. The mean interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-6 and immunoglobulin E levels in the sera of mice treated neonatally with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide were significantly higher than those of the controls. However, in all cases, no significant difference was noted between mice treated neonatally with A. actinomycetemcomitans- or E. coli lipopolysaccharide and control mice. These data suggest that neonatal exposure to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces changes in immunological responses when the mice reach maturity.
TI  - Purification and initial characterization of a novel Porphyromonas gingivalis HmuY protein expressed in Escherichia coli and insect cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis acquires iron and heme from the host environment using gingipains, lipoproteins, and outer-membrane receptors. Recently, we identified and characterized a heme receptor HmuR. The hmuR gene is localized in an operon together with a hmuY gene encoding a putative heme-binding protein. The aim of this study was to overexpress and perform a preliminary analysis of the recombinant HmuY protein. We constructed and examined several recombinant HmuY variants which were overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli and insect cells. Recombinant HmuY protein was expressed in insect cells at levels similar to those in E. coli cells. This protein is predominantly present in a monomeric form but also dimerizes and several other oligomerization forms were found. Hemin and ATP binding to the purified HmuY showed that this protein may play a regulatory function in hemin utilization in P. gingivalis.
TI  - Bacteroides species produce Vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. Bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. Some specific clues led us to hypothesize that Bacteroides species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. First, Bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial infections. These infections often involve Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. Also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in Porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the Bacteroides genus. These and other evidences prompted us to investigate if Bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a Vibrio harveyi reporter system. In this paper, we show that supernatants of B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and B. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the V. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. Also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. Moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. We could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxS gene of Escherichia coli. Altogether, our results show that B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and B. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce V. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. However, the role of such molecules in the biology of these organisms remains unknown.
TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of Candida albicans biofilms.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro Candida albicans biofilm development. A single isolate of C. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species of oral bacteria comprising, Actinomyces israelii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. Biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of Candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. A viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. Co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on Candida biofilm formation. Co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (P<0.05), except for L. acidophilus, S. mutans, and, S. intermedius co-cultures. Further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration of either P. gingivalis or E. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (P<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. Taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate C. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.
TI  - Effect of MUC7 peptides on the growth of bacteria and on Streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the susceptibility of selected bacteria as well as Streptococcus mutans biofilm to MUC7 peptides and compare the activities with those of other known antimicrobial peptides. METHODS: MIC and MBC of peptides for S. mutans, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using the microdilution method. For S. mutans, the effects of the peptides on the kinetics of growth inhibition, time-killing, and on biofilm formation and reduction were also examined. For biofilm studies, polystyrene microtitre plates, Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) and hydroxylapatite (HA) discs, along with Crystal Violet and Alamar Blue dyes, and/or EM observations, were employed. RESULTS: S. mutans was the most susceptible to all peptides tested (MICs of 9.4-25.0 microM), compared with the other species (MICs of 3.1->100 microM). MUC7 peptides (except MUC7-12-mer-L4) exerted 2-fold higher activity against S. mutans than Hsn5-12-mer and magainin-II, and faster killing of S. mutans than Hsn5-12-mer. The MUC7 peptides also had an effect on S. mutans biofilm. On the polystyrene plates, they suppressed the biofilm formation, with MBIC(50) of 6.25-12.5 microM, and reduced the 1 day developed biofilm in a batch culture, with MBRC(50) of 25-50 microM. On the CBD pegs, the viabilities of the biofilm were suppressed by >95% in the presence of MUC7 peptides at 4x MIC (50 microM). One day developed biofilm viabilities were inhibited by 49-75%. On HA, the formation of biofilm (as observed by EM) was also considerably reduced. CONCLUSIONS: MUC7 peptides present somewhat preferential antimicrobial activity against S. mutans. They also have an effect on in vitro formation and reduction of the preformed S. mutans biofilm.
TI  - Role of oxyR in the oral anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is an anaerobic microorganism that inhabits the oral cavity, where oxidative stress represents a constant challenge. A putative transcriptional regulator associated with oxidative stress, an oxyR homologue, is known from the P. gingivalis W83 genome sequence. We used microarrays to characterize the response of P. gingivalis to H2O2 and examine the role of oxyR in the regulation of this response. Most organisms in which oxyR has been investigated are facultative anaerobes or aerobes. In contrast to the OxyR-regulated response of these microorganisms to H2O2, the main feature of the response in P. gingivalis was a concerted up-regulation of insertion sequence elements related to IS1 transposases. Common OxyR-regulated genes such as dps and ahpFC were not positively regulated in P. gingivalis in response to H2O2. However, their expression was dependent on the presence of a functional OxyR, as revealed by microarray comparison of an oxyR mutant to the wild type. Phenotypic characterization of the oxyR mutant showed that OxyR plays a role in both the resistance to H2O2 and the aerotolerance of P. gingivalis. Escherichia coli and other bacteria with more complex respiratory requirements use OxyR for regulating resistance to H2O2 and use a separate regulator for aerotolerance. In P. gingivalis, the presence of a single protein combining the two functions might be related to the comparatively smaller genome size of this anaerobic microorganism. In conclusion, these results suggest that OxyR does not act as a sensor of H2O2 in P. gingivalis but constitutively activates transcription of oxidative-stress-related genes under anaerobic growth.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray characterization of prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - A recombinant form of prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase from Porphyromonas gingivalis has been crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using potassium sodium tartrate as a precipitating agent. The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6(3)22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 149.4, c = 159.7 A. The crystals are most likely to contain one subunit of a dimer in the asymmetric unit, with a VM value of 3.14 A3 Da(-1). Diffraction data were collected to 2.1 A resolution using synchrotron radiation at the BL5 station of the Photon Factory.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. The continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. Macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Escherichia coli. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Regulated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by LPS was evaluated by ELISA. Our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by LPS. This suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Effects of substrate analogues and pH on manganese superoxide dismutases.
AB  - The effect of the substrate analogues azide and fluoride on the manganese(II) zero-field interactions of different manganese-containing superoxide dismutases (SOD) was measured using high-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Two cambialistic types, proteins that are active with manganese or iron, were studied along with two that were only active with iron and another that was only active with manganese. It was found that azide was able to coordinate directly to the pentacoordinated Mn(II) site of only the MnSOD from Escherichia coli and the cambialistic SOD from Rhodobacter capsulatus. The formation of a hexacoordinate azide-bound center was characterized by a large reduction in the Mn(II) zero-field interaction. In contrast, all five SODs were affected by fluoride, but no evidence for hexacoordinate Mn(II) formation was detected. For both azide and fluoride, the extent of binding was no more than 50%, implying either that a second binding site was present or that binding was self-limiting. Only the Mn(II) zero-field interactions of the two SODs that had little or no activity with manganese were found to be significantly affected by pH, the manganese-substituted iron superoxide dismutase from E. coli and the Gly155Thr mutant of the cambialistic SOD from Porphyromonas gingivalis. A model for anion binding and the observed pK involving tyrosine-34 is presented.
TI  - Identification of amino acid residues involved in heme binding and hemoprotein utilization in the Porphyromonas gingivalis heme receptor HmuR.
AB  - We have previously identified and characterized a heme/hemoglobin receptor, HmuR, in Porphyromonas gingivalis. To analyze the conserved amino acid residues of HmuR that may be involved in hemin/hemoprotein binding and utilization, we constructed a series of P. gingivalis A7436 hmuR mutants with amino acid replacements and characterized the ability of these mutants to utilize hemin and hemoproteins. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce mutations H95A, H434A, H95A-H434A, YRAP420-423YAAA, and NPDL442-445NAAA into HmuR in both P. gingivalis and Escherichia coli. Point mutations at H95 and H434 and in the NPDL motif of HmuR resulted in decreased binding to hemin, hemoglobin, and human serum albumin-hemin complex. Notably, mutations of these conserved sites and motifs led to reduced growth of P. gingivalis when human serum was used as the heme source. Analysis using a three-dimensional homology model of HmuR indicated that H95, H434, and the NPDL motif are present on apical or extracellular loops of HmuR, while the YRAP motif is present on the barrel wall. Taken together, these results support a role for H95, H434, and the NPDL motif of the P. gingivalis HmuR protein in heme binding and utilization of serum hemoproteins and the HmuR YRAP motif in serum hemoprotein utilization.
TI  - Expression of a Porphyromonas gingivalis lipid A palmitylacyltransferase in Escherichia coli yields a chimeric lipid A with altered ability to stimulate interleukin-8 secretion.
AB  - In Escherichia coli the gene htrB codes for an acyltransferase that catalyses the incorporation of laurate into lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a lipid A substituent. We describe the cloning, expression and characterization of a Porphyromonas gingivalis htrB homologue. When the htrB homologue was expressed in wild-type E. coli or a mutant strain deficient in htrB, a chimeric LPS with altered lipid A structure was produced. Compared with wild-type E. coli lipid A, the new lipid A species contained a palmitate (C16) in the position normally occupied by laurate (C12) suggesting that the cloned gene performs the same function as E. coli htrB but preferentially transfers the longer-chain palmitic acid that is known to be present in P. gingivalis LPS. LPS was purified from wild-type E. coli, the E. coli htrB mutant strain and the htrB mutant strain expressing the P. gingivalis acyltransferase. LPS from the palmitate bearing chimeric LPS as well as the htrB mutant exhibited a reduced ability to activate human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transfected with TLR4/MD2. LPS from the htrB mutant also had a greatly reduced ability to stimulate interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion in both endothelial cells and monocytes. In contrast, the activity of LPS from the htrB mutant bacteria expressing the P. gingivalis gene displayed wild-type activity to stimulate IL-8 production from endothelial cells but a reduced ability to stimulate IL-8 secretion from monocytes. The intermediate activation observed in monocytes for the chimeric LPS was similar to the pattern seen in HEK293 cells expressing TLR4/MD2 and CD14. Thus, the presence of a longer-chain fatty acid on E. coli lipid A altered the activity of the LPS in monocytes but not endothelial cell assays and the difference in recognition does not appear to be related to differences in Toll-like receptor utilization.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of a super pulsed carbon dioxide laser at low energy density on periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Previous studies have described the effect of irradiation by a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser at high energy density on oral bacteria, and various side-effects have also been observed. However, no published studies have examined the effect of irradiation by a CO2 laser at low energy density on oral bacteria. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of super pulsed CO2 laser irradiation on periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Bacterial suspensions of two species of periodontopathic bacteria received laser irradiation at energy densities of 0-12.5 J/cm2. The suspensions were then spread over agar plates and incubated anaerobically. The bactericidal effects were evaluated based on colony formation. Samples of LPS were laser-irradiated at energy densities of 0-12.5 J/cm2. The biological activity was measured, and LPS was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). RESULTS: The irradiation at low energy densities of 7.5 and 12.5 J/cm2 killed more than 99.9 and 99.999% of Porphyromonas gingivalis and more than 99% of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was sterilized by the irradiation at 7.5 J/cm2. LPS biological activity was significantly decreased by laser irradiation at energy densities of more than 7.5 J/cm2 (p < 0.05), and the components of LPS analyzed by SDS-PAGE was diminished non-specifically. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that CO2 laser irradiation at low power is capable of bactericidal effect on periodontopathic bacteria and decreasing LPS activity.
TI  - Sensitization of human aortic endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide via regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 by bacterial fimbria-dependent invasion.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are differentially up-regulated in response to microbial infection and chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. Epidemiological data support the idea that periodontal disease may be a risk factor for acceleration of atherosclerosis. Porphyromonas gingivalis, the etiological agent of periodontal disease, invades endothelium, has been detected in human atheromatous tissue, and accelerates atheroma formation in apolipoprotein E-/- mice with concurrent induction of TLRs in the aorta. As endothelial cells can present antigen via TLRs and play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis, we examined TLR expression in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) cultured with wild-type P. gingivalis, a fimbria-deficient mutant, and purified antigens. We observed increased TLR expression in HAEC infected with wild-type P. gingivalis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, but not with noninvasive, fimbria-deficient mutant or purified P. gingivalis antigens. Following a wild-type P. gingivalis challenge, functional TLR2 and TLR4 activation was assessed by subsequent stimulation with TLR agonists Staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid (SLTA; TLR2 ligand) and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; TLR4 ligand). Unchallenged HAEC failed to elicit monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in response to LPS or SLTA but did so when cultured with wild-type P. gingivalis. P. gingivalis-induced TLR2 and -4 expression on HAEC functionally reacted to SLTA and E. coli LPS as measured by a further increase in MCP-1 production. Furthermore, MCP-1 expression elicited by E. coli LPS was inhibitable with TLR4-specific antibody and polymyxin B. These results indicate that invasive P. gingivalis stimulates TLR expression on the surface of endothelium and these primed cells respond to defined TLR-specific ligands.
TI  - Multiple Toll-like receptor ligands induce an IL-6 transcriptional response in skeletal myocytes.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) comprise a critical sentinel that monitors body compartments for the presence of pathogens. Skeletal muscle expresses TLRs and responds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by mounting an innate immune response. In the present study, we used C2C12 myocytes as a model system for skeletal muscle during infection. C2C12 cells responded to LPS in a time frame and with a pattern of gene expression that faithfully mimicked the response of skeletal muscle to LPS in vivo. LPS from a variety of Escherichia coli serotypes stimulated IL-6 synthesis. C2C12 cells expressed TLR1-7, but not TLR8 or TLR9, mRNA by RT-PCR. A synthetic tripalmitoylated cysteine-, serine-, and lysine-containing peptide (Pam) and LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis, two TLR2 ligands, also stimulated IL-6 expression. LPS and Pam stimulated luciferase activity driven from NF-kappaB and IL-6 promoter-containing plasmids, and this response was blunted when the NF-kappaB binding site was mutated. LPS- and Pam-stimulated IL-6 expression was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and the IkappaB kinase-2 (IKK2) inhibitor 2-[(aminocarbonyl)amino]-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide (TPCA-1). Pam-stimulated NF-kappaB and IL-6 promoter activities were disrupted by a dominant-negative form of TLR2, but not TLR4. Local injection of LPS or Pam into the gastrocnemius muscle stimulated IL-6 mRNA expression in the injected, but not the contralateral, muscle. The LPS- but not Pam-stimulated expression of IL-6 mRNA was blunted in skeletal muscle of mice carrying an inactivating mutation in TLR4. The data suggest that skeletal muscle and muscle cells recognize pathogen-associated molecules with specific TLRs to initiate an IL-6 transcriptional response.
TI  - Hemagglutinin B is involved in the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to human coronary artery endothelial cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontopathogen that may play a role in cardiovascular diseases. Hemagglutinins may function as adhesins and are required for virulence of several bacterial pathogens. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hemagglutinin B (HagB) in adherence of P. gingivalis to human coronary artery endothelial (HCAE) cells. P. gingivalis strain 381, a P. gingivalis 381 HagB mutant, Escherichia coli JM109 expressing HagB (E. coli-HagB), and E. coli JM109 containing pUC9 (E. coli-pUC9) were tested for their ability to attach to HCAE cells. Inhibition assays were performed to determine the ability of purified recombinant HagB (rHagB) as well as antibodies to HagB, including the polyclonal antibody (PAb) A7985 and the monoclonal antibody (MAb) HL1858, to inhibit the attachment of P. gingivalis to HCAE cells. As expected, when the attachment of P. gingivalis and the HagB mutant were compared, no statistical significance was observed between the two groups (P = 0.331), likely due to the expression of the hagB homolog hagC. However, E. coli-HagB adhered significantly better to HCAE cells than did E. coli-pUC9, the control strain. In a competition assay, the presence of purified rHagB decreased bacterial adhesion of P. gingivalis or E. coli-HagB to HCAE cells. The presence of PAb A7985 or MAb HL1858 also significantly decreased attachment of P. gingivalis and E. coli-HagB to host cells. These results indicate that HagB is involved in the adherence of P. gingivalis to human primary endothelial cells.
TI  - MD-2 mediates the ability of tetra-acylated and penta-acylated lipopolysaccharides to antagonize Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at the TLR4 signaling complex.
AB  - We have demonstrated previously that tetra-acylated LPS derived from the oral bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and penta-acylated msbB LPS derived from a mutant strain of Escherichia coli can antagonize the ability of canonical hexa-acylated E. coli LPS to signal through the TLR4 signaling complex in human endothelial cells. Activation of the TLR4 signaling complex requires the coordinated function of LPS binding protein (LBP), CD14, MD-2, and TLR4. To elucidate the specific molecular components that mediate antagonism, we developed a recombinant human TLR4 signaling complex that displayed efficient LPS-dependent antagonism of E. coli LPS in HEK293 cells. Notably, changes in the expression levels of TLR4 in HEK293 cells modulated the efficiency of antagonism by P. gingivalis LPS. Both soluble (s) CD14 and membrane (m) CD14 supported efficient P. gingivalis LPS-dependent and msbB LPS-dependent antagonism of E. coli LPS in the recombinant TLR4 system. When cells expressing TLR4, MD-2, and mCD14 were exposed to LPS in the absence of serum-derived LBP, efficient LPS-dependent antagonism of E. coli LPS was still observed indicating that LPS-dependent antagonism occurs downstream of LBP. Experiments using immunoprecipitates of sCD14 or sMD-2 that had been pre-exposed to agonist and antagonist indicated that LPS-dependent antagonism occurs partially at sCD14 and potently at sMD-2. This study provides novel evidence that expression levels of TLR4 can modulate the efficiency of LPS-dependent antagonism. However, MD-2 represents the principal molecular component that tetra-acylated P. gingivalis LPS and penta-acylated msbB LPS use to antagonize hexa-acylated E. coli LPS at the TLR4 signaling complex.
TI  - Differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hBD) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (HGE) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: Several strains of the periodontopathogens Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli. The induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also tested. RESULTS: In addition to the published observations (PMA induces hBD-2 and -4; TNF-alpha induces hBD-2 and -3), it was found that PMA can upregulate hBD-1 and hBD-3, whereas TNF-alpha can induce hBD-4. The commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hBD-2, hBD-3, and IL-8. The pathogen P. gingivalis induced hBD-1 and hBD-3 at different time points than the commensals, but no induction of IL-8 and hBD-2 could be observed. These data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. A correlation was found between the pathogenicity of different serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and IL-8. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.
TI  - The effects of intra-amniotic injection of periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides in sheep.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Periodontal disease may cause several complications of pregnancy, including fetal death. The purpose of this study was to investigate in sheep the effects of the intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide from 3 periodontopathic organisms and to compare these effects with those resulting from similar injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The outcomes that were studied included the rates of fetal death and the features of inflammation and lung maturation in survivors. STUDY DESIGN: At 118 days of pregnancy, ewes that were bearing single fetuses were allocated at random to receive intra-amniotic injections of saline solution (n = 13 fetuses), or lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (in doses from 0.1 to 10 mg [n = 22 fetuses]), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 6 fetuses]), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]) or Escherichia coli (10 mg [n = 14 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 7 fetuses]). Surviving fetuses were delivered abdominally at 125 days of gestation (term, 150 days). RESULTS: When compared with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at similar dosages, periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides had high rates of fetal lethality. Only 6 of 22 fetuses that were exposed to intra-amniotic Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide survived doses of 0.1 to 10 mg, and only 3 of 6 fetuses survived 10-mg Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide did not cause fetal loss when given at doses of 10 mg (n = 14 fetuses) or 1 mg (n = 7 fetuses). Fetuses that survived exposure to these lipopolysaccharides showed features of inflammation in amniotic fluid and cord blood at birth and enhanced lung maturation. CONCLUSION: Lipopolysaccharides from these 3 periodontopathic organisms have much higher rates of fetal lethality than Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide but can cause similar intrauterine inflammatory responses and improvements in lung volumes in survivors. Sources of inflammation that are distant from the uterus may underlie a proportion of unexplained stillbirth and other complications of pregnancy.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis in HIV-positive subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP) is a painful and potentially debilitating affliction that affects about 2% to 6% of HIV-positive subjects. NUP may be caused by specific microorganisms that are presently unknown or by microbial species not usually thought to cause periodontal infections. The purpose of this study was to define the bacterial species associated with NUP in HIV-positive patients. METHODS: 16S rRNA bacterial genes of DNA isolated from subgingival plaque of 8 HIV-positive subjects with NUP were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into Escherichia coli. The sequences of cloned inserts were used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences. The microbial profiles in subgingival plaque of subjects with NUP, chronic periodontitis, and periodontal health were compared using a battery of over 200 oligonucleotide probes in a PCR-based, reverse-capture, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of over 400 clones revealed 108 species; 65 were "uncultivable" phylotypes, of which 26 were novel to NUP subjects. Species or phylotypes most commonly detected were Bulleidia extructa, Dialister, Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, and the phylum TM7. Based on sequence analysis and checkerboard analysis, NUP did not possess the classical periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis. Otherwise, the microbial profiles of NUP and periodontitis had many similarities. The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque from periodontally healthy subjects were different and less complex in comparison to the profiles of both disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: Certain species appear to be associated with health and periodontal diseases. The putative pathogens associated with periodontal disease in HIV-negative subjects are not associated with NUP in HIV-positive subjects.
TI  - Effectiveness of the B subunit of cholera toxin in potentiating immune responses  to the recombinant hemagglutinin/adhesin domain of the gingipain Kgp from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The hemagglutinin/adhesin HArep domain is present in the gingipains HRgpA and Kgp and in the hemagglutinin HagA of Porphyromonas gingivalis and is felt to be important in the virulence of this bacterium. In the present study, we determined the immunogenicity of recombinant HArep from the gingipain Kgp (termed Kgp-rHArep) and the effectiveness of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), compared to other adjuvants in potentiating a specific response to Kgp-rHArep following intranasal (i.n.) immunization of mice. Furthermore, we determined the effectiveness of anti-Kgp-rHArep antibodies in protection against P. gingivalis invasion of epithelial cells. Evidence is provided that Kgp-rHArep was effective in inducing immune responses following systemic or mucosal immunization. Kgp-rHArep induced both a Th1- and Th2-type response following i.n. immunization. Immunization of mice with Kgp-rHArep and CTB, either admixed or chemically conjugated to the antigen, via the i.n. route, resulted in a significant augmentation of the systemic and mucosal immune response to Kgp-rHArep, which was similar to or higher than the responses seen in mice immunized with antigen and the other adjuvants tested. CTB and the heat-labile toxin of Escherichia coli potentiated a Th1- and Th2-type response to Kgp-rHArep, whereas the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A preferentially promoted a Th1-type response to the antigen. Furthermore, anti-Kgp-rHArep antibodies were shown to protect against P. gingivalis invasion of epithelial cells in an in vitro system. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of certain mucosal adjuvants in potentiating and in altering the nature of the immune response to Kgp-rHArep following i.n. immunization, and provide evidence for the potential usefulness of Kgp-rHArep for the development of a vaccine against periodontal disease.
TI  - A novel Porphyromonas gingivalis FeoB plays a role in manganese accumulation.
AB  - FeoB is an atypical transporter that has been shown to exclusively mediate ferrous ion transport in some bacteria. Unusually the genome of the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has two genes (feoB1 and feoB2) encoding FeoB homologs, both of which are expressed in bicistronic operons. Kinetic analysis of ferrous ion transport by P. gingivalis W50 revealed the presence of a single, high affinity system with a K(t) of 0.31 microM. FeoB1 was found to be solely responsible for this transport as energized cells of the isogenic FeoB1 mutant (W50FB1) did not transport radiolabeled iron, while the isogenic FeoB2 mutant (W50FB2) transported radiolabeled iron at a rate similar to wild type. This was reflected in the iron content of W50FB1 grown in iron excess conditions which was approximately half that of the wild type and W50FB2. The W50FB1 mutant had increased sensitivity to both oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and was avirulent in an animal model of infection whereas W50FB2 exhibited the same virulence as the wild type. Analysis of manganous ion uptake using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry revealed a greater than 3-fold decrease in intracellular manganese accumulation in W50FB2 which was also unable to grow in manganese-limited media. The protein co-expressed with FeoB2 appears to be a novel FeoA-MntR fusion protein that exhibits homology to a manganese-responsive, DNA-binding metalloregulatory protein. These results indicate that FeoB2 is not involved in iron transport but plays a novel role in manganese transport.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide preparation extracted from Porphyromonas gingivalis lipoprotein-deficient mutant shows a marked decrease in toll-like receptor 2-mediated signaling.
AB  - We recently demonstrated that a new PG1828-encoded lipoprotein (PG1828LP) was able to be separated from a Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparation, and we found that it exhibited strong cell activation, similar to that of Escherichia coli LPS, through a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent pathway. In order to determine the virulence of PG1828LP toward cell activation, we generated a PG1828-deficient mutant of P. gingivalis strain 381 by allelic exchange mutagenesis using an ermF-ermAM antibiotic resistance cassette. A highly purified preparation of LPS from a PG1828-deficient mutant (DeltaPG1828-LPS) showed nearly the same ladder-like patterns in silver-stained gels as a preparation of LPS from a wild-type strain (WT-LPS), as well as Limulus amoebocyte lysate activities that were similar to those of the WT-LPS preparation. However, the ability of the DeltaPG1828-LPS preparation to activate NF-kappaB in TLR2-expressing cells was markedly attenuated. Cytokine production by human gingival fibroblasts was also decreased in response to the DeltaPG1828-LPS preparation in comparison with the WT-LPS preparation, and the activity was comparable to the stimulation of highly purified lipid A of P. gingivalis by TLR4. Further, lethal toxicity was rarely observed following intraperitoneal injection of the PG1828-deficient mutant into mice compared to that with the wild-type strain, while the DeltaPG1828-LPS preparation showed no lethal toxicity. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that PG1828LP plays an essential role in inflammatory responses and may be a major virulence factor of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) blocks P. gingivalis- and F. nucleatum, but not  E. coli, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production in adipocytes.
AB  - An elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP) predicts the future development of  coronary heart disease. Periodontitis appears to up-regulate CRP. CRP is produced by hepatocytes in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6). A major source of IL-6 in obese subjects is adipocytes. We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontal pathogens stimulated adipocytes to produce IL-6, and that the production was suppressed by the drugs targeted against insulin resistance, thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone), since this agent potentially showed an anti-inflammatory effect. Mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with E. coli, P. gingivalis, and F. nucleatum LPS. The IL-6 concentration in culture supernatants was measured. All LPS stimulated adipocytes to produce IL-6. Although pioglitazone changed adipocyte appearance from large to small, and completely suppressed P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum LPS-induced IL-6 production, E. coli LPS-induced IL-6 production was not efficiently blocked. Thus, pioglitazone completely blocked periodontal-bacteria-derived LPS-induced IL-6 production in adipocytes, a major inducer of CRP.
TI  - Oral mucosal endotoxin tolerance induction in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - The oral mucosa is exposed to a high density and diversity of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but very little is known about how immune homeostasis is maintained in this environment, particularly in the inflammatory disease chronic periodontitis (CP). The cells of the innate immune response recognize bacterial structures via the Toll-like receptors (TLR). This activates intracellular signaling and transcription of proteins essential for the induction of an adaptive immune response; however, if unregulated, it can lead to destructive inflammatory responses. Using single-immunoenzyme labeling, we show that the human oral mucosa (gingiva) is infiltrated by large numbers of TLR2(+) and TLR4(+) cells and that their numbers increase significantly in CP, relative to health (P < 0.05, Student's t test). We also show that the numbers of TLR2(+) but not TLR4(+) cells increase linearly with inflammation (r(2) = 0.33, P < 0.05). Double-immunofluorescence analysis confirms that TLR2 is coexpressed by monocytes (MC)/macrophages (mphi) in situ. Further analysis of gingival tissues by quantitative real-time PCR, however, indicates that despite a threefold increase in the expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA during CP, there is significant (30-fold) downregulation of TLR2 mRNA (P < 0.05, Student's t test). Also showing similar trends are the levels of TLR4 (ninefold reduction), TLR5 (twofold reduction), and MD-2 (sevenfold reduction) mRNA in CP patients compared to healthy persons, while the level of CD14 was unchanged. In vitro studies with human MC indicate that MC respond to an initial stimulus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PgLPS) or Escherichia coli (EcLPS) by upregulation of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein; moreover, IL-1beta mRNA is induced and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, IL-6, and IL-8 proteins are secreted. However, restimulation of MC with either PgLPS or EcLPS downregulates TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein and IL-1beta mRNA and induces a ca. 10-fold reduction in TNF-alpha secretion, suggesting the induction of endotoxin tolerance by either LPS. Less susceptible to tolerance than TNF-alpha were IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8. These studies suggest that certain components of the innate oral mucosal immune response, most notably TLRs and inflammatory cytokines, may become tolerized during sustained exposure to bacterial structures such as LPS and that this may be one mechanism used in the oral mucosa to attempt to regulate local immune responses.
TI  - Trimeric structure of major outer membrane proteins homologous to OmpA in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The major outer membrane proteins Pgm6 (41 kDa) and Pgm7 (40 kDa) of Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 are encoded by open reading frames pg0695 and pg0694, respectively, which form a single operon. Pgm6 and Pgm7 (Pgm6/7) have a high degree of similarity to Escherichia coli OmpA in the C-terminal region and are predicted to form eight-stranded beta-barrels in the N-terminal region. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Pgm6/7 appear as bands with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 120 kDa, with and without a reducing agent, suggesting a monomer and trimer, respectively. To verify the predicted trimeric structure and function of Pgm6/7, we constructed three mutants with pg0695, pg0694, or both deleted. The double mutant produced no Pgm6/7. The single-deletion mutants appeared to contain less Pgm7 and Pgm6 and to form homotrimers that migrated slightly faster (115 kDa) and slower (130 kDa), respectively, than wild-type Pgm6/7 under nonreducing conditions. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of partially digested Pgm6/7 detected only fragments from Pgm6 and Pgm7. Two-dimensional, diagonal electrophoresis and chemical cross-linking experiments with or without a reducing agent clearly showed that Pgm6/7 mainly form stable heterotrimers via intermolecular disulfide bonds. Furthermore, growth retardation and arrest of the three mutants and increased permeability of their outer membranes indicated that Pgm6/7 play an important role in outer membrane integrity. Based on results of liposome swelling experiments, these proteins are likely to function as a stabilizer of the cell wall rather than as a major porin in this organism.
TI  - A comprehensive study on the immunological reactivity of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone.
AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis being the most implicated pathogen. In the present study, we investigated the role of P. gingivalis HtpG (PgHtpG), a bacterial ortholog of mammalian Hsp90, in the growth of P. gingivalis and also assessed the immunological cross-reactivity of the members of the Hsp90 family. Antiserum against rat liver Hsp90 potently reacted with yeast Hsp90, called Hsc82, and also weakly with human Hsp90 (hHsp90) and human mitochondrial paralog Trap1, but did not react with PgHtpG, Escherichia coli HtpG, or human endoplasmic reticulum paralog Grp94. Moreover, among 19 monoclonal antibodies raised against hHsp90, nine cross-reacted with yeast Hsc82, and one with human Grp94, but none bound to PgHtpG or E. coli HtpG. Among them, three mAbs that strongly reacted with yeast Hsc82 recognized Asn(291)-Ile(304), a conserved region of the family protein. The polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide, Met(315)-Glu(328), of human Grp94, which corresponded to the conserved region of hHsp90, cross-reacted with hHsp90, but not with other Hsp90-family members. Thus, although mammalian Hsp90 shares some immunological reactivity with yeast Hsc82, human Grp94, and human Trap1, it is considerably distinct from its bacterial ortholog, HtpG. Disruption of the P. gingivalis htpG gene neither affected bacterial survival nor altered the sensitivity of P. gingivalis to various forms of stress.
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine is removed by a nucleotide excision repair-like mechanism in Porphyromonas gingivalis W83.
AB  - A consequence of oxidative stress is DNA damage. The survival of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the inflammatory microenvironment of the periodontal pocket requires an ability to overcome oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) is typical of oxidative damage induced by ROS. There is no information on the presence of 8-oxoG in P. gingivalis under oxidative stress conditions or on a putative mechanism for its repair. High-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection analysis of chromosomal DNA revealed higher levels of 8-oxoG in P. gingivalis FLL92, a nonpigmented isogenic mutant, than in the wild-type strain. 8-oxoG repair activity was also increased in cell extracts from P. gingivalis FLL92 compared to those from the parent strain. Enzymatic removal of 8-oxoG was catalyzed by a nucleotide excision repair (NER)-like mechanism rather than the base excision repair (BER) observed in Escherichia coli. In addition, in comparison with other anaerobic periodontal pathogens, the removal of 8-oxoG was unique to P. gingivalis. Taken together, the increased 8-oxoG levels in P. gingivalis FLL92 could further support a role for the hemin layer as a unique mechanism in oxidative stress resistance in this organism. In addition, this is the first observation of an NER-like mechanism as the major mechanism for removal of 8-oxoG in P. gingivalis.
TI  - Subcloning of the 200-kDa Porphyromonas gingivalis antigen gene and inhibition of hemagglutination by an antibody against the recombinant protein.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiologic agent of periodontitis and exhibits hemagglutinating and adherence activities. We previously succeeded in molecular cloning the 200-kDa cell-surface antigenic protein (200-k AP), designated pMD101, that is recognized in sera from periodontitis patients, and identified the 200-k AP as a hemagglutinin A (HagA) derivative. HagA is one of the hemagglutinins known to be a useful vaccine against periodontitis. HagA has four large, contiguous, direct repeats and the repeat unit is believed to contain the hemagglutinin domain. Because production of 200-k AP was low in the Escherichia coli host, it was difficult to obtain large amounts of recombinant protein. In this study, we attempt to subclone the gene encoding the useful antigen from pMD101 in an effort to obtain large quantities. A subclone, designated pMD160, encoding a fusion protein of 80-kDa HagA and maltose-binding protein was successfully constructed, and the novel clone produced relatively large amounts of recombinant protein. DNA nucleotide sequences of the pMD160 insert demonstrated that the 80-kDa protein contained a short hemagglutinin motif and a direct repeat unit region. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity and rabbit antiserum was raised. The antibody was capable of inhibiting the hemagglutinating activity of P. gingivalis. These findings suggest that novel 80-kDa HagA derivative proteins can be produced efficiently from E. coli hosts and these may be useful in developing immunotherapy against periodontitis infected by P. gingivalis.
TI  - Expression, purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of dipeptidyl  peptidase IV from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The asaccharolytic periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis produces membrane-anchored proteases such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV that are involved in the destruction of host periodontal tissue. The extracellular domain of this enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal His-tag fusion protein, purified using standard metal-affinity chromatography and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique in 40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Diffraction data to 2.7 A resolution were collected using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belong to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 117.0, b = 112.9, c = 310.0 A, beta = 95.0 degrees. There are ten molecules per asymmetric unit, indicating a solvent content of 50%. Data were also collected from selenomethionine-derived crystals and structure solution by SAD or MAD is in progress.
TI  - Reduced expression of gamma interferon in serum and marked lymphoid depletion induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis increase murine morbidity and mortality due to cytomegalovirus infection.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobe, is a major etiological agent  of severe forms of periodontal disease. Although periodontal disease is considered a localized disease, accumulating evidence indicates that it may lead to a predisposition to a decline in immunocompetence. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) commonly infects all human populations without producing significant clinical symptoms. Immunocompromised patients usually develop a primary or reactivated CMV infection, which is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine whether P. gingivalis increases animal susceptibility to CMV infection. Mice were inoculated with CMV and infected locally with P. gingivalis 3 days after the virus inoculation. Mortality rates were monitored, and traces of viral DNA and bacterial infection were detected systemically by using real-time PCR. Local and systemic cytokine secretion was measured, and histological sections were used to assess the pathological state of infected organs. P. gingivalis- and CMV-coinfected mice showed dramatically higher mortality rates than mice infected with P. gingivalis or CMV only. Although the organs of coinfected mice exhibited decreased viral titers, distinct necrosis and tissue damage were more evident in the livers and spleens of these mice than in those of mice infected with CMV only. Furthermore, systemic gamma interferon levels were decreased in coinfected mice, and marked lymphoid depletion was observed in their necrotic organs. In parallel control Escherichia coli-CMV coinfection experiments, the mortality and pathological results were the same as those found in mice infected with CMV only. Our results suggest a specific influence of P. gingivalis on the mouse immune response, causing increased susceptibility to CMV infection.
TI  - Separation and structural analysis of lipoprotein in a lipopolysaccharide preparation from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations from the periodontopathic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg-LPS) are thought to require Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 rather than TLR4, a receptor of Escherichia coli LPS (Ec-LPS), for activation of immune cells. However, we previously reported that P. gingivalis lipid A, an immunostimulatory principal component of LPS, and its synthetic counterpart activate cells through a TLR4-dependent pathway but not via TLR2. In the present study, a lipoprotein from Pg-LPS (Pg-LP) was shown to be a principal component for TLR2-mediated cell activation. Pg-LP was separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by preparative electrophoresis and identified by internal peptide sequencing as PG1828, a putative lipoprotein encoded in the P. gingivalis genome. The N-terminal structure was characterized as a triacylated lipopeptide using mass spectrometry. Pg-LP, as well as Ec-LPS, was potent in inducing IL-8 production in human gingival fibroblasts. From our results, we propose that Pg-LP is a powerful inflammatory factor of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. Placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. The 10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. Six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. METHODS: Oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. The distance implant bone (DIB) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. The levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using DNA probe technology. Additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. RESULTS: The peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, and Treponema denticola were not detected. Low levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Eikenella corrodens were found. Prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). The mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. The antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.
TI  - Microbial DNA induces a host defense reaction of human respiratory epithelial cells.
AB  - Epithelial cells represent the initial site of bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract. TLR9 has been identified in B cells and CD 123(+) dendritic cells and found to be involved in the recognition of microbial DNA. It was the aim of the study to investigate the role of TLR9 in the host defense reactions of the respiratory epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cell lines (IHAEo(-), Calu-3) or fully differentiated primary human cells as air-liquid interface cultures were stimulated with bacterial DNA or synthetic oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG oligodeoxynucleotides). Expression of TLR9, cytokines, and human beta-defensin 2 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR or by ELISA. We found that TLR9 is expressed by respiratory epithelial cell lines and fully differentiated primary epithelial cells at low levels. Stimulation of the above-mentioned cells with bacterial DNA or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide resulted in an inflammatory reaction characterized by a dose-dependent up-regulation of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) and human beta-defensin 2. Up-regulation of NF-kappaB in epithelial cells in response to the CpG motif containing DNA was inhibited by overexpression of a dominant negative form of MyD88. These results provide clear evidence that the human respiratory epithelium is capable of detecting microbial DNA by TLR9. The respiratory epithelium has an important function in triggering innate immune responses and therefore represents an interesting target for anti-inflammatory therapy.
TI  - Alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase subunit C (ahpC) protects against organic peroxides but does not affect the virulence of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83.
AB  - The cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpC) gene complemented an ahpC defect in Escherichia coli. To study the role of ahpC in protecting against oxidative stress in P. gingivalis a 1.8 kb fragment containing the ahpC gene was amplified from the chromosome of P. gingivalis W83. This gene was insertionally inactivated using the ermF-ermAM antibiotic resistance cassette and used to create a ahpC-deficient mutant by allelic exchange. One mutant strain, designated FLL141, demonstrated no change in the growth rate, black pigmentation, beta-hemolysis or level of proteolytic activity compared to the parent strain. Although P. gingivalis FLL141 was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than the parent strain, there was no change in its virulence potential in the mouse model compared to the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the ahpC gene plays a role in peroxide resistance in P. gingivalis but does not contribute significantly to virulence.
TI  - Loss of lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 from the surface of human macrophage-like cells mediated by Porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, the major etiologic agent of chronic periodontitis, produces a broad spectrum of virulence factors, including outer membrane vesicles. In this study, we investigated the capacity of P. gingivalis vesicles to promote the shedding or cleavage of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor CD14 from the surface of human U937 macrophage-like cells. SDS-PAGE/Western immunoblotting analysis of gingival crevicular fluid samples from patients affected by moderate or advanced periodontitis revealed the presence of soluble CD14 and CD14 fragments, thus supporting the hypothesis of an in vivo shedding and cleavage of CD14 receptors. Flow cytometry analysis of macrophage-like cells treated with a vesicle-containing culture supernatant of P. gingivalis showed a significant decrease in the binding of anti-human CD14 to the cell surface. However, no accumulation of soluble CD14 or immunoreactive CD14 fragments in the assay supernatant could be demonstrated by ELISA. Treatment of macrophage-like cells with various concentrations of P. gingivalis vesicles substantially suppressed TNF-alpha production triggered by Escherichia coli LPS. This suppressive effect was much less important using heat-treated vesicles or in the presence of leupeptin, a gingipain inhibitor, during the treatment. Recombinant human CD14 receptors were found to be susceptible to proteolytic degradation by P. gingivalis vesicles. A purified Arg-gingipain preparation produced much more degradation than a Lys-gingipain preparation. This study provides evidence that P. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles contribute to the loss of membrane-bound CD14 receptors and that gingipains degrade this LPS receptor. Such a phenomenon, which results in an hyporesponsiveness of macrophages to LPS stimulation, may contribute to an increased capacity of P. gingivalis, and other periodontopathogens, to evade the host immune system mechanisms.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides induce maturation of dendritic cells with CD14+CD16+ phenotype.
AB  - Primary immune responses are initiated by dendritic cells (DC) that inform naive  T helper cells about invading pathogens. DC undergo sequential events leading to irreversible maturation upon bacterial stimulation. To investigate the responses of DC during periodontal infection, we studied the effects of LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis on DC. DC generated from human peripheral monocytes by culture with IL-4 and GM-CSF were incubated with P. gingivalis LPS (Pg LPS) or Escherichia coli LPS (Ec LPS). Flow cytometry and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that Pg LPS, but not Ec LPS, preferentially up-regulated CD14 and CD16 expression at protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, Pg LPS preferentially induced the secretion of soluble CD14. CD1a, HLA-DR and CD54 were highly expressed on DC stimulated with both kinds of LPS; however, CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86 expression on Pg LPS-stimulated DC was lower than on Ec LPS-stimulated DC. With regard to IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and RANTES production from DC and allogeneic T cell proliferation, Pg LPS was a weaker stimulator than Ec LPS. These results suggested that Pg LPS triggers maturation of DC with unique characteristics, which exhibited weak immunostimulatory activity and may contribute to induction of chronic inflammation at the site of periodontal infection.
TI  - Induction of calprotectin release by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  - Calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. This protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory gingival tissue with periodontal disease. Recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. However, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. Neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P-LPS), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli. Calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by ELISA. Two subunits (10 and 14 kDa) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. P-LPS increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). Lipopolysaccharides from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and E. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. These results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.
TI  - Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
TI  - The induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells by a heat-stable component of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Live Porphyromonas gingivalis enhanced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a bacterial dose-dependent manner. Inactivation of P. gingivalis by ultraviolet (UV), heat (56 degrees C, 30 min), or sonication did not alter its stimulatory activity. ICAM-1 expression began to increase at 4 h after stimulation, reached a maximum at 12 h, and remained at the maximum for at least the next 8 h. This time course was similar to that of expression by Escherichia coli LPS. Furthermore, the effect of UV-inactivated P. gingivalis was not inhibited by boiling or polymyxin B treatment. In addition, the effect of P. gingivalis strain W83 on ICAM-1 expression was stronger than that of strain ATCC 33277. Our results suggested that some unidentified, heat-stable proteins, polysaccharides, or lipids may be the stimulatory factor(s), although the participation of LPS could not be completely ruled out. The ability of P. gingivalis to stimulate ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.
TI  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for Porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  - Cohesive interactions between Porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as Streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role in the colonization of P. gingivalis in periodontal sites. Although P. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with S. oralis, the S. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. We identified the coadhesin of S. oralis ATCC 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. We found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kDa. Dot blot and Western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kDa protein to P. gingivalis fimbriae. Further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between P. gingivalis and S. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. Analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Next, we cloned the gene that encodes S. oralis GAPDH and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of GAPDHs of various bacteria, including Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. To confirm the contribution of S. oralis GAPDH to the interaction with P. gingivalis, a recombinant GAPDH protein was generated in Escherichia coli; this protein bound to P. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. These results suggest that S. oralis GAPDH functions as a coadhesin for P. gingivalis fimbriae. In addition, considering the high degree of homology of the GAPDHs of various bacteria, those of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. We thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. METHODS: Autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel, subgingival calculus, and root caries. Periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. RESULTS: Subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. The calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655 nm. The autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. However, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or blood clots. For clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. CONCLUSION: The autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting subgingival calculus and root caries.
TI  - Expression of CD73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase on human gingival fibroblasts and contribution to the inhibition of interleukin-1alpha-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor production.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CD73/5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) is an ectoenzyme that participates in immune/inflammatory reactions. We examined the possible expression of CD73/5'-NT on human gingival fibroblasts (hGF), which are important to the immune/inflammatory system in periodontal tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrated that CD73/5'-NT was expressed on hGF by flow cytometry. We found that pre-treatment of hGF with 5'-AMP induced marked inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production from hGF upon stimulation with interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A specific inhibitor of 5'-NT, adenosine 5'-[alpha,beta-methylene] diphosphate blocked the inhibition of GM-CSF production, suggesting that adenosine converted from 5'-AMP acts on the inhibitory effects. The GM-CSF inhibition suggested that A3 receptor might be involved. The rank order of agonists was found to be (N6-benzyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) A3 receptor agonist > or = (2-chloroadenosine) non-selective agonist > (CGS-21680) A2A receptor agonist > adenosine > or = (N6-cyclohexyladenosine) A1 agonist. Further support for the main role of A3 receptor was the binding A3 antagonist [9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-5-([phenylacetyl]amino)[1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]quinazdine] reversed the effect of adenosine, but no significant reverse was observed by A1 (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine), A2 [3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-propargyl)xanthine], A2A[8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine], and A2B (alloxazine) antagonists. The CD73/5'-NT expression was increased upon stimulation with gamma-interferon, but not other stimulants such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-4, lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli, and fimbriae from P. gingivalis, and this increase was correlated with the enhanced GM-CSF inhibition by 5'-AMP but not adenosine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that CD73/5'-NT on hGF exerts an anti-inflammatory effects in periodontal disease by conversion from 5'-AMP to adenosine.
TI  - Characterization of two outer membrane protein antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis that are protective in a murine lesion model.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key periodontal pathogen that has been implicated in the aetiology of chronic adult periodontitis. The aim of this study was to characterize two potential vaccine candidates (PG32 and PG33) identified from a previous genomic sequence analysis. Gene knockout studies suggested that these proteins play an important role in bacterial growth and are transcriptionally linked. Analysis of 14 laboratory and clinical isolates of P. gingivalis found that in all strains, both genes were present with a high level of conservation and that the two proteins were also expressed in vitro. Truncated recombinant PG32 and PG33 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli in an attempt to increase the solubility of the proteins while retaining their native conformation. While most of the truncated proteins remained insoluble, two truncated proteins showed good solubility and high levels of protection in the P. gingivalis murine lesion model and may be considered as potential vaccine candidates for further testing in models of human periodontal disease.
TI  - Antibody responses of periodontitis patients to gingipains of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arginine- and lysine-specific cysteine proteinases (arg-gingipain: Rgp, lys-gingipain: Kgp) are major virulence factors of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Recent reports have suggested that antibodies against gingipains can play a protective role against infection by P. gingivalis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the IgG responses of patients with periodontitis to functional domains of gingipains. METHODS: A group of 29 periodontitis patients and 10 periodontally healthy subjects (control group) were recruited into this study. We prepared three recombinant fragments of rgp A (catalytic domain; r-Rgp CAT) and two hemagglutinin domains (r-Rgp 44, and r-Rgps 15-27) corresponding to amino acid residues 228 to 719, 720 to 1136, and 1137 to 1704, respectively. One fragment of the Kgp catalytic domain (r-Kgp CAT) corresponding to amino acid residues 229 to 737 and expressed in Escherichia coli was also used. IgG antibody levels to these recombinant proteins in sera from the subjects were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: We found that IgG levels against r-Rgp 44 and r-Rgps 15-27 in sera obtained from the patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy group (P<0.01). In contrast, no significant differences in IgG levels against r-Rgp CAT and r-Kgp CAT were found between the control and patient groups. The IgG responses to P. gingivalis sonic extracts, r-Rgp 44 and r-Rgps 15-27, were related to probing depth in sera from patients, but those to r-Rgp CAT and r-Kgp CAT were not. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that the low responsiveness of IgG antibody against the catalytic domains of gingipain, r-Rgp CAT, and r-Kgp CAT is a key factor in infection by P. gingivalis.
TI  - The influence of organic load on the antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate bacterial growth after contact with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl;  1 and 5%) and chlorhexidine (CHX; 0.12, 0.5 and 1%) in vitro with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin (BSA) 0.5%). METHODOLOGY: Bacterial samples (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for varying intervals of time: immediately (t0), 5 min (t5), 15 min (t15) and 30 min (t30). Each test was repeated 10 times. In half of the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added as organic material in an attempt to simulate the organic tissue present in the root canal system. Bacterial growth under appropriate condition of incubation was evaluated and compared for each microorganism at all time intervals. RESULTS: A 0.12% CHX solution did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval. One percent CHX eliminated all strains, as did both NaOCl concentrations. BSA did not interfere substantially with the antimicrobial activity of any of the irrigating solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Under the condition of this study, a 0.12% CHX solution was ineffective at killing E. faecalis.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide antagonizes Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at toll-like receptor 4 in human endothelial cells.
AB  - E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces cytokine and adhesion molecule expression via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling complex in human endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS antagonizes E. coli LPS-dependent activation of human endothelial cells. P. gingivalis LPS at 1 micro g/ml inhibited both E. coli LPS (10 ng/ml) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein (HSP) 60.1 (10 micro g/ml) stimulation of E-selectin mRNA expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) without inhibiting interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) stimulation. P. gingivalis LPS (1 micro g/ml) also blocked both E. coli LPS-dependent and M. tuberculosis HSP60.1-dependent but not IL-1beta-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in human microvascular endothelial (HMEC-1) cells, consistent with antagonism occurring upstream from the TLR/IL-1 receptor adaptor protein, MyD88. Surprisingly, P. gingivalis LPS weakly but significantly activated NF-kappaB in HMEC-1 cells in the absence of E. coli LPS, and the P. gingivalis LPS-dependent agonism was blocked by transient expression of a dominant negative murine TLR4. Pretreatment of HUVECs with P. gingivalis LPS did not influence the ability of E. coli LPS to stimulate E-selectin mRNA expression. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence that P. gingivalis LPS-dependent antagonism of E. coli LPS in human endothelial cells likely involves the ability of P. gingivalis LPS to directly compete with E. coli LPS at the TLR4 signaling complex.
TI  - Peptidase activity of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis is important but not sufficient for virulence.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a pathogen associated with adult periodontitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by breakdown of the periodontal tissue. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPPIV) produced by P. gingivalis has been considered to be a potential virulence factor based on the finding that the virulence was reduced by disruption of the gene (dpp ) coding for DPPIV. In the present study, we constructed a shuttle vector that is mobilized from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis and is maintained stably in both bacteria, and we showed that the virulence was restored by introducing the cloned wild-type dpp gene into the null mutant of P. gingivalis using our vector system. To assess the implications of the peptidase activity in the virulence, mutant DPPIV with the catalytic Ser mutagenized to Ala (DPPSA) was produced. The P. gingivalis strain expressing DPPSA exhibited an intermediate virulence between the strain expressing wild-type DPPIV and the strain harboring a vector. From these results, it is suggested that peptidase activity is very important but not sufficient for virulence.
TI  - Gingival and dermal fibroblasts produce interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme and  interleukin-1 beta but not interleukin-18 even after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Epithelial cells play a critical role in periodontal disease through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). However, the role played by fibroblasts is still unclear. The rationale of this study was to throw light on the role of gingival fibroblasts in periodontal disease. We thus investigated the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-18, and ICE mRNA and the secretion of the corresponding proteins by human normal gingival fibroblasts before and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. IL-1 beta, IL-18, and ICE mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot and ELISA. We demonstrated that gingival fibroblasts expressed ICE mRNA. Basal expression of ICE was modulated following cell stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (5 mug/ml). However, gingival fibroblasts expressed low levels of IL-1 beta mRNA. The expression was potentiated by LPS. The expression of IL-1 beta mRNA was followed by the secretion of IL-1 beta but not IL-18 protein. Our study suggests that fibroblasts may be involved in the defense against infections via an IL-1 beta-mediated but not an IL-18-mediated mechanism.
TI  - Human dendritic cells respond to Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS by promoting a Th2  effector response in vitro.
AB  - Understanding how mucosal pathogens modulate the immune response may facilitate the development of vaccines for disparate human diseases. In the present study, human monocyte-derived DC (MDDC)were pulsed with LPS of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli 25922 and analyzed for: (i) production of Th-biasing/inflammatory cytokines; (ii) maturation/costimulatory molecules; and (iii) induction of allogeneic CD4+ and naive CD45RA+ T cell proliferation and release of Th1 or Th2 cytokines. We show that E. coli LPS-pulsed MDDC released Th1-biasing cytokines - consisting of high levels of IL-12 p70, IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) - but also TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-1beta. In contrast, no IL-12 p70 or IP-10, and lower levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10 were induced by P. gingivalis LPS. These differences were sustained at LPS doses that yielded nearly equivalent maturation of MDDC; moreover the T cell response was consistent: E. coli LPS-pulsed MDDC induced higher T cell proliferation, and T cells released more IFN-gamma and IL-2, but less IL-5 than T cells co-cultured with P. gingivalis LPS pulsed-MDDC. IL-13 was secreted by naive CD45RA+CD45RO-CD4+ T cells in response to P. gingivalisLPS-pulsed MDDC. These results suggest that human MDDC can be polarized by LPS from the mucosal pathogen P. gingivalis to induce a Th2 effector response in vitro.
TI  - Effectiveness of the quillaja saponin semi-synthetic analog GPI-0100 in potentiating mucosal and systemic responses to recombinant HagB from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, has been implicated in the etiology of adult periodontal disease. Among the potential virulence factors of this bacterium, the non-fimbrial adhesin hemagglutinin B (HagB) appears to be involved in the initial adherence of the bacteria to host tissue and the induction of anti-HagB antibody responses affords some protection from experimental alveolar bone loss. In the present study, we have investigated the ability of the quillaja saponin derivative GPI-0100 to act as an immunostimulant of responses to HagB following subcutaneous (s.c.) or intranasal (i.n.) immunization of mice. We have also compared the immunopotentiating ability of GPI-0100 with that of five other adjuvants. Evidence is provided that GPI-0100 was more effective than monophosphoryl lipid A and alum in inducing serum anti-HagB responses following s.c. immunization. A comparison of the responses induced following i.n. immunization with HagB and adjuvant revealed that the heat-labile toxin of Escherichia coli (LT) and the non-enzymatic mutant LT (E112K), followed by GPI-0100 potentiated higher serum and mucosal anti-HagB antibody responses, which in most cases were higher than those seen with the other adjuvants tested (i.e. monophosphoryl lipid A, alum and the B subunit of cholera toxin). Furthermore, a difference was seen in the nature of the serum IgG anti-HagB response based on the adjuvant used and route of immunization. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of GPI-0100 as both a systemic and mucosal adjuvant and support its potential use in the development of vaccines against periodontal, as well as other pathogens.
TI  - Kinetic and biochemical analysis of the mechanism of action of lysine 5,6-aminomutase.
AB  - Lysine 5,6-aminomutase (5,6-LAM) catalyzes the reversible and nearly isoenergetic transformations of D-lysine into 2,5-diaminohexanoate (2,5-DAH) and of L-beta-lysine into 3,5-diaminohexanoate (3,5-DAH). The activity of 5,6-LAM depends on pyridoxal-5(')-phosphate (PLP) and adenosylcobalamin. The currently postulated multistep mechanism involves at least 12 steps, two of which involve hydrogen transfer. The deuterium kinetic isotope effects on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) have been found to be 10.4+/-0.3 and 8.3+/-1.9, respectively, in the reaction of DL-lysine-3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-d(8). The corresponding isotope effects for reaction of DL-lysine-4,4,5,5-d(4) are 8.5+/-0.7 and 7.1+/-1.2, respectively. Neither cob(II)alamin nor a free radical can be detected in the steady state by UV-Vis spectrophotometry or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Therefore, hydrogen abstraction from carbon-5 of the substrate side chain is rate limiting in the mechanism. DL-4-Oxalysine is an alternative substrate for 5,6-LAM. DL-4-Oxalysine reacts irreversibly because the product breaks down into ammonia, acetaldehyde, and DL-serine. The value of K(m) for the reaction of DL-4-oxalysine is lower than that for DL-lysine and that of k(cat) for DL-4-oxalysine is slightly lower than that for DL-lysine. As measured by values of k(cat)/K(m), 5,6-LAM uses DL-4-oxalysine essentially as efficiently as the best substrates, D-lysine and L-beta-lysine, and more efficiently than DL-lysine. DL-4-Oxalysine induces the same suicide inactivation by electron transfer as do the biological substrates. The putative substrate-related radical intermediate is not sufficiently stabilized by the nonbonding 4-oxa electrons to be detectable by EPR spectroscopy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine using a contact test.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%). Bacterial samples (ATCC) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were submitted to a contact test. Solutions were evaluated at different time intervals: immediately, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after contact and repeated 10 times. The results of the contact test showed that 0.12% chlorhexidine did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval, while 0.5% and 1% chlorhexidine and 1% and 5% sodium hypochlorite did. These results permit us to conclude that to obtain better antimicrobial activity, chlorhexidine in a concentration greater than 0.12% should be used.
TI  - Pronounced conversion of the metal-specific activity of superoxide dismutase from Porphyromonas gingivalis by the mutation of a single amino acid (Gly155Thr) located apart from the active site.
AB  - Glycine 155, which is located approximately 10 A from the active metal sites, is  mostly conserved in aligned amino acid sequences of manganese-specific superoxide dismutases (Mn-SODs) and cambialistic SOD (showing the same activity with Fe and Mn) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, but is substituted for threonine in most Fe-SODs. Since Thr155 is located between Trp123 and Trp125, and Trp123 is one member of the metal-surrounding aromatic amino acids, there is a possibility that the conversion of this amino acid may cause a conversion of the metal-specific activity of cambialistic P. gingivalis SOD. To clarify this possibility, we have prepared a mutant of the P. gingivalis SOD with conversion of Gly155 to Thr. The ratios of the specific activities of Fe- to Mn-reconstituted enzyme, which are measured by the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c method, increased from 0.6 in the wild-type to 11.2 in the mutant SODs, indicating the conversion of the metal-specific activity of the enzyme from a cambialistic type to an Fe-specific type. The visible absorption spectra of the Fe- and Mn-reconstituted mutant SODs closely resembled those of Fe-specific SOD. Furthermore, the EPR spectra of the Fe- and Mn-reconstituted mutant SODs also closely resembled those of Fe-specific SOD. Three-dimensional structures of the Fe-reconstituted wild-type SOD and Mn-reconstituted mutant SOD have been determined at 1.6 A resolution. Both structures have identical conformations, orientations of residues involved in metal binding, and hydrogen bond networks, while the side chain of Trp123 is moved further toward the metal-binding site than in wild-type SOD. A possible contribution of the structural differences to the conversion of the metal-specific activity through rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network among Trp123, Gln70, Tyr35, and the metal-coordinated solvent is discussed.
TI  - An angiogenic switch in macrophages involving synergy between Toll-like receptors 2, 4, 7, and 9 and adenosine A(2A) receptors.
AB  - Adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) agonists synergize with Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS [toll-like receptor (TLR)4 agonist] to up-regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in murine macrophages. Here, we demonstrate that TLR2, TLR7, and TLR9, but not TLR3 and TLR5 agonists, also synergize with A(2A)R agonists and adenosine to up-regulate VEGF, while simultaneously strongly down-regulating TNFalpha expression. In the absence of adenosine or A(2A)R agonists, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) LPS and PAM(3)CAG (TLR2 agonists), resiquimod (R848) (TLR7 agonist), and non-methylated CpG DNA (TLR9 agonist) strongly up-regulate TNFalpha expression, with no effect on VEGF. In the presence of adenosine or A(2A)R agonists, but not A(1)R agonists, TLR2, 4, 7, and 9 agonists strongly up-regulate VEGF expression, while simultaneously down-regulating TNFalpha. C57BL/10ScN (TLR4 deletion mutant) macrophages produce TNFalpha in response to TLR2, 3, 7, and 9 agonists, but not the TLR4 agonist E. coli LPS. With adenosine or A(2A)R agonists, TLR2, 7, and 9, but not TLR4 agonists, also synergistically up-regulate VEGF, while down-regulating TNFalpha expression. Polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid (poly(I:C)) (TLR3 agonist) stimulates TNFalpha expression in macrophages from both C57BL/10ScSn and C57BL/10ScN mice, but has little effect on VEGF expression in the presence of adenosine or A(2A)R agonists. R-flagellins from Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) and Salmonella muenchen (S. muenchen) do not stimulate TNFalpha expression in either C57BL/10ScSn or C57BL10/ScN mice, and have no effect on VEGF production in the presence of adenosine or A(2A)R agonists. While adenosine and A(2A)R agonists strongly down-regulate TNFalpha protein expression induced by TLR2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 agonists, TNFalpha mRNA and NF-kappaB activation are not reduced. We propose a novel signaling pathway in murine macrophages involving synergy between TLRs 2, 4, 7, and 9 and A(2A)Rs, that up-regulates VEGF and down-regulates TNFalpha expression, thus acting as an angiogenic switch. This angiogenic switch may play an important role in ischemia when TLR agonists are present, providing an interface between innate immunity and wound healing.
TI  - Catecholamines and in vitro growth of pathogenic bacteria: enhancement of growth  varies greatly among bacterial species.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of catecholamines on in vitro growth of a range of bacterial species, including anaerobes. Bacteria tested included: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteriodes fragilis, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnie, Enterobacter Sp, and Salmonella choleraesuis. The results of the current study indicated that supplementation of bacterial cultures in minimal medium with norepinephrine or epinephrine did not result in increased growth of bacteria. Positive controls involving treatment of Escherichia coli with catecholamines did result in increased growth of that bacterial species. The results of the present study extend previous observations that showed differential capability of catecholamines to enhance bacterial growth in vitro.
TI  - Fluorescence lifetime measurements of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine in the presence of microbial cells.
AB  - The fluorescence lifetimes of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine (AlPcS2) in the presence of several different microbial cells are measured using the technique of time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) employing front-face illumination. The microbes studied are: Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Gram-negative bacteria), Streptococcus mutans (a Gram-positive bacterium), and the yeast Candida albicans. Complex fluorescence decays are observed when AlPcS2 is in the presence of these microbes; the fluorescence decay data can be fitted to a distribution of exponential lifetimes indicating that the AlPcS2 molecules experience a range of micro-environments The average fluorescence lifetimes of AlPcS2 in the presence of the microbes studied range from 4.85 to 5.95 ns, indicating differences in the cellular localisation of AlPcS2 with each of the microbes studied. These novel data are presented alongside a brief summary of existing AlPcS2 fluorescence lifetime data measured both in solution and in model biological systems.
TI  - Mechanism of quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several recently developed quinolones have excellent activity against a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and are thus potential drugs for the treatment of serious anaerobic and mixed infections. Resistance to quinolones is increasing worldwide, but is still relatively infrequent among anaerobes. Two main mechanisms, alteration of target enzymes (gyrase and topoisomerase IV) caused by chromosomal mutations in encoding genes, or reduced intracellular accumulation due to increased efflux of the drug, are associated with quinolone resistance. These mechanisms have also been found in anaerobic species. High-level resistance to the newer broad-spectrum quinolones often requires stepwise mutations in target genes. The increasing emergence of resistance among anaerobes may be a consequence of previous widespread use of quinolones, which may have enriched first-step mutants in the intestinal tract. Quinolone resistance in the Bacteroides fragilis group strains is strongly correlated with amino acid substitutions at positions 82 and 86 in GyrA (equivalent to positions 83 and 87 of Escherichia coli). Several studies have indicated that B. fragilis group strains possess efflux pump systems that actively expel quinolones, leading to resistance. DNA gyrase seems also to be the primary target for quinolones in Clostridium difficile, since amino acid substitutions in GyrA and GyrB have been detected in resistant strains. To what extent other mechanisms, such as mutational events in other target genes or alterations in outer-membrane proteins, contribute to resistance among anaerobes needs to be further investigated.
TI  - Comparison of ability of apoptosis induction by lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis with Escherichia coli.
AB  - We compared effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS with Escherichia coli LPS to  the murine peritoneal macrophage. E. coli LPS possessed a threshold dose between 100 micro g and 10 micro g, the higher dose induced apoptosis at the murine peritoneal macrophage while the lower dose did not. The ability of apoptosis induction at the murine peritoneal macrophage of P. gingivalis LPS was weaker than E. coli LPS. P. gingivalis LPS did not induce significant apoptosis in all tested dose. However, the morphology of the peritoneal macrophage treated by P. gingivalis LPS was obviously different from that of the unstimulated cells.
TI  - Monocytes heterozygous for the Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile mutations in the Toll-like receptor 4 gene show no deficit in lipopolysaccharide signalling.
AB  - Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is required for efficient recognition of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Two commonly occurring mutations in the human TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) have recently been shown to be associated with blunted physiological responses to inhaled LPS, and with increased risk of Gram-negative bacteraemia in sepsis patients and reduced risk of atherosclerosis in an Italian population. Here we show that monocytes from individuals heterozygous for both mutations in the TLR4 gene exhibit no deficit in recognition of LPS of Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Yersinia pestis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We propose that the relatively high frequency of these mutations in the Caucasian population may reflect modified responses of carriers to alternative TLR4 agonists.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic human B defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. Human B Defensin-2 (hBD-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. This peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Therefore, it is thought that hBD-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. However, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. The aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. The antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 was tested against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Escherichia coli. Antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were performed in vitro. The antibacterial activity of hBD-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. Furthermore, the activity of hBD-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. Our results suggest the possibility that synthetic hBD-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Chemical structure and immunobiological activity of lipid A from Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The novel chemical structure and immunobiological activities of Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 lipid A were investigated. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparation of P. intermedia was extracted using a phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether method, after which its purified lipid A was prepared by weak acid hydrolysis followed by chromatographic separations. The lipid A structure was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to be a diglucosamine backbone with a phosphate at the 4-position of the non-reducing side sugar, as well as five fatty acids containing branched long chains. It was similar to that of Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, except for the phosphorylation site. P. intermedia lipid A induced weaker cytokine production and NF-kappaB activation in murine cells via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 as compared to Escherichia coli synthetic lipid A (compound 506). Our results indicate that P. intermedia lipid A activates cells through a TLR4-dependent pathway similar to E. coli-type lipid A, even though these have structural differences.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing a HemK-family gene in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - HemK, a universally conserved protein of unknown function, has high amino acid similarity with DNA-(adenine-N6) methyltransferases (MTases). In the present study, we sequenced a 5026 bp DNA fragment just downstream of the PgPepO gene reported previously. The DNA sequence analysis revealed three ORFs. The ORF2 gene encoded a protein of 294 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 32,160 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF2 gene exhibited a significant similarity to sequence of HemK from E. coli (35% identical residues). The ORF2 gene complemented an E. coli hemK mutant. Thus, ORF2 was named PgHemK. From the point of veiw of our recent finding, that E. coli HemK catalyses the methylation of polypeptide chain release factors such as RF1 and RF2, we postulated that PgHemK might function as a protein MTase containing the DNA MTase motif.
TI  - The photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine in microbial systems.
AB  - Front-face illumination spectroscopic techniques were used to study photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine (AlPcS2) in the bacteria and yeast cells Escherichia coil, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Gram-negative bacteria), Streptococcus mutans (a Gram-positive bacterium), and the yeast Candida albicans. The photobleaching of AlPcS2 with the microbes studied is complex, involving reactive species generated by type I and type II processes with the rate dependent on the relative contributions of the different photobleaching mechanisms. The average rate of photobleaching of the AlPcS2 monomer in the presence of both E. coli and C. albicans increases as the fluence of the illumination source decreases. The effects of oxygen and sensitiser concentration on the rate of AlPcS2 photobleaching in these systems are also investigated.
TI  - Interactions of Porphyromonas gingivalis with host cells: implications for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological studies have suggested a contribution of periodontitis in atherosclerotic diseases. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such a connection involving general inflammatory responses and/or specific effects of periodontal bacteria on host tissues. METHODS: The role of the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis as a potential contributor to atherosclerosis has been investigated in model systems using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and murine J774 macrophage cell cultures. RESULTS: P. gingivalis 381 was demonstrated to induce foam cell formation in J774 macrophage cell cultures in the presence of low-density lipoproteins. The active bacterial component involved in this process appears to be lipopolysaccharide. This effect was not limited to these organisms as several other Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria exhibited the same property. In addition, in a more specific manner, P. gingivalis induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion in HUVEC cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The fimbriae of strain 381 are important, but are not required, for this inductive effect. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for P. gingivalis in several steps involved in atherosclerotic lesion formation.
TI  - [The neutralizing effect of histidine-rich-polypeptides on LPS from suspected periodontal pathogens].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human parotid histidine-rich-polypeptides (HRPs) are a family of lowmolecular-weight, cationic polypeptides. HRP-1, HRP-3 and HRP-5 comprise 85%-90% of the total HRPs and are called major HRPs. There were many researches indicating the antimicrobial activities of HRPs. Recently, HRPs were reported to have an inhibitory action on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of E. coli, with HRP-5 being the most effective one among the three major HRPs. Since the LPS of oral gram-negative bacteria is thought to be one of the important etiological factors during the development of periodontal diseases, our experiment was aimed to investigate the neutralizing effect of human parotid HRP-5 on the LPS of anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens, which have different chemical structures and biological activities compared with LPS of aerobic E. coli. METHODS: By using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE), HRP-5 was purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults. Two stains of suspected periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g, 47-A) and Fusobacterium nuceatum (F. n, separated from subgingival plaque of a patient with adult periodontitis) were mass cultured. After harvested in the midlogarithmic phase, they were washed and lyophilized. The LPS of dried bacteria were extracted by the modified Westphal hot phenol-water procedures and purified by the enzyme digestion plus ultracentrifugation. Limulus test was applied to test the neutralizing effect of HRP-5 on the LPS-induced gelation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate. In brief, the standard LPS of E. coli, or extracted LPS of P. g or F. n, was preincubated with HRP-5 in a tube separately in room temperature for 10 minutes. Then the reagent of Limulus amoebocyte lysate was added in all the tubes, continued the incubation in 37 degrees C for one hour. After that, the gelation level of every tube was observed. RESULTS: LPS extracted from P. g and F. n both showed good purity and strong activities to induce gelation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate. The gelation induced by LPS (1 ng/ml) of these two anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens were weakly inhibited by HRP-5 (10 micrograms/ml), similar to that observed with standard LPS of E. coli. To get a complete neutralizing effect on LPS, it may be important to increase the concentration of HRP-5. CONCLUSION: It appeared that HRPs could neutralize the endotoxic properties of LPS of suspected periodontal pathogens, therefore may contribute to periodontal health. The present investigation further confirmed that HRPs are important components of the host non-immune defense system.
TI  - Induction of in vitro reprogramming by Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 agonists in murine macrophages: effects of TLR "homotolerance" versus "heterotolerance" on NF-kappa B signaling pathway components.
AB  - In this study, tolerance induction by preexposure of murine macrophages to Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 agonists was revisited, focusing on the major signaling components associated with NF-kappaB activation. Pretreatment of macrophages with a pure TLR4 agonist (protein-free Escherichia coli (Ec) LPS) or with TLR2 agonists (Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS or synthetic lipoprotein Pam3Cys) led to suppression of TNF-alpha secretion, IL-1R-associated kinase-1, and IkappaB kinase (IKK) kinase activities, c-jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, and to suppression of NF-kappaB DNA binding and transactivation upon challenge with the same agonist (TLR4 or TLR2 "homotolerance," respectively). Despite inhibited NF-kappaB DNA binding, increased levels of nuclear NF-kappaB were detected in agonist-pretreated macrophages. For all the intermediate signaling elements, heterotolerance was weaker than TLR4 or TLR2 homotolerance with the exception of IKK kinase activity. IKK kinase activity was unperturbed in heterotolerance. TNF-alpha secretion was also suppressed in P. gingivalis LPS-pretreated, Ec LPS-challenged cells, but not vice versa, while Pam3Cys and Ec LPS did not induce a state of cross-tolerance at the level of TNF-alpha. Experiments designed to elucidate novel mechanisms of NF-kappaB inhibition in tolerized cells revealed the potential contribution of IkappaBepsilon and IkappaBxi inhibitory proteins and the necessity of TLR4 engagement for induction of tolerance to Toll receptor-IL-1R domain-containing adapter protein/MyD88-adapter-like-dependent gene expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate that induction of homotolerance affects a broader spectrum of signaling components than in heterotolerance, with selective modulation of specific elements within the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
TI  - Role for recombinant gamma-glutamyltransferase from Treponema denticola in glutathione metabolism.
AB  - Volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), have been implicated in the development of periodontal disease. Glutathione is an important thiol source for H(2)S production in periodontal pockets. Our recent studies have delineated a pathway of glutathione metabolism in Treponema denticola that releases H(2)S. In this pathway, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of glutathione degradation. We have cloned the gene of GGT from T. denticola, which contains an open reading frame of 726 bp encoding a protein of 241 amino acids. Transformation of this gene into Escherichia coli led to the expression of a recombinant protein. After purification by chromatography, the recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity typical of GGT, catalyzing the degradation of Na-gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline (GNA) and the hydrolysis of glutathione, releasing glutamic acid or glutamine and cysteinylglycine. L-Cysteine is not a substrate of GGT. Importantly, GNA, when added to T. denticola, was able to compete with glutathione and inhibit the production of H(2)S, ammonia, and pyruvate. This was accompanied by the suppression of hemoxidative and hemolytic activities of the bacteria. Purified GGT was inactivated by TLCK (Nalpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and proteinase K treatment. However, higher enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. Our further experiments showed that the addition of recombinant GGT to Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium without significant glutathione-metabolizing capacity, drastically increased the utilization of glutathione by the bacterium, producing H(2)S, ammonia, and pyruvate. This was again accompanied by enhanced bacterial hemoxidative and hemolytic activities. Together, the results suggest an important role for GGT in glutathione metabolism in oral bacteria.
TI  - Counteracting interactions between lipopolysaccharide molecules with differential activation of toll-like receptors.
AB  - We investigated counteracting interactions between the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)  from Escherichia coli (Ec-LPS) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg-LPS), which induce cellular activation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2, respectively. We found that Ec-LPS induced tolerance in THP-1 cells to subsequent tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) induction by Pg-LPS, though the reverse was not true, and looked for explanatory differential effects on the signal transduction pathway. Cells exposed to Pg-LPS, but not to Ec-LPS, displayed persisting expression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase without apparent degradation, presumably allowing prolonged relay of downstream signals. Accordingly, cells pretreated with Pg-LPS, but not with Ec-LPS, were effectively activated in response to subsequent exposure to either LPS molecule, as evidenced by assessing nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity. In fact, Pg-LPS primed THP-1 cells for enhanced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha release upon restimulation with the same LPS. This was a dose-dependent effect and correlated with upregulation of surface TLR2 expression. Furthermore, we observed inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in a reporter cell line pretreated with Ec-LPS and restimulated with Pg-LPS (compared to cells pretreated with medium only and restimulated with Pg-LPS), but not when the reverse treatment was made. Although Pg-LPS could not make cells tolerant to subsequent activation by Ec-LPS, Pg-LPS inhibited Ec-LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 release when the two molecules were added simultaneously into THP-1 cell cultures. Pg-LPS also suppressed P. gingivalis FimA protein-induced NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in the 3E10/huTLR4 reporter cell line, which does not express TLR2. This rules out competition for common signaling intermediates, suggesting that Pg-LPS may block component(s) of the TLR4 receptor complex. Interactions between TLR2 and TLR4 agonists may be important in the regulation of inflammatory reactions.
TI  - Induction of keratinocyte growth factor 1 Expression by lipopolysaccharide is regulated by CD-14 and toll-like receptors 2 and 4.
AB  - Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that is associated with increased concentrations of gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and epithelial cell proliferation. Regulation of this proliferation is poorly understood but is most likely controlled by locally expressed growth factors. Keratinocyte growth factor 1, an epithelium-specific growth factor, is expressed by gingival fibroblasts, and its expression is regulated in a concentration-dependent manner by lipopolysaccharide. In this study, induction of keratinocyte growth factor 1 protein expression was dependent on gingival fibroblast expression of membrane CD14 (mCD14) and Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis induced membrane expression of CD14 at 1, 3, and 24 h. Specifically, lipopolysaccharide induced low mCD14 expression gingival fibroblasts to express mCD14 at a level consistent with that of high mCD14 expression cells. Functional studies with specific blocking antibodies for CD14 and Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 implicated all of these molecules in signal transduction. The rapid decrease in cell membrane expression of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 after treatment with lipopolysaccharide was consistent with receptor internalization, and blocking of either of these receptors completely inhibited keratinocyte growth factor 1 protein expression. The transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB were involved in lipopolysaccharide induction of keratinocyte growth factor 1 mRNA and protein expression. These results suggest that lipopolysaccharide may induce proliferation of periodontal epithelial cells by upregulating keratinocyte growth factor 1 expression via the CD14 and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.
TI  - Effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis on the activation of mouse macrophages by lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) is a micro-organism that is suggested to play an etiologic role in acute and chronic periodontitis. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the question whether PG is capable of inducing interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production in macrophages. Furthermore, the effect of PG on the activation of macrophages by Escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was studied. The cytokines were analyzed by detection of specific mRNA. The mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR and semi-quantitatively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and densitometrically, respectively. These studies demonstrate that LPS was more active than PG in inducing mRNA expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, MIP-2 and GM-CSF. Moreover, PG reduced the mRNA expression of the macrophages stimulated with LPS, especially the IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA expression was decreased.
TI  - CD14-mediated induction of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by a heat-resistant constituent of Porphyromonas gingivalis in endothelial cells.
AB  - Viable and inactivated Porphyromonas gingivalis dose-dependently induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The inactivated P. gingivalis, in comparison with viable bacteria, tended to enhance the production of both chemokines more strongly. The production of MCP-1 protein began increasing immediately after stimulation by P. gingivalis, and there was a nearly linear increase from 0 to 8 h of incubation, whereas IL-8 production showed a linear increase between 4 and 12 h of incubation. The IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA expressions in HUVECs as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or Quantikine mRNA colorimetric quantification kits were found to be enhanced by P. gingivalis. Furthermore, the time courses of IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA expressions were in accordance with those of protein production. Addition of polymyxin B or boiling did not weaken the stimulatory effect of P. gingivalis, which inhibited the effect of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (E. coli LPS) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), respectively. In contrast, the induction of IL-8 and MCP-1 by P. gingivalis was significantly reduced by anti-CD14 antibody. Our results suggest that some heat-stable component of P. gingivalis, including LPS, may be responsible for the induction of IL-8 and MCP-1 in HUVECs by a CD14-dependent mechanism. These effects might be involved in the accumulation and activation of neutrophils and monocytes at an early stage of the periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Activation of the proton transfer pathway in catalysis by iron superoxide dismutase.
AB  - Catalysis by Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis iron superoxide dismutase was activated by addition of primary amines, as measured by pulse radiolysis and stopped-flow spectrophotometry. This activation was saturable for most amines investigated, and a free energy plot of the apparent second-order rate constant of activation was linear as a function of the pK(a) of the amine, indicating activation by proton transfer. Amines provide an alternate rather than the only pathway for proton transfer, and catalysis was appreciable in the absence of amines. Solvent hydrogen isotope effects were near unity for amine activation, which is consistent with rate-contributing proton transfer if the pK(a) of the proton acceptor on the enzyme is not in the region of the pK(a) values of the amines studied, from 7.8 to 10.6. The activation of catalysis by these amines was uncompetitive with respect to superoxide, interpreted as proton transfer in a ternary complex of amine with the enzyme-bound peroxide dianion.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Porphyromonas gingivalis gene for protoporphyrinogen  oxidase by complementation of a hemG mutant of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in periodontal pathogenesis, has a growth requirement for iron protoporphyrin IX. By complementation with a P. gingivalis 381 chromosomal DNA library, we were able to isolate a clone that enhanced the poor growth of a hemG mutant of Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence analysis of this clone revealed three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF3 encoded a protein of 466 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 51 695 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF3 gene had significant similarity to sequences of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) from Myxococcus xanthus (30% identical residues). When the ORF3 gene was overexpressed in E. coli, the extract had much higher PPO activity than a control extract, and this activity was inhibited by acifluorfen, a specific inhibitor of PPO. Thus, ORF3 was named PgHemG. Furthermore, several porphyrin-related genes, including hemD, hemN and hemH, were identified in the data bases on the websites available on-line. We postulated that a porphyrin biosynthetic pathway to heme from preuroporphyrin may be conserved in P. gingivalis.
TI  - A resistance-nodulation-cell division family xenobiotic efflux pump in an obligate anaerobe, Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative obligate anaerobe, contains two homologs of an Escherichia coli resistance-nodulation-cell division-type multidrug exporter gene, acrB, in putative operons, together with homologs of membrane fusion protein gene acrA and outer membrane channel gene tolC. MIC determination and accumulation assays with mutants with disruptions of one or more genes showed that one cluster, named xepCAB, pumped out multiple agents including rifampin, puromycin, and ethidium bromide.
TI  - A conserved Ala320 in the FtsZ of Porphyromonas gingivalis is important for cell  division.
AB  - We have previously cloned the gene encoding the cell division protein FtsZ, designated PgFtsZ, from Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral anaerobic bacterium implicated in advanced periodontal disease. In the present study, we have shown that overexpression of ZDeltaC02, a mutant form of PgFtsZ in which 128 amino acid residues have been removed from the C-terminus, caused an inhibition of cell division in E. coli cells. However, overexpression of ZDeltaC03, missing 177 residues from the C-terminus, did not inhibit cell division, suggesting that the 49 residues between 281 and 329 are required for cell division. Sequence comparison of the known prokaryotic FtsZs revealed that this region contained a highly conserved domain, designated A-domain, in which Ala320 of PgFtsZ was conserved throughout a broad variety of species. Therefore, we analyzed the role of Ala320 by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that overexpression of ZA320H and ZA320R resulted in the normal phenotype, unlike the wild type. Immunoblot analysis showed that these mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels. These results suggest that Ala320 is highly conserved and is crucial for cell division.
TI  - 3-Chloro-DL-alanine resistance by L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  - The antibacterial agent 3-chloro-DL-alanine (3CA) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mM 3CA, whereas Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. We isolated the 3CA resistance gene from F. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of L-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. The enzyme also exhibits 3CA chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. This antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
TI  - Recognition of the carbohydrate modifications to the RgpA protease of Porphyromonas gingivalis by periodontal patient serum IgG.
AB  - Periodontal infections by Porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with a sustained systemic IgG antibody response and elevations in local antibody synthesis to this organism. One of the targets of this response is a protease, RgpAcat, which is an important virulence determinant of this organism. Recently, we demonstrated that this molecule is glycosylated and that the glycan chains are immunologically related to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Curtis et al., Infect Immun 1999;62:3816-3823). In the present study, we examined the role of these glycan additions in the immune recognition of RgpAcat, by sera from adult periodontal patients (n = 25). Serum IgG antibody levels to P. gingivalis W50, RgpAcat and LPS and to recombinant RgpA were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). No correlation was observed between the antibody levels to RgpAcat from P. gingivalis and the recombinant form of this enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli. However, a strong association was found between the recognition of LPS and the wild-type enzyme (R = 0.8926; p = 0.0005). Incorporation of LPS into the ELISA led to a significant reduction (mean 25%; range 0.8-43%, SD = 15; p < 0.05) in the recognition of RgpAcat, but had no effect on the recognition of control antigens. Deglycosylation of RgpAcat led to the abolition of immune recognition by patient serum IgG, which suggests that the glycan additions to this molecule are the principal targets of the immune response. Therefore, glycosylation of the RgpAcat protease may play an important role in immune evasion by shielding the primary structure from immune recognition.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a haemagglutinin of Haemophilus paragallinarum.
AB  - The gene encoding a haemagglutinin of H. paragallinarum, hagA, has been identified and the full-length nucleotide sequence determined. A approximately 39 kDa protein, recognized by an anti-haemagglutinin monoclonal antibody, mAb4D, was purified from H. paragallinarum strain 0083 and the N-terminal sequence obtained. The full-length nucleotide sequence was obtained by inverse PCR and the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded was shown to be similar to other outer-membrane proteins of closely related organisms in the HAP group (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Pasteurella), especially the P5 protein of Haemophilus influenzae. The hagA gene was cloned into a His-tag expression vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain M15(pREP4). The identity of the purified recombinant protein as a H. paragallinarum haemagglutinin was confirmed by haemagglutination of chicken red blood cells and reactivity, in a Western blot, with the monoclonal antibody specific for the serovar A haemagglutinin.
TI  - Identification of a novel pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding site in adenosylcobalamin-dependent lysine 5,6-aminomutase from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Lysine 5,6-aminomutase (5,6-LAM) catalyzes the interconversion of D-lysine with 2,5-diaminohexanoate and of L-beta-lysine with 3,5-diaminohexanoate. The coenzymes for 5,6-LAM are adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). In the proposed chemical mechanism, AdoCbl initiates the formation of substrate radicals, and PLP facilitates the radical rearrangement by forming an external aldimine linkage with the epsilon-amino group of a substrate, either D-lysine or L-beta-lysine. In the resting enzyme, an internal aldimine between PLP and an essential lysine in the active site facilitates productive PLP binding and catalysis. We present here biochemical, biophysical, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, which document the existence of an essential lysine residue in the active site of 5,6-LAM from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Reduction of 5,6-LAM with NaBH(4) rapidly inactivates the enzyme and shifts the electronic absorption band from 420 to 325 nm. This is characteristic of the reduction of an aldimine linkage between the carbonyl group of PLP and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue. The reduced peptide was identified by Q-TOF/MS and further confirmed by Q-TOF/MS/MS sequencing. We show that lysine 144 in the small subunit of 5,6-LAM is the essential lysine residue. Lysine 144(beta) is separated by only 11 amino acids from histidine 133(beta), which forms a part of the "base-off"-AdoCbl binding motif. The sequence of the novel PLP-binding motif is conserved in 5,6-LAM from Clostridium sticklandii and P. gingivalis, and it is distinct from all known PLP-binding motifs. Mutation of lysine 144(beta) to glutamine led to K144Q(beta)-5,6-LAM, which displayed no enzymatic activity and no absorption band corresponding to an internal PLP-aldamine. In summary, we introduce a novel PLP-binding motif, the first to be discovered in an AdoCbl-dependent enzyme.
TI  - Invasion of vascular cells in vitro by Porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  - AIM: The objective of this study was to determine whether laboratory strains and  clinical isolates of microorganisms associated with root canal infections can invade primary cultures of cardiovascular cells. METHODOLOGY: Quantitative levels of bacterial invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) were measured using a standard antibiotic protection assay. Transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm and visualize internalization within the vascular cells. RESULTS: Of the laboratory and clinical strains tested, only P. endodontalis ATCC 35406 was invasive in an antibiotic protection assay using HCAEC and CASMC. Invasion of P. endodontalis ATCC 35406 was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. DISCUSSION: Certain microorganisms associated with endodontic infections are invasive. If bacterial invasion of the vasculature contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, then microorganisms in the pulp chamber represent potential pathogens.
TI  - Characterization and expression of a novel Porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane protein, Omp28.
AB  - We report the characterization of a Porphyromonas gingivalis gene, designated omp28, encoding a protein that we have previously purified and characterized as a 28-kDa outer membrane protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of the omp28 open reading frame displayed an outer membrane leader sequence and lipoprotein attachment site but did not exhibit any significant overall sequence identity with protein sequences in the databases. A small stretch of amino acids (19 residues) exhibits 50% sequence identity with a segment of a fimbrial protein from Dichelobacter nodosus involved in adhesion, suggesting that Omp28 may be a surface adhesin/receptor of P. gingivalis. Using the pET-24 vector we expressed recombinant Omp28 (rOmp28) in Escherichia coli. Western blot analyses of purified rOmp28 with rabbit antisera to a P. gingivalis outer membrane preparation, protective rat anti-whole P. gingivalis antisera and pooled human sera from chronic periodontitis patients showed that the recombinant was recognized by all antisera. Further, anti-rOmp28 antisera exhibited strong reactivity with a panel of four laboratory strains and 10 clinical isolates of P. gingivalis from the United States, Sudan, Romania and Norway. These results suggest that Omp28 is expressed by a wide distribution of P. gingivalis strains.
TI  - Separation of the outer membrane and identification of major outer membrane proteins from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The outer membrane of Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral strict anaerobe, was isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The outer membrane obtained by the differential detergent extraction method, previously reported, showed an essentially similar protein pattern on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), confirming that the latter method is suitable for the study of outer membrane proteins in this organism. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that major outer membrane proteins in this organism included Arg-gingipain, Lys-gingipain, RagA (a TonB-linked receptor), and putative porins that were homologous to Escherichia coli OmpA.
TI  - Bacteria induce osteoclastogenesis via an osteoblast-independent pathway.
AB  - Bacteria or their products may cause chronic inflammation and subsequent bone loss. This inflammation and bone loss may be associated with significant morbidity in chronic otitis media, periodontitis, endodontic lesions, and loosening of orthopedic implants caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-contaminated implant particles. Currently, it is not clear how bacteria or endotoxin-induced bone resorption occurs and what cell types are involved. Here we report that Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, and Escherichia coli LPS induce osteoclastic cell formation from murine leukocytes in the absence of osteoblasts. In contrast, stimulation with parathyroid hormone had no effect. These multinucleated, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells were positive for receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK), the receptor for osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL), also known as RANK ligand (RANKL). Blocking antibodies demonstrated that their formation was dependent upon expression of OPGL and, to a lesser extent, on tumor necrosis factor alpha. Mononuclear cells represented a significant source of OPGL production. In vivo, P. gingivalis injection stimulated OPGL expression in both mononuclear leukocytes and osteoblastic cells. Thus, these findings describe a pathway by which bacteria could enhance osteolysis independently of osteoblasts and suggest that the mix of cells that participate in inflammatory and physiologic bone resorption may be different. This may give insight into new targets of therapeutic intervention.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of Brazilian subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. The present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis Brazilians using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. METHODS: Twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [PD], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [AL], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean PD, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean AL, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. Measurements of PD, AL, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. The presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard method. RESULTS: Periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (E. faecalis, E. coli and Bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (P < 0.05). Most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, E. nodatum, and F. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean PD and AL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota of Brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.
TI  - A naturally occurring NAR variable domain binds the Kgp protease from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The new antigen receptor (NAR) from sharks consists of a single immunoglobulin variable domain attached to five constant domains, and is hypothesised to function as an antibody. Two closely related NARs with affinity for the Kgp (lysine-specific) gingipain protease from Porphyromonas gingivalis were selected by panning an NAR variable domain library. When produced in Escherichia coli, these recombinant NARs were stable, correctly folded, and specifically bound Kgp (K(d)=1.31+/-0.26x10(-7) M). Binding localised to the Kgp adhesin domains, however without inhibiting adhesin activity. These naturally occurring proteins indicate an immune response to pathogenic bacteria and suggest that the NAR is a true antibody-like molecule.
TI  - LuxS: its role in central metabolism and the in vitro synthesis of 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone.
AB  - Many bacteria produce extracellular molecules which function in cell-to-cell communication. One of these molecules, autoinducer 2 (AI-2), was first described as an extracellular signal produced by Vibrio harveyi to control luciferase expression. Subsequently, a number of bacteria have been shown to possess AI-2 activity in their culture supernatants, and bear the luxS gene product, which is required for AI-2 synthesis. In Porphyromonas gingivalis, luxS and pfs, encoding a 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTA/SAH'ase), form an operon, suggesting that S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) serves as a substrate for AI-2 production. Cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli MG1655, but not DH5alpha (which carries a luxS frame-shift mutation) were capable of generating AI-2 activity upon addition of SAH, but not MTA. S-Ribosyl-homocysteine (RH) derived from SAH also served as a substrate in E. coli MG1655 extracts. RH-supplemented cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that lacks luxS, only generated AI-2 activity following the introduction of a plasmid containing the Por. gingivalis pfs-luxS operon. In addition, defined in vitro systems consisting of the purified LuxS proteins from Por. gingivalis, E. coli, Neisseria meningitidis or Staphylococcus aureus converted RH to homocysteine and a compound that exhibits AI-2 activity.4-Hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone was identified by mass spectrometry analysis as a major product formed in this in vitro reaction. In E. coli MG1655, expression of T3SH [the bacteriophage T3 S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) hydrolase] significantly reduced AI-2 activity in culture supernatants, suggesting that AI-2 production is limited by the amount of SAH produced in SAM-dependent transmethylase reactions. The authors suggest that the LuxS protein has an important metabolic function in the recycling of SAH. They also show that Ps. aeruginosa is capable of removing AI-2 activity, implying that this molecule may act as a nutrient. In many bacteria AI-2 may in fact represent not a signal molecule but a metabolite which is released early and metabolized in the later stages of growth.
TI  - Characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis FtsZ containing a novel GTPase activity.
AB  - The FtsZ protein is a GTPase that is essential for cell division. We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed the FtsZ (PgFtsZ) gene from the Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium implicated in progressive periodontal disease. The PgFtsZ gene consisted of 1374 bp and coded for an acidic protein with a calculated molecular mass of 50,253 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a significant homology with E. coli FtsZ (54% identical residues). Like other prokaryotic FtsZs, PgFtsZ possessed the clear motifs for GTP binding (GGGTGTG) and hydrolysis (NLDFADV). When PgFtsZ was overexpressed in E. coli, cell division was inhibited. Recombinant PgFtsZ was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The purified PgFtsZ exhibited GTPase activity even in the absence of Mg2+, and completely retained its activity with EDTA. Furthermore, Na+ and K+ ions inhibited its GTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that PgFtsZ contains an atypical GTPase activity that has not been previously described.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the superoxide dismutase gene of the feline strain of Porphyromonas gingivalis: immunological recognition of the protein by cats with periodontal disease.
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that feline members of the genus Porphyromonas are of consequence in periodontal disease in cats. Several possible virulence factors from feline strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis have been described that have similarities to those of human P. gingivalis. Both human and feline strains of P. gingivalis produce superoxide dismutase (SOD) which has been proposed as modulator of the inflammatory response during infection. The objective of this study was to clone the superoxide dismutase gene of feline P. gingivalis, to compare the characteristics of its product with that of the native enzyme and to determine its immunoreactivity in cats with periodontal disease. The sod gene of the feline strain Veterinary Pathology and Bacteriology (VPB) 3457 of P. gingivalis was amplified by PCR and cloned in frame with the alpha-peptide of the LacZ gene of E. coli in plasmid pUC19. This construct expressed SOD activity in E. coli with characteristics similar to those of the native SOD enzyme of P. gingivalis human strain 381 and the parent feline strain VPB 3457. The recombinant SOD had an apparent molecular weight of 54,700+/-1300 (S.E.M.) and was inactivated by 5mM hydrogen peroxide but not by 2mM KCN. There was a significant association (P=0.005) between the immunoreactivity of cats to P. gingivalis VPB 3457 soluble whole cell proteins on immunoblots and their responsiveness to the SOD protein. This suggests that cats showing a marked serum responsiveness to P. gingivalis itself, react to the SOD enzyme and further supports the role of feline P. gingivalis in periodontal disease.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide is both agonist and antagonist for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key inflammatory mediator. It has been proposed to  function as an important molecule that alerts the host of potential bacterial infection. Although highly conserved, LPS contains important structural differences among different bacterial species that can significantly alter host responses. For example, LPS obtained from Porphyromonas gingivalis, an etiologic agent for periodontitis, evokes a highly unusual host cell response. Human monocytes respond to this LPS by the secretion of a variety of different inflammatory mediators, while endothelial cells do not. In addition, P. gingivalis LPS inhibits endothelial cell expression of E-selectin and interleukin 8 (IL-8) induced by other bacteria. In this report the ability of P. gingivalis LPS to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was investigated. It was found that p38 MAP kinase activation occurred in response to P. gingivalis LPS in human monocytes. In contrast, no p38 MAP kinase activation was observed in response to P. gingivalis LPS in human endothelial cells or CHO cells transfected with human Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). In addition, P. gingivalis LPS was an effective inhibitor of Escherichia coli-induced p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in both endothelial cells and CHO cells transfected with human TLR-4. These data demonstrate that P. gingivalis LPS activates the LPS-associated p38 MAP kinase in monocytes and that it can be an antagonist for E. coli LPS activation of p38 MAP kinase in endothelial and CHO cells. These data also suggest that although LPS is generally considered a bacterial component that alerts the host to infection, LPS from P. gingivalis may selectively modify the host response as a means to facilitate colonization.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - We have previously cloned the gene encoding a pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK), designated PgPFK, from Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral anaerobic bacterium implicated in advanced periodontal disease. In this study, recombinant PgPFK was purified to homogeneity, and biochemically characterized. The apparent K(m) value for fructose 6-phosphate was 2.2 mM, which was approximately 20 times higher than that for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The value was significantly greater than any other described PFKs, except for Amycolatopsis methanolica PFK which is proposed to function as a fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase (FBPase). The PgPFK appears to serves as FBPase in this organism. We postulate that this may lead to the gluconeogenic pathways to synthesize the lipopolysaccharides and/or glycoconjugates essential for cell viability.
TI  - LuxS-dependent quorum sensing in Porphyromonas gingivalis modulates protease and  haemagglutinin activities but is not essential for virulence.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative black-pigmented obligate anaerobe implicated in the aetiology of human periodontal disease. The virulence of P. gingivalis is associated with the elaboration of the cysteine proteases Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp), which are produced at high bacterial cell densities. To determine whether quorum sensing plays a role in the regulation of Rgp and Kgp, biosensors capable of detecting either N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHLs) or the luxS-dependent autoinducer (AI-2) quorum-sensing signalling molecules in spent culture supernatants were first employed. While no AHLs could be detected, the Vibrio harveyi BB170 biosensor was activated by spent P. gingivalis W50 culture supernatants. The P. gingivalis luxS gene was cloned and demonstrated to restore AI-2 production in the Escherichia coli luxS mutant DH5alpha. Mutation of luxS abolished AI-2 production in P. gingivalis. Western blotting using antibodies raised against the recombinant protein revealed that LuxS levels increased throughout growth even though AI-2 activity was only maximally detected at the mid-exponential phase of growth and disappeared by the onset of stationary phase. Similar results were obtained with E. coli DH5alpha transformed with luxS, suggesting that AI-2 production is not limited by a lack of LuxS protein. Analysis of Rgp and Kgp protease activities revealed that the P. gingivalis luxS mutant produced around 45% less Rgp and 30% less Kgp activity than the parent strain. In addition, the luxS mutant exhibited a fourfold reduction in haemagglutinin titre. However, these reductions in virulence determinant levels were insufficient to attenuate the luxS mutant in a murine lesion model of P. gingivalis infection.
TI  - Does the shape of lipid A determine the interaction of LPS with Toll-like receptors?
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers the activation of the immune system through the induction of cytokine release. Although it was assumed initially that LPS molecules from different bacteria are similar, recent evidence suggests that structural and functional differences between LPS species are the rule rather than the exception. It has been proposed that the shape of the lipid A component determines the bioactivity of LPS, with lipid A that adopts a conical conformation being more active than lipid A that adopts a cylindrical shape. The mechanism linking the molecular conformation with the biological activity of LPS has not been elucidated. We propose that LPS with a conical shape (e.g. from Escherichia coli) induces cytokine production through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), whereas more cylindrical LPS (e.g. from Porphyromonas gingivalis) induces expression of a different set of cytokines through TLR2. Strictly cylindrical LPS molecules (e.g. the lipid A precursor Ia or from Rhodobacter sphaeroides) have antagonistic properties at the level of TLRs.
TI  - Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)-1 and -2 protein and gene expression in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - The onset and progression of periodontal disease is associated with significant changes in the epithelial component of the attachment complex. From the early to the advanced stages of periodontal disease increased epithelial cell proliferation, migration and invasion into the surrounding connective tissue takes place. Concomitantly there is a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine expression in periodontal tissue and quantitative and qualitative changes in the subgingival microflora, including an increase in gram-negative microorganisms. One of the most significant virulence factors of these bacteria is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) connected to the outer membrane. Two important growth factors controlling epithelial behavior are Keratinocyte Growth Factor-1 (KGF-1) and -2 (KGF-2). Connective tissue cells express these growth factors, but only epithelial cells respond to them. We studied the effect of proinflammatory cytokines and LPS on gingival fibroblast expression of KGF-1 and KGF-2 in vitro. Gingival fibroblasts were found to express KGF-1 and -2 in culture but only KGF-1 protein and gene expression was stimulated by serum, in a concentration-dependent manner by proinflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 and LPS isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. The local increase in proinflammatory cytokine expression and the accumulation of LPS in disease sites may therefore stimulate gingival fibroblast expression of KGF-1. We hypothesize that this local increase in KGF-1 expression may, via a paracrine mechanism, stimulate local epithelial cell proliferation, migration and invasion during the onset and progression of periodontitis.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial RNase P by aminoglycoside-arginine conjugates.
AB  - The potential of RNAs and RNA-protein (RNP) complexes as drug targets is currently being explored in various investigations. For example, a hexa-arginine derivative of neomycin (NeoR) and a tri-arginine derivative of gentamicin (R3G) were recently shown to disrupt essential RNP interactions between the trans-activator protein (Tat) and the Tat-responsive RNA (trans-activating region) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and also inhibit HIV replication in cell culture. Based on certain structural similarities, we postulated that NeoR and R3G might also be effective in disrupting RNP interactions and thereby inhibiting bacterial RNase P, an essential RNP complex involved in tRNA maturation. Our results indicate that indeed both NeoR and R3G inhibit RNase P activity from evolutionarily divergent pathogenic bacteria and do so more effectively than they inhibit partially purified human RNase P activity.
TI  - Activation of human gingival epithelial cells by cell-surface components of black-pigmented bacteria: augmentation of production of interleukin-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1.
AB  - Black-pigmented anaerobic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, are amongst the predominant bacteria in periodontal pockets and have been implicated in periodontal diseases. To elucidate the roles of gingival keratinocytes, which are the first cells encountered by oral bacteria in periodontal diseases, human gingival keratinocytes in primary culture were stimulated with cell-surface components of P gingivalis and Pr. intermedia. A glycoprotein fraction from Pr. intermedia (PGP) clearly augmented the release of interleukin-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This PGP also induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), as determined by flow cytometry. The augmentation of mRNA expression for these molecules was also confirmed by reverse transcription PCR. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pr. intermedia and Escherichia coli was completely inactive in these assays. LPS fraction and purified fimbriae from P gingivalis exhibited weak activities. Cytokine production and ICAM-1 expression by gingival keratinocytes might cause accumulation and activation of neutrophils in the epithelium and, therefore, may be involved in the initiation and development of inflammation in periodontal tissues.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - Cross-reaction between the genus-specific lipopolysaccharide antigen of Chlamydia spp. and the lipopolysaccharides of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Escherichia coli O119 and Salmonella newington: implications for diagnosis.
AB  - Seven hybridoma clones, secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the genus-specific chlamydial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen were obtained after immunization of BALB/c mice with formalin killed Chlamydia psittaci. The antigen-binding properties of the MAbs were characterized in different immunologic reactions with purified chlamydial elementary bodies and LPS antigens from S- and R-forms of Gram-negative bacteria. Four MAbs reacted with the heterologous LPS antigens of Salmonella R-mutants, Escherichia coli Re chemotype and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Two MAbs demonstrated in addition a significant reactivity with Porphyromonas gingivalis, E. coli O119 and Salmonella newington LPS in ELISA, dot-ELISA and passive hemolysis assay (for clone 204G9). One MAb cross-reacted only with Salmonella minnesota Re LPS in ELISA. In indirect immunofluorescent assay six MAbs produced bright green fluorescence with all tested chlamydial strains and five of them reacted with the Re and Rb2 chemotypes of S. minnesota. The results demonstrate a wide cross-reactivity of the produced MAbs with LPS antigens of various Gram-negative bacteria, posing the question for careful consideration and interpretation of serology results for Chlamydia spp.
TI  - Role for fimbriae and lysine-specific cysteine proteinase gingipain K in expression of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein in Porphyromonas gingivalis-infected endothelial cells.
AB  - Recent cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological studies have demonstrated  an association between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis and human coronary heart disease. Previously, we have established that the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of invading aortic, heart, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Since atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response initiated at the vascular wall, interactions of P. gingivalis with endothelial cells and the subsequent host cell response to infection may be important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this study we examined the consequences of P. gingivalis infection of HUVEC on the expression of the chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). HUVEC were found to constitutively produce low levels of IL-8 and MCP-1. The addition of P. gingivalis fimbrillin-specific peptides, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), or heat-killed whole cell preparations to HUVEC stimulated modest IL-8 and MCP-1 responses. In contrast, coculture of HUVEC with live P. gingivalis strain A7436, 33277, or 381 abolished the IL-8 and MCP-1 responses. Inhibition of IL-8 and MCP-1 production was not dependent on bacterial adherence since similar results were obtained with the nonadherent P. gingivalis fimA mutant DPG3 or when P. gingivalis was preincubated with fimbrillin peptide antisera prior to the addition to HUVEC. Furthermore, treatment of P. gingivalis-infected HUVEC with cytochalsin D, which prevented P. gingivalis invasion, also abolished the constitutive IL-8 and MCP-1 responses. Treatment of HUVEC with E. coli LPS stimulated robust IL-8 and MCP-1 responses that were abolished when stimulated cells were cocultured with live P. gingivalis. Analysis of P. gingivalis-infected HUVEC cultures by an RNase protection assay revealed an increase in the IL-8 transcript relative to uninfected HUVEC. Pretreatment of P. gingivalis with protease inhibitors prior to the addition to HUVEC prevented the inhibition of IL-8 and MCP-1 production in P. gingivalis-infected HUVEC, indicating that the inhibition was proteolytically mediated. Coculture of HUVEC with a P. gingivalis mutant deficient in lysine-specific cysteine proteinase (gingipain K [Kgp]) resulted in an increase in both IL-8 transcription and protein expression relative to that observed in HUVEC cocultured with the P. gingivalis wild-type strain. These results indicate that P. gingivalis can temporally modulate the chemokine response in endothelial cells through both fimbriae and gingipain-mediated mechanisms.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. To investigate the roles of TLRs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both TLR2- and TLR4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human CD14 and TLRs. When the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, Escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced NF-kappaB-dependent CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR2 cells. Although freeze-dried A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli also induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, freeze-dried P. gingivalis did not. Similarly, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, but LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea did not. Furthermore, LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea attenuated CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from U373 cells, the secretion of IL-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and ICAM-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. These findings indicated that LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea worked as antagonists for human TLR4. The antagonistic activity of LPS from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans LuxS.
AB  - The cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. Although periodontal organisms do not appear to secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer II (AI-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in Vibrio harveyi. Here, we report that the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of V. harveyi luxS and secretes an AI-2-like signal. Cell-free conditioned medium from A. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain (E. coli AIS) expressing A. actinomycetemcomitans luxS induced luminescence in V. harveyi BB170 >200-fold over controls. AI-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. Incubation of early-log-phase A. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from A. actinomycetemcomitans or from E. coli AIS resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. In contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from E. coli AIS(-), a recombinant strain in which luxS was insertionally inactivated. A. actinomycetemcomitans AI-2 also induced expression of afuA, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that LuxS-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Finally, A. actinomycetemcomitans AI-2 added in trans complemented a luxS knockout mutation in P. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxS-regulated genes uvrB and hasF in this organism. Together, these results suggest that LuxS-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by A. actinomycetemcomitans and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.
TI  - Bacterial fimbriae and their peptides activate human gingival epithelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - Gingival epithelial cells are a central component of the barrier between oral microflora and internal tissues. Host responses to periodontopathic bacteria and surface components containing fimbriae are thought to be important in the development and progression of periodontal diseases. To elucidate this mechanism, we established immortalized human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) that were transfected with human papillomavirus. HGEC predominantly expressed Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, but not TLR4 or CD14. They also induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) production when stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae and Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan, but not Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A. Furthermore, an active synthetic peptide composed of residues 69 to 73 (ALTTE) of the fimbrial subunit protein, derived from P. gingivalis and similar to a common component of cell wall peptidoglycans in parasitic bacteria, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP), significantly induced IL-8 production and NF-kappaB activation in HGEC, and these cytokine-producing activities were augmented by a complex of soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). IL-8 production in HGEC stimulated with these bacterial components was clearly inhibited by mouse monoclonal antibody to human TLR2. These findings suggest that P. gingivalis fimbrial protein and its active peptide are capable of activating HGEC through TLR2.
TI  - Differential induction of endotoxin tolerance by lipopolysaccharides derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Exposure of mononuclear phagocytes to enterobacterial LPS induces a state of transient hyporesponsiveness to subsequent LPS exposure, termed endotoxin tolerance. In the present study, LPS derived from the oral periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis, was compared with that derived from the enterobacterium, Escherichia coli, for the ability to induce endotoxin tolerance. Pretreatment of the human macrophage cell line, THP-1, with E. coli LPS resulted in a severe reduction in the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha upon secondary stimulation. In contrast, pretreatment of THP-1 cells with P. gingivalis LPS resulted in a mitigation of IL-1beta, but not IL-6 and TNF-alpha production upon subsequent exposure to P. gingivalis LPS: primary or secondary stimulation with < or =100 ng/ml P. gingivalis LPS resulted in comparable levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, while stimulation of THP-1 cells with > or =1 microg/ml P. gingivalis LPS induced a significant enhancement in IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels upon secondary exposure. To identify possible mechanisms for these differences, changes in the expression of molecules involved in the LPS-signaling pathway were assessed. Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with E. coli LPS resulted in a significant reduction in surface Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression and an inability to degrade I-kappaB-alpha or I-kappaB-beta proteins upon secondary stimulation. In contrast, pretreatment of THP-1 cells with P. gingivalis LPS resulted in a significant enhancement of both CD14 and TLR2, while maintaining the ability to degrade I-kappaB-beta only upon secondary stimulation. Thus, E. coli and P. gingivalis LPS differentially affect CD14 and TLR expression as well as secondary LPS-associated responses.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from distinct pathogens induce different classes of immune responses in vivo.
AB  - The adaptive immune system has evolved distinct responses against different pathogens, but the mechanism(s) by which a particular response is initiated is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the type of Ag-specific CD4(+) Th and CD8(+) T cell responses elicited in vivo, in response to soluble OVA, coinjected with LPS from two different pathogens. We used Escherichia coli LPS, which signals through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and LPS from the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, which does not appear to require TLR4 for signaling. Coinjections of E. coli LPS + OVA or P. gingivalis LPS + OVA induced similar clonal expansions of OVA-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, but strikingly different cytokine profiles. E. coli LPS induced a Th1-like response with abundant IFN-gamma, but little or no IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5. In contrast, P. gingivalis LPS induced Th and T cell responses characterized by significant levels of IL-13, IL-5, and IL-10, but lower levels of IFN-gamma. Consistent with these results, E. coli LPS induced IL-12(p70) in the CD8alpha(+) dendritic cell (DC) subset, while P. gingivalis LPS did not. Both LPS, however, activated the two DC subsets to up-regulate costimulatory molecules and produce IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Interestingly, these LPS appeared to have differences in their ability to signal through TLR4; proliferation of splenocytes and cytokine secretion by splenocytes or DCs from TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice were greatly impaired in response to E. coli LPS, but not P. gingivalis LPS. Therefore, LPS from different bacteria activate DC subsets to produce different cytokines, and induce distinct types of adaptive immunity in vivo.
TI  - Mature dendritic cells infiltrate the T cell-rich region of oral mucosa in chronic periodontitis: in situ, in vivo, and in vitro studies.
AB  - Previous studies have analyzed the lymphoid and myeloid foci within the gingival  mucosa in health and chronic periodontitis (CP); however, the principal APCs responsible for the formation and organizational structure of these foci in CP have not been defined. We show that in human CP tissues, CD1a(+) immature Langerhans cells predominantly infiltrate the gingival epithelium, whereas CD83(+) mature dendritic cells (DCs) specifically infiltrate the CD4(+) lymphoid-rich lamina propria. In vivo evidence shows that exacerbation of CP results in increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines that mediate DC activation/maturation, but also of counterregulatory cytokines that may prevent a Th-polarized response. Consistently, in vitro-generated monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381 or its LPS undergo maturation, up-regulate accessory molecules, and release proinflammatory (IL-1beta, PGE(2)) and Th (IL-10, IL-12) cytokines. Interestingly, the IL-10:IL-12 ratio elicited from P. gingivalis-pulsed DCs was 3-fold higher than that from Escherichia coli-pulsed DCs. This may account for the significantly (p < 0.05) lower proliferation of autologous CD4(+) T cells and reduced release of IFN-gamma elicited by P. gingivalis-pulsed DCs. Taken together, these findings suggest a previously unreported mechanism for the pathophysiology of CP, involving the activation and in situ maturation of DCs by the oral pathogen P. gingivalis, leading to release of counterregulatory cytokines and the formation of T cell-DC foci.
TI  - Signal integration in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages.
AB  - Using a panel of LPS-inducible genes, selected for the capacity of their products to contribute to endotoxicity, normal macrophages were compared to macrophages deficient in CD14, CD11b/CD18, or TLR4 to elicit gene expression in response to Escherichia coli LPS or the LPS mimetic, Taxol. All genes were TLR4-dependent. At low doses of LPS or Taxol, all genes were also CD14-dependent; however, IP-10 and ICSBP remained poorly inducible even at much higher concentrations. A distinct subset of genes (COX-2, IL-12 p40, and IL-12 p35) was CD11b/CD18-dependent. NF-B translocation and MAPK phosphorylation were dysregulated in receptor-deficient macrophages. In contrast to E. coli LPS, a Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS preparation was found to be TLR2-, rather than TLR4-dependent, and resulted in differential expression of genes within the panel. These data suggest that: (i) TLR4 is necessary, but not sufficient, to induce the full repertoire of genes examined; (ii) CD14 and CD11b/CD18 facilitate signaling for induction of select subsets of genes that are also TLR4-dependent; and (iii) signaling through TLR2 versus TLR4 differs quantitatively/qualitatively. These data support an LPS signaling complex on murine macrophages that minimally includes CD14, CD11b/CD18, and TLR4 to respond to E. coli LPS to elicit the full spectrum of gene expression.
TI  - Comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppGpp synthetases/hydrolases (the Rel, RelA and SpoT proteins).
AB  - In the gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppGpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, RelA and SpoT, whereas in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis only one enzyme named Rel is responsible for this activity. Rel and SpoT also possess (p)ppGpp hydrolase activity. BLAST searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. The construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. Four groups could be distinguished: With the exception of Neisseria and Bordetella (beta subdivision), the RelA and SpoT groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. Two Rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the Bacillus/Clostridium group were also identified. The SpoT proteins are related to the gram positive Rel proteins. RelA proteins carry substitutions in the HD domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1998, TIBS 23: 469-472) responsible for ppGpp degradation. A theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous relA and spoT genes is presented: After gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spoT and relA genes evolved from the duplicated genes. The distribution pattern of the paralogous RelA and SpoT proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (Gupta, 2000, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 24: 367-402). This model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. However, two paralogous, closely related genes of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the RelA and SpoT proteins do not fit in this model. Completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia species, Rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont Buchnera sp. APS as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes but they are present in the Arabidopsis genome. In crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppGpp as crosslinking reagents and RNA polymerase preparations of Escherichia coli, binding of ppGpp to distinct regions at the C-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoB gene product) and/or at the N-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoC gene product) was observed previously. RpoB and RpoC sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppGpp binding regions.
TI  - Binding specificity of the Porphyromonas gingivalis heme and hemoglobin receptor  HmuR, gingipain K, and gingipain R1 for heme, porphyrins, and metalloporphyrins.
AB  - Previous genetic and biochemical studies have confirmed that hemoglobin and hemin utilization in Porphyromonas gingivalis is mediated by the outer membrane hemoglobin and heme receptor HmuR, as well as gingipain K (Kgp), a lysine-specific cysteine protease, and gingipain R1 (HRgpA), one of two arginine-specific cysteine proteases. In this study we report on the binding specificity of the recombinant P. gingivalis HmuR protein and native gingipains for hemoglobin, hemin, various porphyrins, and metalloporphyrins as assessed by spectrophotometric assays, by affinity chromatography, and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Protoporphyrin, mesoporphyrin, deuteroporphyrin, hematoporphyrin, and some of their iron, copper, and zinc derivatives were examined to evaluate the role of both the central metal ion and the peripheral substituents on binding to recombinant HmuR and soluble gingipains. Scatchard analysis of hemin binding to Escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant membrane-associated six-His-tagged HmuR yielded a linear plot with a binding affinity of 2.4 x 10(-5) M. Recombinant E. coli cells bound the iron, copper, and zinc derivatives of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) with similar affinities, and approximately four times more tightly than PPIX itself, which suggests that the active site of HmuR contains a histidine that binds the metal ion in the porphyrin ring. Furthermore, we found that recombinant HmuR prefers the ethyl and vinyl side chains of the PPIX molecule to either the larger hydroxyethyl or smaller hydrogen side chains. Kgp and HRgpA were demonstrated to bind various porphyrins and metalloporphyrins with affinities similar to those for hemin, indicating that the binding of Kgp and HRgpA to these porphyrins does not require a metal within the porphyrin ring. We did not detect the binding of RgpB, the arginine-specific cysteine protease that lacks a C-terminal hemagglutinin domain, to hemoglobin, porphyrins, or metalloporphyrins. Kgp and HRgpA, but not RgpB, were demonstrated to bind directly to soluble recombinant six-His-tagged HmuR. Several possible mechanisms for the cooperation between outer membrane receptor HmuR and proteases Kgp and HRgpA in hemin and hemoglobin binding and utilization are discussed.
TI  - Regulation of cytokine production in human gingival fibroblasts following treatment with nicotine and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who smoke are at increased risk for chronic periodontitis (CP). Most studies suggest that the microbial flora in these patients is similar to that found in non-smoking CP patients. Thus, the increased risk for development of CP is not dependent on an altered microbial profile, but rather to some change in the host response to these periopathogens. There is evidence that human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) derived from diseased sites produce greater amounts of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in vitro than cells derived from healthy sites. This suggests that HGF subpopulations may be selected based upon the inflammatory milieu in which they reside. The hypothesis to be tested was that the combination of nicotine and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could regulate HGF inflammatory mediator production. METHODS: HGF cell cultures were established from explants derived from 10 patients with CP. HGF cell cultures were stimulated with 1 mM, 1 microM, or 1 nM nicotine +/- Escherichia coli or Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS. At 12, 24, or 48-hour time points, the cells were counted and the supernatant was collected for subsequent IL-6 and IL-8 determination in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: At the 24-hour time point, 1 nM nicotine stimulated IL-6 production compared to control (P=0.02). E. coli LPS alone caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in IL-6 and IL-8 production, whereas P gingivalis LPS did not augment IL-6 or IL-8. A synergistic effect upregulating IL-6 was observed with combined treatment of 1 mM nicotine and E. coli LPS or P gingivalis LPS at the 24-hour time point (P<0.0005 and P=0.002, respectively). Similar effects were seen when IL-8 production was evaluated following HGF stimulation with high doses of nicotine and E. coli LPS or P gingivalis LPS. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that nicotine by itself can stimulate HGF IL-6 and IL-8 production. Moreover, the combination of high doses of nicotine and either E. coli or P gingivalis LPS can synergistically upregulate cytokine production. These findings support the hypothesis that a proinflammatory fibroblast phenotype may be elicited in an environment enriched with bacterial LPS and nicotine.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide: an unusual pattern recognition receptor ligand for the innate host defense system.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key inflammatory mediator. Due to its ability to potently activate host inflammatory and innate defense responses, it has been proposed to function as an important molecule that alerts the host of potential bacterial infection. However, although highly conserved, LPS contains important structural differences among different bacterial species that can significantly alter host responses. For example, LPS obtained from Porphyromonas gingivalis, an etiologic agent for periodontitis, causes a highly unusual host innate host response. It is an agonist for human monocytes and an antagonist for human endothelial cells. Correspondingly, although it activates p38 MAP kinase in human monocytes, P. gingivalis LPS does not activate p38 nor ERK MAP kinase in endothelial cells. In fact, P. gingivalis LPS is an effective inhibitor of Escherichia coli LPS induced p38 phosphorylation. These data show that P. gingivalis LPS modulates host defenses in endothelial cells by interfering with MAP kinase activation. In addition, P. gingivalis LPS is unusual in that it engages TLR-2 but not TLR-4 when examined in stably transfected CHO cell lines. We propose that, since LPS is a key ligand for the human innate host defense system, these unusual properties of P. gingivalis LPS are associated with the bacterium's role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.
TI  - Identification of vaccine candidate antigens from a genomic analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key periodontal pathogen which has been implicated  in the etiology of chronic adult periodontitis. Our aim was to develop a protein based vaccine for the prevention and or treatment of this disease. We used a whole genome sequencing approach to identify potential vaccine candidates. From a genomic sequence, we selected 120 genes using a series of bioinformatics methods. The selected genes were cloned for expression in Escherichia coli and screened with P. gingivalis antisera before purification and testing in an animal model. Two of these recombinant proteins (PG32 and PG33) demonstrated significant protection in the animal model, while a number were reactive with various antisera. This process allows the rapid identification of vaccine candidates from genomic data.
TI  - Elevated mRNA expression for supervillin and vascular endothelial growth factor in human neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Differential gene expression was examined in human neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis-LPS) using RNA fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR). LPS from Escherichia coli (E. coli-LPS) was used as control. More than 200 differently expressed transcripts were found in 8 subjects showing differential regulation at the transcriptional level. Densitometric analyses revealed that 42-100 genes were upregulated, while 53-116 genes were downregulated by P. gingivalis-LPS compared with E. coli-LPS. The results of sequencing identification showed the presence of supervillin (SVIL) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes in the clones which were upregulated by P. gingivalis-LPS. Consequently, semiquantitative analyses proved that the level of mRNA for SVIL and VEGF were significantly higher in P. gingivalis-LPS-stimulated neutrophils than in other bacterial (E. coli, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia) LPS- or synthetic lipid A-stimulated neutrophils. Our findings suggest that an elevated mRNA expression for SVIL could be associated with impaired function of neutrophils when stimulated by P. gingivalis-LPS. Further, the VEGF mRNA over-expression might be related to the pathogenesis of P. gingivalis-associated periodontitis. The RAP-PCR technique used in this study enabled us to identify a number of P. gingivalis-LPS regulated genes which hitherto have not been reported.
TI  - Kappacin, a novel antibacterial peptide from bovine milk.
AB  - Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a heterogeneous C-terminal fragment (residues 106 to 169) of bovine milk kappa-casein composed of glycosylated and phosphorylated forms of different genetic variants. We have demonstrated that CMP has growth-inhibitory activity against the oral opportunistic pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis and against Escherichia coli. CMP was fractionated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and each fraction was tested for activity against S. mutans in a 96-well-plate broth assay. Fractions were characterized by N-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. The active form of CMP was shown to be the nonglycosylated, phosphorylated kappa-casein (residues 106 to 169) [kappa-casein(106--169)], which we have designated kappacin. Endoproteinase Glu-C was used to hydrolyze CMP, and the generated peptides were separated using RP-HPLC and gel filtration-HPLC and then tested for activity against S. mutans. The peptide Ser(P)(149)kappa-casein-A(138--158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase Glu-C digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide Ser(P)(149)kappa-casein-A(138--158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart kappa-casein-A(138--158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. The synthetic Ser(P)(149) kappa-casein-A(138--158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against S. mutans (MIC, 59 microg/ml [26 microM]). The nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity.
TI  - Sodium ion-driven serine/threonine transport in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is an asaccharolytic, gram-negative bacterium that relies on the fermentation of amino acids for metabolic energy. When grown in continuous culture in complex medium containing 4 mM (each) free serine, threonine, and arginine, P. gingivalis assimilated mainly glutamate/glutamine, serine, threonine, aspartate/asparagine, and leucine in free and/or peptide form. Serine and threonine were assimilated in approximately equal amounts in free and peptide form. We characterized serine transport in this bacterium by measuring uptake of the radiolabeled amino acid in washed cells of P. gingivalis energized with a tetrapeptide not containing serine. Serine was transported by a single system with an affinity constant for transport (K(t)) of 24 microM that was competitively inhibited by threonine. Serine transport was dependent on sodium ion concentration in the suspending buffer, and the addition of the ionophore gramicidin caused the inhibition of serine uptake. Together these data indicate that serine transport was sodium ion-motive force driven. A P. gingivalis gene potentially encoding a serine transporter was identified by sequence similarity to an Escherichia coli serine transporter (SstT). This P. gingivalis gene, designated sstT, was inactivated by insertion of a Bacteroides tetQ gene, producing the mutant W50ST. The mutant was unable to transport serine, confirming the presence of a single serine transporter in this bacterium under these growth conditions. The transport of serine by P. gingivalis was dependent on the presence of free cysteine in the suspension buffer. Other reducing agents were unable to stimulate serine uptake. These data show that P. gingivalis assimilates free serine and threonine from culture media via a cysteine-activated, sodium ion-motive force-driven serine/threonine transporter.
TI  - The effect of oral bacteria on Candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  - A total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral Candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. Briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a C. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive Candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. In general, out of eight bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis SK21A, Streptococcus salivarius SK56, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and S. salivarius OBU3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different C albicans isolates. Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg 50, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469 and Prevotella intermedia OBU4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas S. sanguis OBU 2 had no effect. E. coli ATCC 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). A significant increase in the germ tube production of C. albicans isolated from HIV-infected compared with HIV-free individuals was also noted. The current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of C. albicans isolates.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in human subgingival plaque.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in the human subgingival plaque by using culture-independent molecular methods as part of an ongoing effort to obtain full 16S rRNA sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of human oral bacteria. Subgingival plaque was analyzed from healthy subjects and subjects with refractory periodontitis, adult periodontitis, human immunodeficiency virus periodontitis, and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) bacterial genes from DNA isolated from subgingival plaque samples were PCR amplified with all-bacterial or selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. The sequences of cloned 16S rDNA inserts were used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species. A total of 2,522 clones were analyzed. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for putative new species. About 60% of the clones fell into 132 known species, 70 of which were identified from multiple subjects. About 40% of the clones were novel phylotypes. Of the 215 novel phylotypes, 75 were identified from multiple subjects. Known putative periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, and Treponema denticola were identified from multiple subjects, but typically as a minor component of the plaque as seen in cultivable studies. Several phylotypes fell into two recently described phyla previously associated with extreme natural environments, for which there are no cultivable species. A number of species or phylotypes were found only in subjects with disease, and a few were found only in healthy subjects. The organisms identified only from diseased sites deserve further study as potential pathogens. Based on the sequence data in this study, the predominant subgingival microbial community consisted of 347 species or phylotypes that fall into 9 bacterial phyla. Based on the 347 species seen in our sample of 2,522 clones, we estimate that there are 68 additional unseen species, for a total estimate of 415 species in the subgingival plaque. When organisms found on other oral surfaces such as the cheek, tongue, and teeth are added to this number, the best estimate of the total species diversity in the oral cavity is approximately 500 species, as previously proposed.
TI  - Downregulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression via EP2/EP4 receptors by prostaglandin E2 in human fibroblasts.
AB  - In the present study, the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was investigated. LPS were isolated from periodontopathic bacteria, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), by the phenol-water method and Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS was used as a control. PGE2 significantly inhibited A. actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression. Next, of four PGE2 receptor subtypes (EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4), we examined which subtype(s) was involved in inhibition of LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression by PGE2. Eleven-deoxy-PGE1, a selective EP2/EP4 agonist, and butaprost, a selective EP2 agonist, attenuated A. actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression, although butaprost was less potent than PGE2 and 11-deoxy-PGE1. Sulprostone, an EP1/EP3 agonist, and ONO-AP-324, an EP3 agonist, was inert to the LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP, a cAMP analogue, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, downregulated A. actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression in HGF. Our data suggest that PGE2 downregulates A. actinomycetemcomitans- and P. gingivalis-LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression in HGF, via EP2/EP4 receptors by cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. The cAMP-elevating agents such as EP2/EP4 receptor activators may serve to control inflammatory and immune responses in periodontal disease.
TI  - Periodontal pathogens produce quorum sensing signal molecules.
AB  - Different species of bacteria important in the composition of dental plaque were  tested for production of extracellular autoinducer-like activities that stimulate the expression of the luminescence genes in Vibrio harveyi. Several strains of Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were found to produce such activities. Interestingly, these bacteria belong to the same phylogenetic group, and they are periodontal pathogens important in the development of periodontal disease. They specifically produce extracellular signaling molecule related autoinducer-2 from V. haveyi. Nevertheless, they seem to be unable to produce homologues of acyl-homoserine lactones. Furthermore, Escherichia coli DH5alpha can be complemented by the introduction of a P. gingivalis gene with high homology to the luxS gene, which has been called luxS(P.g.).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from Magnolia officinalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of Magnolia officinalis was investigated. The antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. The results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (MIC = 25 microg/mL) against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (MIC > or = 100 microg/mL) for Shigella flexneii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. Hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - Both tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the synthesis of t-PA and PAI-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). LPS from different periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. The levels of t-PA and PAI-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The mRNA for t-PA and PAI-2 were measured by RT-PCR. The results showed t-PA synthesis was increased in response to all types of LPS studied and PAI-2 level was increased by LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, but not P. gingivalis. When comparing the effects of LPS from non-periodontal bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) with the LPS from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-PA to PAI-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to LPS from periodontal pathogens. The highest ratio of t-PA to PAI-2 was found in those cells exposed to LPS from P. gingivalis. These results indicate that LPS derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by HGF and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.
TI  - Production of inflammatory cytokines by human gingival fibroblasts stimulated by  cell-surface preparations of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative rod associated with the progression of human periodontal disease. Inflammatory cytokines are believed to be the major pathological mediators in periodontal diseases. We therefore investigated the productions of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in human gingival fibroblasts treated with lipopolysaccharide, polysaccharide and outer-membrane proteins from P. gingivalis ATCC 53977. Outer-membrane protein from P. gingivalis enhanced the production of IL-6 and IL-8 from the cells of periodontium in vitro as well as lipopolysaccharide did. The IL-8 production activity of polysaccharide from P. gingivalis was higher than that of other cell-surface components. The levels of IL-6 and IL-8 released from the P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-treated human gingival fibroblasts were lower than those of the same cells treated with lipopolysaccharides from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli. Rabbit antisera against either outer-membrane protein or lipopolysaccharide inhibited the IL-6 and IL-8 production derived from human gingival fibroblasts stimulated sonicated supernatants from P. gingivalis. The present study suggests that, in addition to lipopolysaccharide, outer-membrane protein and polysaccharide of P. gingivalis are also pathological mediators in periodontal diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB  - Endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located in confined areas of the root canal system. The antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT, Grossman's Sealer, ThermaSeal, Sealer 26, AH Plus, and Sealer Plus. The agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. In the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. The diameters of the formed discs were recorded. All root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. There were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). All root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that AH Plus and Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT had flow values significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.
TI  - Signaling by toll-like receptor 2 and 4 agonists results in differential gene expression in murine macrophages.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has been reported to differ structurally and functionally from enterobacterial LPS. These studies demonstrate that in contrast to protein-free enterobacterial LPS, a similarly purified preparation of P. gingivalis LPS exhibited potent Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), rather than TLR4, agonist activity to elicit gene expression and cytokine secretion in murine macrophages and transfectants. More importantly, TLR2 stimulation by this P. gingivalis LPS preparation resulted in differential expression of a panel of genes that are normally induced in murine macrophages by Escherichia coli LPS. These data suggest that (i) P. gingivalis LPS does not signal through TLR4 and (ii) signaling through TLR2 and through TLR4 differs quantitatively and qualitatively. Our data support the hypothesis that the shared signaling pathways elicited by TLR2 and by TLR4 agonists must diverge in order to account for the distinct patterns of inflammatory gene expression.
TI  - Cloning, characterization, and possible origin of the Prevotella loescheii dnaK homolog.
AB  - Heat shock proteins play an important role in bacterial survival and response to  environmental stress. We cloned the Prevotella loescheii HSP70 homolog (dnaK) and characterized the coding sequence, regulatory regions, and evolutionary relationships to other bacteria. Predicted proteins encoded by the P. loescheii dnaK homolog (open reading frame ORF-1) and two downstream coding regions, ORF-2 and ORF-3, are highly homologous to the proteins encoded by ORF-4 (dnaK), ORF-5, and ORF-6 from the dnaK region of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The dnaK promoter resembles other HSP (heat shock protein) promoters. Alignment of the predicted protein encoded by ORF-2 showed significant homology to the Bacteroides fragilis tnpA gene from the transposon Tn4555, whereas the ORF-3 protein showed homology to B. fragilis transposase (Tn5220) and integrase (Tn4555) proteins. This suggests a transposition-like event may be responsible for transfer of these genes between Porphyromonas and Prevotella.
TI  - Formation of methyl mercaptan from L-methionine by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Methyl mercaptan production by oral bacteria is thought to be one of the main causes of oral malodor. We examined the ability of periodontopathic Porphyromonas gingivalis to produce methyl mercaptan from L-methionine and found that the invasive strains W83 and W50 produced large amounts of methyl mercaptan. We cloned and sequenced the mgl gene encoding L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (METase) from P. gingivalis W83. The structural mgl gene consisted of 1,200 bp and encoded a 43.3-kDa protein. To examine the role of methyl mercaptan in the pathogenesis of P. gingivalis, a METase-deficient mutant of P. gingivalis W83 was constructed. The methionine degradation activity and virulence of the mutant (M1217) and the parent strain (W83) in mice were compared. M1217 showed a marked decrease in the formation of methyl mercaptan from L-methionine and decreased virulence compared with the wild-type strain W83. These results suggest that methyl mercaptan not only is one of the sources of oral malodor, but may also play a role in the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Fermentation of 4-aminobutyrate by Clostridium aminobutyricum: cloning of two genes involved in the formation and dehydration of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.
AB  - Clostridium aminobutyricum ferments 4-aminobutyrate via succinic semialdehyde, 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA to acetate and butyrate. The genes coding for the enzymes that catalyse the interconversion of these intermediates are arranged in the order abfD (4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase), abfT (4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase), and abfH (NAD-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase). The genes abfD and abfT were cloned, sequenced and expressed as active enzymes in Escherichia coli. Hence the insertion of the [4Fe-4S]clusters and FAD into the dehydratase required no additional specific protein from C. aminobutyricum. The amino acid sequences of the dehydratase and the CoA-transferase revealed close relationships to proteins deduced from the genomes of Clostridium difficile, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. In addition the N-terminal part of the dehydratase is related to those of a family of FAD-containing mono-oxygenases from bacteria. The putative assignment in the databank of Cat2 (OrfZ) from Clostridium kluyveri as 4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase, which is thought to be involved in the reductive pathway from succinate to butyrate, was confirmed by sequence comparison with AbfT (57% identity). Furthermore, an acetyl-CoA:4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase activity could be detected in cell-free extracts of C. kluyveri. In contrast to glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans, mutation studies suggested that the glutamate residue of the motive EXG, which is conserved in many homologues of AbfT, does not form a CoA-ester during catalysis.
TI  - Characterization and expression of HmuR, a TonB-dependent hemoglobin receptor of  Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The gram-negative pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis requires hemin for growth. Hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin and hemin complexed to hemopexin can be used as heme sources, indicating that P. gingivalis must have a means to remove the hemin from these host iron-binding proteins. However, the specific mechanisms utilized by P. gingivalis for the extraction of heme from heme-binding proteins and for iron transport are poorly understood. In this study we have determined that a newly identified TonB-dependent hemoglobin-hemin receptor (HmuR) is involved in hemoglobin binding and utilization in P. gingivalis A7436. HmuR shares amino acid homology with TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, including HemR of Yersinia enterocolitica, ShuA of Shigella dysenteriae, HpuB of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, HmbR of N. meningitidis, HgbA of Haemophilus ducreyi, and HgpB of H. influenzae. Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the hmuR gene and revealed genetic variability in the carboxy terminus of hmuR in P. gingivalis strains 33277, 381, W50, and 53977. We also identified directly upstream of the hmuR gene a gene which we designated hmuY. Upstream of the hmuY start codon, a region with homology to the Fur binding consensus sequence was identified. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that hmuR and hmuY were cotranscribed and that transcription was negatively regulated by iron. Inactivation of hmuR resulted in a decreased ability of P. gingivalis to bind hemoglobin and to grow with hemoglobin or hemin as sole iron sources. Escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant HmuR were shown to bind hemoglobin and hemin. Furthermore, purified recombinant HmuR was demonstrated to bind hemoglobin. Taken together, these results indicate that HmuR serves as the major TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor involved in the utilization of both hemin and hemoglobin in P. gingivalis.
TI  - Effect of the interleukin-1 genotype on monocyte IL-1beta expression in subjects  with adult periodontitis.
AB  - An association has been reported between polymorphisms in the genes encoding IL-1alpha (-889) and IL-1beta (+3953) (periodontitis susceptibility trait, PST), and an increased severity of periodontitis (18). The IL-1beta polymorphism was reported to correlate with increased IL-1beta expression by monocytes in response to bacterial stimulants. In the present study, we determined if PST positive subjects with periodontitis exhibit elevated production of IL-1beta, compared to PST negative periodontitis patients. Peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from 10 PST+ and 10 PST- age- and disease-balanced subjects with adult forms of periodontitis. Monocytes were cultured with a panel of bacterial stimulants, including Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS, and whole formalinized periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Prevotella intermedia, and health-associated organisms Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus sanguis. Our results demonstrate that monocytes from PST+ and PST- patients showed no significant differences in IL-1beta production in response to any stimulant tested. In addition, the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. intermedia failed to stimulate higher IL-1beta responses compared to health-associated species V. parvula and S. sanguis. A marked interindividual variation in production of IL-1beta was seen, with high, low and intermediate responders present in both PST+ and PST- groups. We conclude that genetic loci other than the PST polymorphisms are also important regulators of monocyte IL-1 responses.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the rml gene homologs from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - We cloned four genes from the Porphyromonas gingivalis chromosome, the gene products of which catalyze the anabolism of dTDP-L-rhamnose from D-glucose-1-phosphate when they were expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequences deduced from these genes showed significant homology to proteins encoded by the rml genes involved in dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis in other gram-negative bacteria. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that these four genes are expressed as a single transcript in P. gingivalis. To clarify the role of the rml gene homologs in this organism, construction of mutants defective in the rml gene homologs was attempted by allelic exchange. Unexpectedly, any mutants defective in the rml gene homologs were unable to be isolated, and the allelic exchange was possible only if the wild-type rml gene homologs were present on the chromosome. These results suggest that the rml gene homologs might be essential for the viability of P. gingivalis under the culture conditions used in this study.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of a chemically synthesized lipid A of Porphyromonas  gingivalis.
AB  - A synthetic lipid A of Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381 (compound PG-381), which is similar to its natural lipid A, demonstrated no or very low endotoxic activities as compared to Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A (compound 506). On the other hand, compound PG-381 had stronger hemagglutinating activities on rabbit erythrocytes than compound 506. Compound PG-381 also induced mitogenic responses in spleen cells from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice, as well as LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice. The addition of polymyxin B resulted in the inhibition of mitogenic activities, however, compound 506 did not show these capacities. Additionally, compound PG-381 showed a lower level of activity in inducing cytokine production in peritoneal macrophages and gingival fibroblasts from C3H/HeN mice, but not C3H/HeJ mice, in comparison to compound 506. Thus, this study demonstrates that the chemical synthesis of lipid A, mimicking the natural lipid A portion of LPS from P. gingivalis, confirms its low endotoxic potency and immunobiological activity.
TI  - Epitope mapping of heat shock protein 60 (GroEL) from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a putative pathogen in human periodontal disease, possesses a 60-kDa heat shock protein (hsp60, GroEL). The GroEL homologs are known to be key molecules in auto-immune reactions because of the sequence similarity with human hsp60. In this study, B-cell epitopes on P. gingivalis GroEL (PgGroEL) were analyzed by both Western immunoblotting with truncated PgGroEL and by the multi-pin synthetic peptide approach. To examine auto-antibody production in periodontitis patients, Western immunoblotting with human gingival fibroblasts was performed. Deletion mutants were constructed from the cloned PgGroEL gene (P. gingivalis groEL), and four C-terminal truncated PgGroEL and one N-terminal truncated PgGroEL were prepared from the deletants. Sera from periodontitis patients reacted with all truncated PgGroEL used in this study. The results suggest that the B-cell epitopes were overlaid throughout PgGroEL. To determine the detailed locations of the B-cell epitope, 84 decapeptides covering the entire PgGroEL were synthesized and the serum IgG response to the peptides was examined. Epitope mapping using the synthetic peptides confirmed that the B-cell epitopes were overlaid throughout the length of PgGroEL and revealed that highly conserved peptides between PgGroEL and human hsp60 were recognized by the serum antibodies. Immuno-reactivity against human gingival fibroblasts was examined with sera from 30 periodontitis patients and 10 periodontally healthy subjects. IgG antibody against the 65-kDa antigen in human gingival fibroblasts (same molecular mass as human hsp60) was detected in two patients. Although IgG production against human hsp60 may be rare case in periodontitis patients, the results of epitope mapping demonstrated the potential of PgGroEL to cause the cross-reactions with human hsp60.
TI  - Crystal structure of cambialistic superoxide dismutase from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The crystal structure of cambialistic superoxide dismutase (SOD) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, which exhibits full activity with either Fe or Mn at the active site, has been determined at 1.8-A resolution by molecular replacement and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 17.9% (Rfree 22.3%). The crystals belong to the space group P212121 (a = 75.5 A, b = 102.7 A, c = 99.6 A) with four identical subunits in the asymmetric unit. Each pair of subunits forms a compact dimer, but not a tetramer, with 222 point symmetry. Each subunit has 191 amino-acid residues most of which are visible in electron density maps, and consists of seven alpha helices and one three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet. The metal ion, a 3 : 1 mixture of Fe and Mn, is coordinated with five ligands (His27, His74, His161, Asp157, and water) arranged at the vertices of a trigonal bipyramid. Although the overall structural features, including the metal coordination geometry, are similar to those found in other single-metal containing SODs, P. gingivalis SOD more closely resembles the dimeric Fe-SODs from Escherichia coli rather than another cambialistic SOD from Propionibacterium shermanii, which itself is rather similar to other tetrameric SODs.
TI  - Ferritin from the obligate anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis: purification, gene  cloning and mutant studies.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is an obligate anaerobe that utilizes haem, transferrin  and haemoglobin efficiently as sources of iron for growth, and has the ability to store haem on its cell surface, resulting in black pigmentation of colonies on blood agar plates. However, little is known about intracellular iron storage in this organism. Ferritin is one of the intracellular iron-storage proteins and may also contribute to the protection of organisms against oxidative stresses generated by intracellular free iron. A ferritin-like protein was purified from P. gingivalis and the encoding gene (ftn) was cloned from chromosomal DNA using information on its amino-terminal amino acid sequence. Comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of ftn with those of known ferritins and bacterioferritins identified the protein as a ferritin and positioned it between proteins from the Proteobacteria and Thermotogales. The P. gingivalis ferritin was found to contain non-haem iron, thus confirming its identity. Construction and characterization of a P. gingivalis ferritin-deficient mutant revealed that the ferritin was particularly important for the bacterium to survive under iron-depleted conditions (both haemin and transferrin starvation), indicating that intracellular iron is stored in ferritin regardless of the iron source and that the iron stored in ferritin is utilized under iron-restricted conditions. However, the ferritin appeared not to contribute to protection against oxidative stresses caused by peroxides and atmospheric oxygen.
TI  - Characterization of the relA gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Based upon the nucleotide sequence of the relA gene from Escherichia coli, a gene fragment corresponding to the homologous gene from the pathogenic oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was isolated by PCR and utilized to construct a relA mutant. The mutant, KS7, was defective in ribosome-mediated ppGpp formation and also in the stringent response.
TI  - Inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by Fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
AB  - Human gingival epithelial cells (HGE) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) and hBD-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. In the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hBD-2 was examined. HBD-2 mRNA was induced by cell wall extract of Fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. HBD-2 mRNA was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an epithelial cell activator. HBD-2 mRNA was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed gingival tissue samples. HBD-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in HGE stimulated with F. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mRNA by this stimulant. Kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hBD-2 mRNA; TNF-alpha and F. nucleatum cell wall induced hBD-2 mRNA rapidly (2 to 4 h), while PMA stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). In contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) within 1 h. The role of TNF-alpha as an intermediary in F. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-TNF-alpha that did not inhibit hBD-2 induction. However, inhibitor studies show that F. nucleatum stimulation of hBD-2 mRNA requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from Escherichia coli and F. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hBD-2, although they up-regulated IL-8 mRNA. Collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hBD-2 mRNA via multiple pathways in HGE in a pattern that is distinct from that of IL-8 expression. We suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.
TI  - Overexpression, purification, and refolding of a Porphyromonas gingivalis cysteine protease from Escherichia coli.
AB  - This paper describes the overexpression of the Rgp-1 (arginine) protease domain from Porphyromonas gingivalis. This protease and the related Kgp (lysine) protease, both of which display trypsin-like specificity, have been implicated as major virulence factors and may play a significant role in the etiology of periodontal disease. Both Rgp-1 and Kgp are initially translated as polyproteins, each containing a protease domain and multiple adhesin domains. The Rgp-1 protease domain was expressed in E. coli, purified, refolded, and assayed for activity. These expression studies demonstrated that prior to the formation of inclusion bodies in the E. coli cytoplasm, the protease was proteolytically active and could hydrolyze a specific synthetic substrate. When the Rgp-1 protease domain was purified from inclusion bodies and refolded, it was found to be autolytically active and displayed specific catalytic activity. This is the first report on the expression and purification of active Rgp-1 from E. coli. Polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant protein recognized the native form of the protease in the P. gingivalis strain W50, indicating that the recombinant protein contained some of the antigenic determinants of the native protease.
TI  - Modulation of chronic enteric infection by distant oral infection.
AB  - This investigation determined the effects of a distant oral infection (Porphyromonas gingivalis) on a concurrent local enteric infection (Echerichia coli). A modified murine subcutaneous tissue chamber model was used. Subcutaneously implanted chambers with different microbial makeups were monitored for sloughing and their contents assayed for prostaglandin E2. Bilaterally implanted chamber experiments revealed that a distant "chronic" (immunization with heat-killed organism, followed by live challenge) P. gingivalis infection offered protection against a local chronic E. coli infection, as evidenced by delaying the time for 50% of the chambers to reject from day 19 to day 25 and a statistically significant prostaglandin E2 decrease from 529.4 +/- 176.6 ng/ml to 191.5 +/- 100.9 ng/ml (p < 0.01) (Mann-Whitney test). An acute (live challenge only) distant P. gingivalis infection or immunization with the heat-killed organism alone had no effect on "chronic" E. coli infection in this model. These data suggest that the presence of low-grade chronic oral infection may modify the responses to other infectious challenges.
TI  - Inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses to lipopolysaccharide from endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  - We examined the induction of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from several species of possible endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria. Studies were conducted in human whole blood cultures from six patients (two from each group) with differing numbers of periapical periodontitis lesions (i.e. patients with radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high-lesion group, n = 4), in one or two teeth (low-lesion group, n = 6), and six healthy volunteers with no periapical lesions (no lesion group)). LPS from Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, and Prophyromonas endodontalis ATCC 27067 induced a higher IL-8 response in the subjects of the high-lesion group, compared with the subjects of the other two groups. To ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the subjects to different bacterial species. LPS from P. gingivalis reacted strongly with sera from the high-lesion group. Thus, LPS from black-pigmented bacteria may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing particular cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.
TI  - Characterization of heat-inducible expression and cloning of HtpG (Hsp90 homologue) of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. Associations between microbial virulence and stress protein expression have been identified in other infections. For example, Hsp90 homologues in several microbial species have been shown to contribute to virulence. We previously reported that P. gingivalis possessed an Hsp90 homologue (HtpG) which cross-reacts with human Hsp90. In addition, we found that elevated levels of serum antibody to Hsp90 stress protein in individuals colonized with this microorganism were associated with periodontal health. However, the role of HtpG in P. gingivalis has not been explored. Therefore, we cloned the htpG gene and investigated the characteristics of HtpG localization and expression in P. gingivalis. htpG exists as a single gene of 2,052 bp from which a single message encoding a mature protein of approximately 68 kDa is transcribed. Western blot analysis revealed that the 68-kDa polypeptide was stress inducible and that a major band at 44 kDa and a minor band at 40 kDa were present at constitutive levels. Cellular localization studies revealed that the 44- and 40-kDa species were associated with membrane and vesicle fractions, while the 68-kDa polypeptide was localized to the cytosolic fractions.
TI  - Epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  - Accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. In subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gram-negative bacteria increases. As the gingival junctional epithelium (JE) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of LTAs (from Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis) and LPSs (from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (HaCaT and ERM) and a culture model for human JE. The cells were exposed to the LTAs or LPSs (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. None of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the JE cultures. However, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in all cultures treated with LTAs. In contrast, LPSs showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. This suggests that LPSs, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. However, the LTAs appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal JE and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - CD14 employs hydrophilic regions to "capture" lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - CD14 participates in the host innate inflammatory response to bacterial LPS obtained from Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. Evidence from several laboratories suggests that different regions of the amino-terminal portion of the molecule may be involved in LPS binding. In this report a series of single-residue serine replacement and charge reversal mutations were generated to further elucidate the mechanism by which this protein may bind a multitude of different LPS ligands. Single-residue CD14 mutation proteins were examined for their ability to bind LPS obtained from E. coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Helicobacter pylori and facilitate the activation of E-selectin from human endothelial cells. In addition, the single-residue CD14 mutation proteins were employed to perform monoclonal epitope-mapping studies with three LPS-blocking Abs that bound tertiary epitopes. Evidence that several different hydrophilic regions of the amino-terminal region of CD14 are involved in LPS binding was obtained. Epitope-mapping studies revealed that these hydrophilic regions are located on one side of the protein surface. These studies suggest that CD14 employs a charged surface in a manor similar to the macrophage scavenger receptor to "capture" LPS ligands and "present" them to other components of the innate host defense system.
TI  - Prevention of endotoxin-induced lethality in mice by calmodulin kinase activator.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381 lipid A showed lower activity in inducing interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-1beta production and cytokine mRNA expression than synthetic Escherichia coli lipid A (compound 506) in alveolar macrophages of C57BL/6 mice. Both the lipid As induced tumor necrosis factor alpha in alveolar macrophages and IL-6 in peritoneal macrophages. A calmodulin (CaM) antagonist, W-7, inhibited IL-1beta production and its mRNA expression induced by P. gingivalis lipid A but not compound 506 in alveolar macrophages. A CaM kinase activator reduced the induction of IL-1beta in the serum of mice when administered with compound 506, and protected the mice against the lethal toxicity. The modulation of a variety of intracellular enzymes including the CaM kinase may result in clinical control of endotoxic sepsis.
TI  - Acetyl-CoA synthetase from the amitochondriate eukaryote Giardia lamblia belongs  to the newly recognized superfamily of acyl-CoA synthetases (Nucleoside diphosphate-forming).
AB  - The gene coding for the acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming) from the amitochondriate eukaryote Giardia lamblia has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme exhibited the same substrate specificity as the native enzyme, utilizing acetyl-CoA and adenine nucleotides as preferred substrates and less efficiently, propionyl- and succinyl-CoA. N- and C-terminal parts of the G. lamblia acetyl-CoA synthetase sequence were found to be homologous to the alpha- and beta-subunits, respectively, of succinyl-CoA synthetase. Sequence analysis of homologous enzymes from various bacteria, archaea, and the eukaryote, Plasmodium falciparum, identified conserved features in their organization, which allowed us to delineate a new superfamily of acyl-CoA synthetases (nucleoside diphosphate-forming) and its signature motifs. The representatives of this new superfamily of thiokinases vary in their domain arrangement, some consisting of separate alpha- and beta-subunits and others comprising fusion proteins in alpha-beta or beta-alpha orientation. The presence of homologs of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming) in such human pathogens as G. lamblia, Yersinia pestis, Bordetella pertussis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and the malaria agent P. falciparum suggests that they might be used as potential drug targets.
TI  - The molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression of an antigenic determinant from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - A genomic library generated in Escherichia coli was probed with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) LDS28, which reacts with a species-specific cell-surface antigen of Porphyromonas gingivalis. A clone designated pGPR2.1 was shown to express a 46-kDa protein reactive with mAb LDS28, which maps to a 1.7-kb HincII fragment. DNA sequence analysis revealed pGPR2.1 contains a 5653-bp insert with six open reading frames, one of which shows significant DNA homology with the rnhB gene of E. coli. Several subclones of pGPR2.1 were randomly generated in plasmid vector pTTQ18* using restriction enzyme Sau3a. Immunoblotting of subclones demonstrated that the LDS28-reactive antigen was coded for by an open reading frame predicted to specify a protein of 455 amino acids (50 kDa). This open reading frame was designated pgaA (Porphyromonas gingivalis antigen). The predicted amino acid sequence of PgaA contains a putative ABC signature for binding NTPs as well as a predicted transmembrane domain. Minicell labelling of pGPR2.1-encoded proteins and subclone derivatives revealed that pgaA directs expression of protein of multiple molecular weights (31-46 kDa) from its own promoter in E. coli, and that some of these forms may be caused by proteolysis of a 50-kDa precursor which itself shows a reduced apparent molecular weight (46 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
TI  - The association of two recombinant proteinases of a feline strain of Porphyromonas gingivalis with periodontal disease in cats.
AB  - Serum from 40 domestic cats with various grades of periodontal disease was used to probe two recombinant functional proteinases from feline strain VPB 3457 of Porphyromonas gingivalis expressed in E. coli. One recombinant proteinase (VPB 2856) was constructed using polymerase chain reaction and had 91% DNA identity with the prtC collagenase gene of the human type strain of P. gingivalis, while the other proteinase (VPB 2814) was isolated from a size selected genomic library and had an amino-terminal sequence with no significant identity with deposited sequences. Thirteen of 40 cats showed a serum antibody response to VPB 2856 using Western immunoblot detection. All the 13 cats had an overall periodontal grade of 3 or greater and greater than 1.68x10(5) cfu P. gingivalis at the canine and premolar periodontium sample sites. Fourteen of 40 cats showed a serum antibody response to VPB 2814. Thirteen of these 14 cats had an overall periodontal grade of 3 or greater. Regression analysis of overall periodontal grade against the serum antibody response showed significant positive relationships for both VPB 2856 (r2 = 0.351; p<0.001) and VPB 2814 (r2 = 0.247; p<0.001). Regression analysis of the total colony forming units of feline strain P. gingivalis against the grade of serum antibody response showed a positive relationship for both VPB 2856 (r2 = 0.662; p<0.001) and VPB 2814 (r2 = 0.531; p<0.001). These data provide strong evidence that the recombinant proteinases of feline P. gingivalis expressed in E. coli clones VPB 2856 and VPB 2814 are associated with periodontal disease in cats.
TI  - Expression and immunogenicity of hemagglutinin A from Porphyromonas gingivalis in an avirulent Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiologic agent of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease that ultimately results in the loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of avirulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains as antigen delivery systems for protective antigens of pathogens that colonize or cross mucosal surfaces. In this study, we constructed and characterized a recombinant S. enterica serovar Typhimurium avirulent vaccine strain which expresses hemagglutinin A and carries no antibiotic resistance markers. HagA, a major virulence-associated surface protein, is a potentially useful immunogen that contains an antigenic epitope which, in humans, elicits an immune response that is protective against subsequent colonization by P. gingivalis. The hagA gene, including its promoter, was cloned into a balanced-lethal Salmonella vector and transferred to the vaccine strain. Heterologous expression of HagA was demonstrated in both Escherichia coli JM109 and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain chi4072. The HagA epitope was present in its native configuration as determined by immunochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Purified recombinant HagA was recognized by sera from mice immunized with the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain. The HagA-specific antigen of the vaccine was also found to be recognized by serum from a periodontal patient. This vaccine strain, which expresses the functional hemagglutinin protein, induces a humoral immune response against HagA and may be useful for developing a protective vaccine against periodontal diseases associated with P. gingivalis.
TI  - Enzymatic properties of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV produced by the periodontal  pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and its participation in virulence.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen associated with adult periodontitis. We cloned and sequenced the gene (dpp) coding for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPPIV) from P. gingivalis W83, based on the amino acid sequences of peptide fragments derived from purified DPPIV. An Escherichia coli strain overproducing P. gingivalis DPPIV was constructed. The enzymatic properties of recombinant DPPIV purified from the overproducer were similar to those of DPPIV isolated from P. gingivalis. The three amino acid residues Ser, Asp, and His, which are thought to form a catalytic triad in the C-terminal catalytic domain of eukaryotic DPPIV, are conserved in P. gingivalis DPPIV. When each of the corresponding residues of the enzyme was substituted with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis, DPPIV activity significantly decreased, suggesting that these three residues of P. gingivalis DPPIV are involved in the catalytic reaction. DPPIV-deficient mutants of P. gingivalis were constructed and subjected to animal experiments. Mice injected with the wild-type strain developed abscesses to a greater extent and died more frequently than those challenged with mutant strains. Mice injected with the mutants exhibited faster recovery from the infection, as assessed by weight gain and the rate of lesion healing. This decreased virulence of mutants compared with the parent strain suggests that DPPIV is a potential virulence factor of P. gingivalis and may play important roles in the pathogenesis of adult periodontitis induced by the organism.
TI  - Identification and cloning of genes from Porphyromonas gingivalis after mutagenesis with a modified Tn4400 transposon from Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative, black-pigmented, oral anaerobe strongly associated with adult periodontitis. Previous transposon mutagenesis studies with this organism were based on the Bacteroides transposon Tn4351. Characterization of Tn4351-disrupted genes by cloning has not been an efficient way to analyze large numbers of mutants and is further complicated by the high rate of cointegration of the suicide delivery vector containing Tn4351. In this study, we mutagenized P. gingivalis with a modified version of the Bacteroides fragilis transposon Tn4400. Plasmid pYT646B carrying the transposon was mobilized from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 by conjugation. Both normal and inverse transposition frequencies were similar (3 x 10(-8)). However, the inverse transposon (Tn4400') contains a pBR322 replicon and a beta-lactamase gene; thus, the cloning of disrupted genomic DNAs from inverse transposition mutants was easily accomplished after ligation of genomic fragments and transformation into E. coli. Thousands of transconjugants could be obtained in a single mating experiment, and inverse transposition was random as demonstrated by Southern hybridization. By this procedure the disrupted genes from P. gingivalis pleiotropic mutants were quickly cloned, sequenced, and identified.
TI  - Possible potentiation of toxins from Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Porphyromonas gingivalis by cotinine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is a recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of periodontitis. However, the mechanism by which smoking induces its negative effects on the periodontium is not clear. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that synergy may occur between cotinine and bacterial products isolated from 3 putative periodontopathogens. METHODS: A chick embryo toxin assay was used to investigate bacterial toxins (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell-free cell lysates) from 5 species with and without cotinine. A total of 9 putative periodontopathogens (3 species) and 2 non-oral controls (2 species) were studied. The periodontal species were: Prevotella intermedia (n = 4), Prevotella nigrescens (n = 4), and Porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1). The control species tested were: Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1) and Escherichia coli (n = 1). RESULTS: The toxicity kill was significantly greater than expected by simple addition alone (P <0.05, Fisher's exact test) between cotinine (800 ng/ml) and 1) the cell-free extracellular toxins of P. nigrescens MH1 and 2) the cell-free cell lysates of P. intermedia MH2. Synergy occurred with cotinine plus the cell-free extracellular toxins in all but 3 periodontal isolates, and the cell-free cell lysates in all but 2 periodontal isolates. Cotinine significantly (P <0.05, Fisher's exact test) enhanced the effects of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates from one control species (E. coli), but not the other (S. aureus). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that synergy in an in vitro assay can occur between cotinine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens. This may be one important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontitis.
TI  - Increase of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV expression on human gingival fibroblasts upon stimulation with cytokines and bacterial components.
AB  - CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a cell surface ectoenzyme which participates in immune and inflammatory reactions. We found that CD26 was only partially expressed on human fibroblasts from periodontal tissues, whereas fibroblasts from lung and skin expressed CD26 constitutively as revealed by flow cytometry. We examined the possible upregulation of CD26 expression on human gingival fibroblasts in response to various stimulants. Interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha); tumor necrosis factor alpha; gamma interferon; lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Escherichia coli; and Prevotella glycoprotein augmented CD26 expression on gingival fibroblasts. Among the stimulants, IL-1alpha exhibited the most potent activity. Enzymatic activity of CD26 induced by IL-1alpha on fibroblasts was determined colorimetrically in terms of Gly-Pro hydrolysis of a synthetic chromogenic substrate, Gly-Pro p-nitroanilide. Among various inhibitors tested, diprotin A and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited the enzymatic activity, suggesting that the enzyme induced by IL-1alpha was DPPIV. The upregulation of CD26 mRNA expression upon stimulation with IL-1alpha was also revealed by a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay. In the kinetic experiment, 48 h and several days were required for maximum CD26 mRNA accumulation and CD26 molecule expression on the cell surface, respectively. The addition of cycloheximide at 2 h before IL-1alpha stimulation almost completely inhibited the accumulation of CD26 mRNA. These results suggested that induction of CD26 on human gingival fibroblasts is regulated at the transcriptional level and is also dependent on a de novo-synthesized protein factor(s).
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Host responses to recombinant hemagglutinin B of Porphyromonas gingivalis in an experimental rat model.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative, black-pigmented anaerobe, is among the microorganisms implicated in the etiology of adult periodontal disease. This bacterium possesses a number of factors, including hemagglutinins, of potential importance in virulence. Several hemagglutinin genes have been identified, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purpose of this study was to characterize host responses to purified recombinant hemagglutinin B (rHag B), using the conventional Fischer rat as the experimental animal model. The effectiveness of immunization with rHag B on protection against experimental periodontal bone loss following infection with P. gingivalis was also evaluated. Groups of rats were immunized by the subcutaneous route with rHag B in complete Freund's adjuvant, immunized with rHag B and orally infected with P. gingivalis, nonimmunized and noninfected, or orally infected with P. gingivalis only. Serum and saliva samples were collected throughout the experiment and evaluated for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM and salivary IgA antibody activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No salivary IgA anti-Hag B activity was detected in the various groups of rats. A slight serum IgM response similar to that seen in preimmune samples was observed. Serum IgG antibody activity to Hag B was detected only in samples from rats immunized with rHag B. This response was primarily of the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses, followed by IgG2b and low levels of IgG2c. Supernatants from rHag B-stimulated splenic lymphoid cell cultures from immunized rats contained high levels of gamma interferon, followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10, and then IL-4. These results are consistent with the induction of T helper type 1 (Th1)- and Th2-like responses. Western blot analysis of sera derived from rHag B-immunized rats reacted with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitates of P. gingivalis 33277, 381, A7A1-28, and W50, revealing a 50-kDa band reflective of Hag B. However, sera derived from rats immunized with P. gingivalis whole cells or from rats infected with P. gingivalis only did not react with rHag B but did react with TCA precipitates of P. gingivalis strains. Finally, radiographic measurements of periodontal bone loss indicated that rats immunized with rHag B had less bone loss than those infected with P. gingivalis only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of purified rHag B in inducing a protective immune response and support the potential usefulness of this component of P. gingivalis in the development of a vaccine against adult periodontitis.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide delays human polymorphonuclear leukocyte apoptosis in vitro.
AB  - Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a mechanism by which superfluous or damaged  cells undergo changes that lead to selective removal from organ systems by phagocytic cells. Certain bacterial products delay apoptosis in neutrophils (PMNs). In this study, PMNs were incubated for up to 8 h with varying concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipid A or capsular polysaccharide isolated from 3 strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) (strains HG-184, A7A1-28 and 381). Assay runs included controls containing cells and medium but no bacterial products. Fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate apoptotic changes. PMNs exhibited a time-dependent increase in the number of apoptotic cells. When cells were cultured in the presence of LPS from any of the 3 Pg strains, apoptosis was delayed in a dose-dependent fashion (p < 0.05). The effects of these LPS preparations were similar to each other and to Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS. Lipid A from the 3 Pg strains also delayed apoptosis (p < 0.05), but was less potent than LPS or synthetic lipid A. Capsular polysaccharide had no significant effect on apoptosis (p > 0.05). Thus, LPS and lipid A from P. gingivalis appear to modulate the functional lifespan of PMNs. This could potentiate the inflammatory and destructive components of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Soluble CD14-dependent intercellular adhesion molecular-1 induction by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is involved in the accumulation and activation of leukocytes in inflammatory sites through binding to beta2 integrins expressed on leukocytes. We investigated whether or not lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from the periodontopathic bacterium Porphyromonas gingiualis affects ICAM-1 expression on human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). CD14 is a receptor for LPS on monocytes and macrophages and is also present in serum as a soluble protein. We further examined the effects of serum and soluble CD14 (sCD14) on ICAM-1 expression in HGF stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS. METHODS: HGF were prepared from explants of human gingival tissues and incubated in 96-well culture plates before LPS stimulation. LPS derived from Escherichia coli O55:B5 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 LPS were employed. sCD14 was purified from normal human serum (NHS) by affinity chromatography using an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody. ICAM-1 expression on HGF was measured by a cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: P. gingivalis LPS induced ICAM-1 on HGF in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of either 10% fetal calf serum or 2% NHS. The ability of P. gingivalis LPS to induce ICAM-1 was comparable to that of LPS from E. coli at high LPS concentrations. In the absence of NHS, ICAM-1 induction was negligible in HGF stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, reaching a maximum at 2% NHS. The ICAM-1 expression induced by P. gingivalis LPS was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to CD14. Supplementation of serum-free medium with sCD14 alone restored the capacity of HGF to respond to P. gingivalis LPS. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that P. gingivalis LPS induces ICAM-1 expression in HGF in an sCD14-dependent manner. The overexpression of ICAM-1 on fibroblasts in gingiva induced by P. gingivalis LPS seems to be involved in the retention of inflammatory cells in periodontitis lesions.
TI  - Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor activities partially account for calvarial bone resorption induced by local injection of lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and/or interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity mediates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone resorption in vivo. To test this hypothesis, Escherichia coli LPS or Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS was injected into the subcutaneous tissues overlying mouse calvariae. Histological sections, prepared from the center of the lesion, were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and histomorphometric analysis was performed to quantify the osteoclast number and the area of bone resorption. In time course experiments using normal mice, a peak of bone resorption occurred 5 days after endotoxin stimulation. In dose-response experiments, IL-1 receptor type 1 deletion (IL-1R(-/-)), TNF double-receptor p55/p75 deletion (TNF p55(-/-)/p75(-/-)), combined TNF p55 and IL-1 receptor type 1 deletion (TNF p55(-/-)/IL-1R(-/-)), and IL-1beta-converting enzyme-deficient (ICE(-/-)) mice and the respective wild-type mice were injected with 500, 100, or 20 micrograms of P. gingivalis LPS and sacrificed 5 days after LPS injection. At the highest dose (500 micrograms), significant decreases in osteoclast number occurred in mutant mice compared to wild-type mice: (i) a 64% reduction for the TNF p55(-/-)/IL-1R(-/-) mice, (ii) a 57% reduction for the IL-1R(-/-) mice, (iii) a 41% reduction for the TNF p55(-/-)/p75(-/-) mice, and (iv) a 38% reduction for the ICE(-/-) mice. At the two lower doses, bone resorption was apparent but no significant differences between mutant and wild-type animals were observed. The present data indicate that at higher doses, LPS-induced bone resorption is substantially mediated by IL-1 and TNF receptor signaling. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor signaling appears to be slightly more important than TNF receptor signaling. At lower LPS doses, other pathways leading to osteoclast activity that are independent of TNF and IL-1 are involved.
TI  - Variable carbohydrate modifications to the catalytic chains of the RgpA and RgpB  proteases of Porphyromonas gingivalis W50.
AB  - Proteases of Porphyromonas gingivalis are considered to be important virulence determinants of this periodontal bacterium. Several biochemical isoforms of arginine-specific proteases are derived from rgpA and rgpB. HRgpA is a heterodimer composed of the catalytic alpha chain noncovalently associated with a beta adhesin chain derived from the C terminus of the initial full-length translation product. The catalytic alpha chain is also present as a monomer (RgpA) either free in solution or associated with membranes. rgpB lacks the coding region for the adhesin domain present in rgpA and yields only monomeric forms (RgpB) which again may be soluble or membrane associated. In this study, the catalytic chains of this unusual group of enzymes are shown to be differentially modified by the posttranslational addition of carbohydrate. A monoclonal antibody (MAb 1B5) raised to the monomeric RgpA did not react with the corresponding recombinant RgpA alpha chain expressed in Escherichia coli but was immunoreactive with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. MAb 1B5 also reacted with the membrane-associated forms of RgpA and RgpB but not with the heterodimeric HRgpA and the soluble form of RgpB. RgpA treated with denaturants was capable of binding to MAb 1B5 whereas treatment with periodate abolished this binding, suggesting the presence of carbohydrate residues within the epitope. Chemical deglycosylation abolished immunoreactivity with MAb 1B5 and caused a approximately 30% reduction in the size of the membrane-associated enzymes. Monosaccharide analysis of HRgpA and RgpA demonstrated 2.1 and 14.4%, respectively, carbohydrate by weight of protein. Furthermore, distinct differences were detected in their monosaccharide compositions, indicating that these protease isoforms are modified not only to different extents but also with different sugars. The variable nature of these additions may have a significant effect on the structure, stability, and immune recognition of these protease glycoproteins.
TI  - Genetic structure and transcriptional analysis of a mobilizable, antibiotic resistance transposon from Bacteroides.
AB  - Tn4555 is a 12.1-kb Bacteroides antibiotic resistance transposon representative of a novel class of transmissible genetic elements that can be transferred by resident conjugative tetracycline resistance transposons (Tc(r)-elements) but are not capable of self-transfer. Previously it was shown that Tn4555 transposes by a site-specific recombination mechanism that utilizes a circular intermediate. This circular form is induced by tetracycline and it also is the substrate for conjugation. To better understand the mechanism of transposition, the entire nucleotide sequence of Tn4555 was determined and a set of genes potentially involved in transposition was identified. The transposon was 12,105 bp including a variable 6-bp coupling sequence associated with one of the transposon termini. The element had a 44.3% G + C composition and nine potential protein coding regions were observed, eight of which were encoded on the forward strand. Two putative transposition genes were found. The int gene product had significant C-terminal homology to the lambda family of integrases and the xis gene product was similar to several excisionase proteins encoded by both plasmids and conjugative transposons. The mobA mobilization gene and cfxA beta-lactamase gene of Tn4555 had been previously identified, and the remaining five open reading frames had no significant matches with sequences in the available databases. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that all Tn4555 genes except for orf-9 were expressed and two sets of genes, tnpA, int and xis, orf-5, orf-6 were organized in operons. None of the genes seemed to be induced significantly by the addition of tetracycline to cultures. Although a small 0.4-kb xis-specific transcript appeared in tetracycline-treated cultures it was not clear if this was due to an induction or if it was a specific degradation product.
TI  - Construction and immunologic evaluation of a Porphyromonas gingivalis subsequence peptide fused to hepatitis B virus core antigen.
AB  - Several proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis contain multiple copies of a 47 amino acid conserved repeated sequence. A fusion protein was constructed in which the P. gingivalis peptide was fused to the carboxy terminus of the hepatitis B core protein. This fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to vaccinate mice that were later challenged with P. gingivalis W83 using the mouse abscess model. Although the mice were not protected against bacterial challenge, Western blot analysis showed that sera from the mice and from rabbits immunized with the fusion protein reacted with a number of vesicle proteins from P. gingivalis W83. These data suggested that this peptide is recognized by the host's immune system but that the antibodies are not protective.
TI  - Endotoxin affinity for orthodontic brackets.
AB  - Endotoxin, cell envelope lipopolysaccharide produced by gram-negative bacteria can activate an immune response through a variety of pathways. In addition, it can stimulate bone resorption and reduce the periodontal tissue's healing capacity. Previous studies have documented the affinity of lipopolysaccharide for restorative materials. This study evaluated the affinity of lipopolysaccharide for commercially available orthodontic brackets. Stainless steel, ceramic, plastic, and "gold" brackets were exposed to 10 EU/mm2radiolabeled Porphyromonas gingivalis or Escherichia coli lipolpoysaccharide in water and incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Brackets were then transferred to fresh lipopolysaccharide-free water and incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C to evaluate elution. This elution transfer was continued up to 96 hours total incubation. Lipopolysaccharide adherence and elution levels were calculated after treatment, and elution solutions were evaluated through liquid scintillation spectrometry. Mean initial lipopolysaccharide adherence ranged from 2.42 +/- 0.26 EU/mm2(E. coli, plastic) to 6.75 +/- 0.34 EU/mm2 (P. gingivalis, stainless steel). P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide adherence was significantly greater than E. coli lipopolysaccharide adherence for all bracket types. Moreover, for each lipopolysaccharide type, stainless steel brackets exhibited significantly greater lipopolysaccharide adherence. Regarding elution, only the P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-exposed ceramic and plastic brackets at 24 hours and the stainless steel and ceramic brackets at 48 hours eluted measurable lipopolysaccharide. Results from this study demonstrate that P. gingivalis and E. coli LPS exhibit a high affinity for orthodontic brackets. In vivo, this affinity could affect the concentration of LPS in the gingival sulcus, thereby contributing to inflammation in tissues adjacent to the brackets.
TI  - Modulation of major histocompatibility complex protein expression by human gamma  interferon mediated by cysteine proteinase-adhesin polyproteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Cysteine proteinases have been emphasized in the virulence of Porphyromonas gingivalis in chronic periodontitis. These hydrolases may promote the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and disrupt components of the immune system. In this study it was shown that purified Arg-gingipain and Lys-gingipain inhibited expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in response to the stimulation of endothelial cells with human gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Treatment with the cysteine proteinases resulted in a rapid shift in the apparent molecular size of IFN-gamma from 17 to 15 kDa, as shown by Western blot analysis, a response which also occurred in the presence of serum. Further, glycosylated natural IFN-gamma from human leukocytes and unglycosylated recombinant IFN-gamma from Escherichia coli were both digested by the cysteine proteinases. Immunoblot analysis indicated that cleavage within the carboxyl terminus of recombinant IFN-gamma correlated with the loss of induction of MHC class II expression as monitored by analytical flow cytometry. No hydrolysis of MHC class II molecules or human IFN-gamma receptor by these proteinases was detected by Western blot analysis. These findings suggest that P. gingivalis cysteine proteinases may alter the cytokine network at the point of infection through the cleavage of IFN-gamma. Degradation of IFN-gamma could have important consequences for the recruitment and activation of leukocytes and therefore may contribute significantly to the destruction of the periodontal attachment.
TI  - Autoregulatory effect of interleukin-10 on proinflammatory cytokine production by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-tolerant human monocytes.
AB  - Pretreatment of human peripheral blood monocytes with a very low concentration (0.1 ng/ml) of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (LPS) resulted in a significant decrease of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, but not IL-8 production, by restimulation of a high concentration (1 microg/ml) of the same LPS. In contrast, the same pretreatment with Escherichia coli LPS resulted in the enhanced production of both IL-6 and IL-8 after restimulation. The selective induction by P. gingivalis LPS tolerance of IL-6 production developed in a time-dependent manner during the primary culture. P. gingivalis LPS-pretreated cells were also refractory to a high-dose E. coli LPS restimulation in terms of IL-6 production. The expression of IL-6 mRNA decreased 10 h after restimulation of P. gingivalis LPS-pretreated monocytes. Furthermore, an up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 upon a second high-dose LPS rechallenge occurred at the same time point in the pretreated cells. We studied the role of IL-10 in the process of IL-6 down-regulation. Neutralization by an anti-IL-10 polyclonal antibody prevented IL-6 down-regulation in P. gingivalis LPS-pretreated monocytes, whereas IL-8 production was not affected. Addition of exogenous IL-10 during the high-dose LPS stimulation of untreated cells substituted for the LPS pretreatment and resulted in the inhibition of IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner. A higher dose of IL-10 was required to suppress IL-8 synthesis from monocytes. Our data suggest that IL-10 mediates IL-6 down-regulation in P. gingivalis LPS-tolerant monocytes in an autocrine manner.
TI  - Interleukin (IL)-1 and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide stimulation of IL-6 production by fibroblasts derived from healthy or periodontally diseased human gingival tissue.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) play a key role in tissue repair and destruction. These cells express low levels of interleukin (IL)-6 constitutively and increased levels after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). However, little information is available on IL-6 production by fibroblasts derived from diseased tissue. The present study compared constitutive and induced IL-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) derived from healthy and diseased periodontal tissue. We also evaluated whether IL-1 acted in a synergistic manner with LPS in inducing IL-6 production by HGF and whether LPS acted via CD14. METHODS: HGF derived from healthy and diseased tissue and foreskin fibroblasts were grown to confluency, photographed, and counted, and their constitutive IL-6 production was quantitated by ELISA. Healthy and diseased HGF were also pretreated with IL-1alpha, followed by incubation with Porphyromonas gingivalis or Escherichia coli LPS. Culture supernatants were assessed for IL-6 protein by ELISA and cell lysates for mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In order to determine if LPS stimulation was mediated through the LPS receptor, CD14, surface receptors on HGF were assessed by flow cytometry and the total RNA CD14 mRNA was assessed. RESULTS: Higher quantities of IL-6 were produced by the diseased HGF before and after stimulation than by the healthy HGF. Pretreatment with IL-1alpha followed by LPS stimulation of the healthy and diseased HGF cell lines resulted in an additive effect on IL-6 production. Pretreatment with IL-1alpha followed by a second incubation with the same stimulant produced higher amounts of IL-6 than cultures incubated with LPS alone or following IL-1alpha pretreatment. Similar amounts of IL-6 mRNA were present in unstimulated HGF from either diseased or healthy tissue and in those incubated with IL-1alpha only. After incubation with IL-1alpha and LPS, diseased HGF produced slightly more mRNA than healthy HGF. CD14 was not expressed by healthy or diseased HGF even after stimulation with either P. gingivalis or E. coli LPS. CD14 message was also undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate heterogeneity among gingival fibroblasts and an additive effect of IL-1 and P. gingivalis LPS on IL-6 production by HGF. Furthermore, the LPS effect on HGF was not mediated by CD14.
TI  - Induction of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - We examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte autoantibody (ATA) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from periodontopathic bacteria; Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral Escherichia coli. All of the LPS induced IgM-ATA. Among these, LPS from C. ochracea induced the highest level of IgM-ATA, whereas that of P. gingivalis induced the lowest. The peritoneal T lymphocytes of mice injected with LPS were bound by IgM-ATA. Peritoneal B-1 (CD5+B) cells stimulated by each LPS produced much more IgM-ATA than splenic B-2 (CD5-B) cells, suggesting that B-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. Serum of mice injected with C. ochracea and F. nucleatum LPS showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. Binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by IgM purified from serum of the mice injected with C. ochracea LPS. Furthermore, serum of mice treated with C. ochracea, F. nucleatum or A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. However, purified IgM from the serum of mice treated with C. ochracea LPS failed to produce the same inhibition. Our results suggest that LPS from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce IgM-ATA in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.
TI  - Induction of prostaglandin release from macrophages by bacterial endotoxin.
AB  - This review summarizes the role of the monocytic responses to lipopolysaccharide  as it relates to periodontal disease severity. Data are presented which illustrate that the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secreted by systemic peripheral blood monocytes in culture, in the presence of bacterial endotoxins, are highly correlated with the levels observed in the gingival crevicular fluid. Furthermore, the different periodontal diagnostic categories have varying levels of monocytic and crevicular fluid PGE2, in juxtaposition with clinical disease severity. These data are consistent with the concept that there is close synchrony between the systemic responsiveness of peripheral blood monocytes with regard to prostanoid synthesis and the local levels of mediator present within the gingival crevice.
TI  - Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide interactions with CD14: implications for myeloid and nonmyeloid cell activation.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative bacterium, is an etiologic agent for adult periodontitis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released from this bacterium can react with numerous host cell types. P. gingivalis LPS stimulates tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta secretion from monocytes (myeloid) but does not elicit E-selectin expression from human endothelial cells (nonmyeloid). In contrast, Escherichia coli LPS facilitates expression of these inflammatory mediators through CD14-dependent pathways on both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells. LPS binding studies have revealed that although P. gingivalis and E. coli LPSs bind to CD14 differently, this fact does not adequately explain the lack of endothelial cell activation by P. gingivalis LPS. Rather, LPS binding site and blocking monoclonal antibody epitope mapping studies have suggested that CD14 presents a charged surface that captures different microbial ligands by electrostatic interactions. We propose that human endothelial cells do not respond to P. gingivalis LPS because of their inability to "recognize" CD14-P. gingivalis LPS complexes.
TI  - A novel dnaK operon from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the dnaK operon cloned from Porphyromonas gingivalis revealed that the operon does not contain homologues of either dnaJ or grpE. However, there were two genes which encode small heat shock proteins immediately downstream from the dnaK and they were transcribed together with dnaK as one unit. The ATPase activity of the P. gingivalis DnaK was synergistically stimulated up to 40-fold in the simultaneous presence of Escherichia coli DnaJ and GrpE. These results suggest that the DnaK homologue of P. gingivalis, with its unique genetic structure and evolutionary features, works as a member of the DnaK chaperone system.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Identification and characterization of IS2404 and IS2606: two distinct repeated sequences for detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans by PCR.
AB  - Molecular analysis of Mycobacterium ulcerans has revealed two new insertion sequences (ISs), IS2404 and IS2606. IS2404 was identified by complete sequencing of a previously described repetitive DNA segment from M. ulcerans. This element is 1,274 bp long, contains 12-bp inverted repeats and a single open reading frame (ORF) potentially encoding a protein of 327 amino acids (aa), and apparently generates 7-bp direct repeats upon transposition. Amino acid similarity was found between the putative transposase and those encoded by ISs in other bacterial sequences from Aeromonas salmonicida (AsIs1), Escherichia coli (H repeat element), Vibrio cholerae (VcIS1), and Porphyromonas gingivalis (PGIS2). The second IS, IS2606, was discovered by sequence analysis of a HaeIII fragment of M. ulcerans genomic DNA containing a repetitive sequence. This element is 1,404 bp long, with 12-bp inverted repeats and a single ORF potentially encoding a protein of 445 aa. Database searches revealed a high degree of amino acid identity (70%) with the putative transposase of IS1554 from M. tuberculosis. Significant amino acid identity (40%) was also observed with transposases from several other microorganisms, including Rhizobium meliloti (ISRm3), Burkholderia cepacia (IS1356), Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Yersinia pestis. PCR screening of DNA from 45 other species of mycobacteria with primers for IS2404 confirm that this element is found only in M. ulcerans. However, by PCR, IS2606 was also found in Mycobacterium lentiflavum, another slow-growing member of the genus Mycobacterium that is apparently genetically distinct from M. ulcerans. Testing the sensitivity of PCR based on IS2404 and IS2606 primers demonstrated the ability to detect 0.1 and 1 M. ulcerans genome equivalents, respectively. The ability to detect small numbers of cells by using two gene targets will be particularly useful for analyzing environmental samples, where there may be low concentrations of M. ulcerans among large numbers of other environmental mycobacteria.
TI  - Tn4351-generated non-haemolytic and/or non-pigmented mutants of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Escherichia coli-Porphyromonas gingivalis plasmid-shuttle vectors R751::* omega 4, pVOH1, and pVAL-1 were used for isolation of non-pigmented, defective protease, or non-haemolytic activity phenotypes in P. gingivalis. Transfer frequencies for R751::* omega 4, pVOH1, and pVAL-1 varied from 1.7 x 10(-9) to 5.3 x 10(-11) depending on the P. gingivalis 381 and ATCC 33277 strains. Two erythromycin-resistant transconjugants were screened from P. gingivalis 381 and eighteen were screened from ATCC 33277. Among isolated transconjugants, two from ATCC 33277 contained only one transposon insertion, while others included both Tn4351 and R751 sequences. The one transconjugant which contained a single insertion of Tn4351, designated NUM-T14, demonstrated defective pigmentation, and defective protease and haemolytic activities. The other transconjugant, designated NUM-T29, demonstrated defective haemolytic activity, but had black pigmentation and protease activity. Cell surface protein analysis by SDS-PAGE indicated that 40 and 18 kD proteins were lost or reduced and that 45 and 36 kD proteins were made to appear in both NUM-T14 and NUM-T29 transconjugants.
TI  - Activities of the Porphyromonas gingivalis PrtP proteinase determined by construction of prtP-deficient mutants and expression of the gene in Bacteroides species.
AB  - PrtP is a major cysteine proteinase of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The gene encoding this proteinase, prtP, was cloned into the Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vectors pFD288 and pFD340 and was expressed in Bacteroides cells, apparently under the control of its own promoter, when in pFD288, or a Bacteroides promoter present on pFD340. Proteolytically active PrtP was detected by fibrinogen zymography in cells or spent growth medium of several Bacteroides species harboring the recombinant plasmids. The proteinase was recovered from Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285(pFD340-prtP) cells by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) extraction and characterized with regard to exopeptidase specificity and sensitivity to proteinase inhibitors. Lys-amidolytic activity, but not Arg-amidolytic activity, was detected. PrtP was activated by cysteine and, to a lesser extent, dithiothreitol, and it was stimulated by glycine-containing compounds. It also was inhibited by Nalpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and, to a lesser extent, H-D-Tyr-L-Pro-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (YPRCK) and was relatively insensitive to EDTA and leupeptin. Neither B. fragilis ATCC 25285(pFD340-prtP) cells nor the CHAPS extract effected hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells or collagen cleavage, but the cells did cleave gelatin. Furthermore, P. gingivalis W12, ATCC 33277, KDP110, and HG66 with knockout mutations in prtP were constructed by allelic replacement. Unlike the parent strains, the mutant strains produced beige colonies on plates containing sheep blood. These strains also were affected in their ability to effect hemagglutination, cleave collagen, and cleave a Lys-specific peptide substrate. This report presents the results of the first characterization of the PrtP proteinase clearly in the absence of any influence by other P. gingivalis proteins and describes the properties of P. gingivalis cells defective in the production of PrtP.
TI  - Inhibition by Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS of apoptosis induction in human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Many factors, such as cytokines and bacterial products, are known to affect the life-span of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). We investigated here whether Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gingivalis) LPS slows down the apoptotic process of PMNs. During incubation in regular culture medium, the viability of PMNs progressively declined, producing apoptotic cells, characterized by chromatin condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage and blebbing of plasma membrane. P.gingivalis LPS significantly increased the viability of PMNs and reduced the production of fragmented DNA, as efficiently as E.coli LPS. The present study suggests that the retardation of PMNs apoptosis by P.gingivalis LPS may modulate the restoration of acute inflammation in the periodontal tissues, where activated PMNs accumulate.
TI  - Differential expression of interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by human gingival epithelial cells in response to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  - Little is known regarding the molecules expressed by gingival epithelial cells that are involved in initiating and maintaining inflammation following the interaction with periodontal pathogens. Thus, we investigated the effect of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis infection on the expression of neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin 8 (IL-8) and the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells. The data revealed that both IL-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression increased after infection with A. actinomycetemcomitans (IL-8: 2- to 7-fold; intercellular adhesion molecule-1: 2.5- to 3.7-fold). IL-8 secretion reached a maximal level 6 h after the infection and the expression subsequently decreased to basal level. The increased cell surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression started at 4 h after infection and reached a maximal level 14 h after the infection. In contrast, the expression of both molecules rapidly decreased 2 h after challenge with P. gingivalis. This opposite influence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis infection on the expression of IL-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells suggests that A. actinomycetemcomitans infection may initiate the recruitment of neutrophils, whereas the P. gingivalis infection may retard this process and therefore demonstrate a distinct perspective of virulence.
TI  - Arg-gingipain acts as a major processing enzyme for various cell surface proteins in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Arg-gingipain (RGP) is an Arg-X-specific cysteine proteinase produced by the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis and has been shown to be a potent virulence factor in progressive periodontal disease (Nakayama, K., Kadowaki, T., Okamoto, K., and Yamamoto, K. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23619-23626). In this study, we provide evidence that RGP acts as a major processing enzyme for various cell surface and secretory proteins in P. gingivalis. Fimbrilin, a major component of fimbriae, remained in the precursor form in the RGP-null mutant. Prefimbrilin expressed in Escherichia coli was converted to the mature fimbrilin in vitro when incubated with purified RGP, but its conversion was suppressed by potent RGP inhibitors. The results were consistent with the electron microscopic observation indicating little or no fimbriation in the RGP-null mutant. The immunogenic 75-kDa cell surface protein was also shown to retain its proform in the RGP-null mutant. In addition, Lys-gingipain (KGP) was found to be abnormally processed in the RGP-null mutant. In contrast, both prefimbrilin and the 75-kDa protein precursor were processed to their respective mature forms in the KGP-null mutant, suggesting that KGP is not involved in the normal processing mechanisms of these proteins. These results suggest that RGP not only acts as a direct virulence factor but also makes a significant contribution as a major processing enzyme to the virulence of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Expression of the tpr protease gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated by peptide nutrients.
AB  - The Tpr protease of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 is a membrane-associated enzyme  capable of hydrolyzing chromogenic substrates for trypsin and bacterial collagenases. A previous study by us indicated that Tpr expression was increased under conditions of nutrient limitation. In the present study, we further characterized expression of the tpr gene using a tpr::lacZ reporter gene construct under a range of nutrient conditions. In P. gingivalis, transcription of tpr was initiated 215 bp upstream of the coding region and regulation of tpr expression was at the level of transcription. Deletion mutations in the tpr upstream region identified the promoter region immediately upstream of the transcription start site, determined by primer extension analysis. Three identical 17-bp direct repeats identified within the 5' end of tpr mRNA were involved in tpr regulation. In an Escherichia coli background, tpr transcription was initiated after an AT-rich region upstream of tpr but not at the P. gingivalis start site. Tpr expression in P. gingivalis was suppressed by the addition of peptide and protein nutrients to a peptide-limited growth medium but was only slightly affected by addition of free amino acids. Low-molecular-weight fractions of brain heart infusion rich in phenylalanine, proline, and alanine had the greatest inhibitory effects on expression of the tpr::lacZ construct. Addition of the dipeptide phenylalanyl-phenylalanine to the growth medium resulted in a 10-fold decrease in tpr expression. This suggests that specific phenylalanine-containing peptides are a major factor controlling Tpr expression. Neither hemin starvation, heat shock, nor pH change had significant effects on Tpr expression.
TI  - Expression of the peptide antibiotic human beta-defensin 1 in cultured gingival epithelial cells and gingival tissue.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-1 (hBD-1) is a member of the family of small cationic antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in several mucosal epithelia. Because human gingival epithelium is a site that is constantly challenged by oral microorganisms, we examined the expression of hBD-1 in human gingival epithelial and fibroblast cell cultures and tissue samples. Cell cultures were challenged with cell wall extracts of Porphyromonas gingivalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or phorbol myristate acetate. hBD-1 mRNA was detected in unstimulated and stimulated cultures by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using several primer sets specific for hBD-1. Gingival epithelial cells, but not gingival fibroblasts, expressed a product of the predicted size for hBD-1 mRNA. The sequence of the PCR product was identical to that of hBD-1. hBD-1 mRNA expression was not significantly modulated by any of the stimulants tested. Human gingival tissues from noninflamed and inflamed sites were also analyzed by RT-PCR. hBD-1 mRNA was expressed in all tissue samples. The relative expression of hBD-1 mRNA was similar in noninflamed and inflamed tissues obtained from each of four patients undergoing treatment for periodontitis. However, the relative expression of hBD-1 mRNA varied in gingival biopsies obtained from 15 different normal individuals, and the relative hBD-1 expression was unrelated to interleukin-8 expression. Our findings show the constitutive expression of hBD-1 mRNA in cultured epithelial cells and gingival tissues but not gingival fibroblasts. These findings suggest that expression of hBD-1 may play a role as part of the innate host defenses in maintaining normal gingival health.
TI  - Hemoglobin-binding protein purified from Porphyromonas gingivalis is identical to lysine-specific cysteine proteinase (Lys-gingipain).
AB  - The functional protein that binds to human hemoglobin (hemoglobin-binding protein; HBP) was purified from Porphyromonas gingivalis cells. The analyses of the amino-terminal sequence and amino acid composition revealed that HBP is identical to lysine-specific cysteine proteinase (51 kDa Lys-gingipain; KGP) of P. gingivalis 381. It is a novel finding that KGP has binding affinity to hemoglobin. The binding activity of HBP was enhanced by acidic or anaerobic conditions. Arg-gingipain, a member of the gingipain family, of P. gingivalis exhibited no ability to bind to hemoglobin. The recombinant protein of KGP (r-KGP) generated in Escherichia coli showed both hemoglobin-binding and proteolytic activities. The treatment of r-KGP by protein disulfide isomerase effectively enhanced binding to hemoglobin, whereas the proteinase activity was decreased. The treated r-KGP significantly inhibited the binding of hemoglobin to the whole cell extracts in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the hemoglobin binding of P. gingivalis is mediated by KGP through active domain(s) distinct from that for proteinase activity.
TI  - Immunostimulatory activity of LT-IIa, a type II heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Certain bacterial molecules potentiate immune responses to parenterally administered antigens. One such molecule that has been intensely investigated is cholera toxin, a type I heat-labile enterotoxin produced by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Immunization with a mixture of a foreign antigen and cholera toxin enhances the immune response to the antigen. Similar adjuvant activity is associated with LT-I, a closely related type I heat-labile enterotoxin produced by Escherichia coli. The adjuvant activities of LT-IIa, a member of the type II heat-labile enterotoxins produced by E. coli, have not been described. LT-IIa and CT differ significantly in amino acid sequence of the B polypeptides and in receptor binding affinity. In this study, rats were subcutaneously immunized with fimbrillin, a protein isolated from the bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, and with fimbrillin in combination with LT-IIa, the prototypical type II enterotoxin. Previous studies documented that fimbrillin administered alone is a poor immunogen. Animals immunized with the mixture of fimbrillin and LT-IIa produced high titers of specific IgG antibody directed against fimbrillin. Anti-fimbrillin antibody titers in sera from animals receiving the combination of LT-IIa + fimbrillin were comparable to those obtained from sera of animals immunized with cholera toxin + fimbrillin. The results of these experiments demonstrate that LT-IIa exhibits an adjuvant activity that is equal to that of cholera toxin. Recombinant methods have been established for producing large amounts of LT-IIa, an advantage that will likely provide an economic impetus to consider incorporating the enterotoxin as an immunostimulatory agent in future vaccines.
TI  - Interleukin-6 in neutrophils from peripheral blood and inflammatory periradicular tissues.
AB  - Periradicular tissue samples were recovered from patients undergoing endodontic surgery. Immunohistochemical procedures were used to identify interleukin-6 (IL-6) present in the neutrophils associated with these lesions. Using specific polyclonal antibody, 15 to 20% of the neutrophils associated with the periradicular tissue lesions were positive for IL-6. IL-6-positive plasma cells and histiocytes were also abundant. Cytokine production by neutrophils from the peripheral blood of nondiseased individuals was also evaluated. The cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and bacterial extracts of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Significant levels of IL-6 were produced by cells stimulated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide B5 (933 pg/ml/10(7) neutrophils) and E. coli lipopolysaccharide B12 (791 pg/ml/10(7) neutrophils) when compared with unstimulated cells (39.31 pg/ml/10(7) cells). There was a dose-dependent increase in IL-6 production when cells were stimulated for 24 h with 6 and 12 micrograms/ml of A. actinomycetemcomitans extract. Less stimulation occurred with P. gingivalis, but it was also dose-dependent. Neutrophils resident in periradicular lesions may, therefore, provide a source of IL-6 in addition to that produced by tissue histiocytes and plasma cells.
TI  - Dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of Treponema denticola.
AB  - Prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by Treponema denticola. The gene, prtP, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (K. Ishihara, T. Miura, H. K. Kuramitsu, and K. Okuda, Infect. Immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). In order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of T. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, K1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtP-inactivated DNA fragment. No chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. In addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of the organism decreased in the mutant. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with Fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. The results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. These results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of T. denticola. The loss of dentilsin activity and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of T. denticola.
TI  - Re-evaluation of the culture condition of polymorphonuclear cells for the study of apoptosis induction.
AB  - The culture conditions of human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the study of apoptosis induction were re-evaluated. The changes in the relative viable cell number of PMNs after tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment were colorimetrically investigated using a cell counting kit. The relative potency of PMNs to produce the superoxide anion (O2-) was measured as the reduction of color intensity by addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD). When the PMNs were cultured in conventional RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), the stimulation effect of TNF on O2- generation by PMNs was observed only for the first 6 hours. When FBS was replaced with human serum, the effect of TNF was maintained for longer incubation periods. Prolonged incubation of PMNs spontaneously produced large DNA fragments, and the extent of DNA fragmentation was relatively smaller in human serum-containing medium. TNF, LPS, hyperthermia or potassium thiocyanate slightly accelerated the production of large DNA fragments, as well as the induction of trace amounts of internucleosomal DNA cleavage in PMNs, which became detectable only after concentration by fractional isopropanol precipitation. The present study suggests the importance of the use of human serum rather than conventional FBS for the study of apoptosis induction in PMNs.
TI  - Activation of transcription factors and IL-8 expression in neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B and AP-1 were examined in neutrophils stimulated with LPS purified from P. gingivalis, a major pathogenic bacteria of periodontitis lesion. Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS enhanced the activity reaching a peak at a concentration of 500 ng/ml in the absence of serum. The NF-kappa B activation stimulated with 10 ng/ml of P. gingivalis LPS was suppressed approximately 44% by treatment of neutrophils with anti-CD14 antibody under the presence of serum. Increase in the steady-state IL-8 mRNA level was concomitantly observed by stimulation of neutrophils with 500 ng/ml of P. gingivalis LPS under the absence of serum. These results indicate that P. gingivalis LPS activates NF-kappa B and AP-1 in both serum-dependent and -independent manners, followed by increased IL-8 transcription in neutrophils, and suggested a role for P. gingivalis LPS in IL-8 synthesis by neutrophils in inflamed gingiva and GCF.
TI  - Inactivation and destruction of conserved Trp159 of Fe-superoxide dismutase from  Porphyromonas gingivalis by hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The superoxide dismutase (SOD) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, an obligate anaerobe, was purified from Escherichia coli (sodA sodB mutant) harboring the P. gingivalis SOD-encoding gene. The purified protein contained both iron and a small amount of manganese. Iron- and manganese-reconstituted SOD, which contained one of these metals exclusively, showed specific activities of 1000 and 1200 U/mg/mol of metals/subunit, respectively. These values were similar to the specific activity of the native enzyme purified from the recombinant E. coli strain. The Fe-reconstituted enzyme was inactivated by 10 mM hydrogen peroxide to about 5% of its original activity after a 15 min incubation at 25 degrees C at pH 7.8, whereas the Mn-reconstituted enzyme showed no inactivation after 80 min. A concomitant increase in absorbance at 320 nm was observed with inactivation of the Fe-reconstituted enzyme. Amino acid analysis of the inactivated Fe-reconstituted enzyme showed a decrease of about 0.7 residues of tryptophan/subunit, a value similar to the iron content of the iron-reconstituted enzyme. Three major peptides of the digests of the purified SOD with lysylendopeptidase were separated by a reverse-phase HPLC monitoring at 280 nm. One of the peptides, corresponding to the residues from Gly149 to Lys176, decreased in the HPLC eluent of the H2O2-inactivated SOD to 20% of the amount measured for native SOD. Since this peptide contains only one tryptophan residue, it was concluded that the decomposed tryptophan residue is Trp159, which is located midway between the third and fourth metal ligands, Asp157 and His161, and is conserved in aligned amino acid sequences of all known Fe-SODs and Mn-SODs. Based on these results, we propose that the differences in hydrogen peroxide sensitivities observed for the Fe-SODs and Mn-SODs may be caused by the difference in the identity of the active site metal in the Fe-SODs and Mn-SODs and a tuning of the properties of the iron center in the Fe-SODs.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of specific antibodies directed to heat shock proteins from periodontopathogenic bacteria and of human origin [corrected].
AB  - This study describes the immunological characterization of two different classes  of heat shock proteins isolated from periodontopathogenic bacteria. Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a 74-kDa protein from Bacteroides forsythus showed a high degree of homology with the DnaK protein from Escherichia coli. However, this heat shock protein from B. forsythus reacted very weakly with a commercial anti-DnaK polyclonal antibody by dot-blotting. GroEL-like proteins isolated from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and B. forsythus showed a high degree of homology of their N-terminal amino acid sequences. In general, polyclonal antibodies raised against each GroEL-like protein showed a high level of cross-reactivity. The cross-reactivity of antibodies to bacterial DnaK-like proteins was much more limited. Our findings suggest that DnaK- and GroEL-like proteins from periodontal pathogens are well conserved and that the GroEL-like proteins resemble each other more closely.
TI  - Construction of a functional single-chain variable fragment antibody against hemagglutinin from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Hemagglutinin is a major glycoprotein of Porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles and likely confers the ability to adsorb and penetrate into host tissue cells. To protect this bacterial invasion, murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) Pg-vc, which inhibited the hemagglutinating activity, was prepared by using P. gingivalis vesicles as an antigen. Western blot analysis revealed that when both MAb Pg-vc and anti-HA-Ag2 antibody raised against the P. gingivalis hemagglutinin adhesin (M. Deslauriers and C. Mouton, Infect. Immun. 60:2791-2799, 1992) were allowed to react with protein blots from P. gingivalis vesicles, a superimposable profile was observed. To obtain a recombinant antibody, cDNAs coding for the variable domains of the L and H chains of MAb Pg-vc were cloned by PCR, and a plasmid specifying a single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) was constructed. Following transformation of Escherichia coli cells, a recombinant ScFv protein was successfully expressed. The immunological properties of this protein were identical to those of the parental murine MAb, specifically recognizing the two proteins (43 and 49 kDa) originating from P. gingivalis vesicles. In addition, the ScFv antibody inhibited the P. gingivalis vesicle-associated hemagglutinating activity. The amino acid sequences deduced from nucleotide sequencing experiments confirmed that variable heavy-chain and variable light-chain regions belonged to VH1 and Vkappa12/13 families, respectively. Since the expression system used in this study can readily provide large quantities of single-chain recombinant antibody, it may be a useful in developing a therapeutic agent for passive immunization in humans.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of transposon-induced mutants of Porphyromonas gingivalis deficient in fimbriation.
AB  - Fimbriae are considered to be an important virulence factor of Porphyromonas gingivalis. In order to identify genes essential for fimbriation, other than fimA which encodes the major subunit protein of fimbriae, transposon mutagenesis and immunological screening techniques were used to isolate fimbria-deficient mutants. R751::*Omega4, a suicide vector that carries Tn4351, was transferred from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis by conjugation. Twenty-two independent fimbria-deficient mutants were identified among the resulting transformants. Southern hybridization analysis with pBlue 4351, a transposon-specific probe, and R751 indicated that 45% of the mutants resulted from single transposon insertions and that the remaining 55% of the mutants resulted from cointegration of R751 sequences. Southern hybridization analysis with pUCBg12.1, a probe for the fimA region, indicated that nine of the mutants contained insertions within the 2.5 kb SacI DNA fragment of P. gingivalis that contains fimA, ORF1 (which encodes a 15 kDa protein), and the C-terminal portion of ORF5 (which encodes a 63 kDa protein). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and further Southern hybridization analysis indicated that the insertion site(s) for all nine of these mutants was within the fimA gene. Southern hybridization analysis also indicated that the remaining thirteen mutants contained insertions somewhere outside the 10 kb fimA region. Analysis by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that insertions for most of the thirteen mutants mapped to a 300 kb NotI fragment and are located at least approximately 200 kb away from fimA. These results identify genetic loci other than fimA, that are required for fimbriation of P. gingivalis. Future cloning and characterization of these genetic loci should be straightforward since they are now marked by antibiotic resistance genes carried by the transposon.
TI  - Haemoglobin receptor protein is intragenically encoded by the cysteine proteinase-encoding genes and the haemagglutinin-encoding gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The obligately anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis produces characteristic black-pigmented colonies on blood agar. It is thought that the black pigmentation is caused by haem accumulation and is related to virulence of the microorganism. P. gingivalis cells expressed a prominent 19 kDa protein when grown on blood agar plates. Analysis of its N-terminal amino acid sequence indicated that the 19 kDa protein was encoded by an internal region (HGP15 domain) of an arginine-specific cysteine proteinase (Arg-gingipain, RGP)-encoding gene (rgp1) and was also present in genes for lysine-specific cysteine proteinases (prtP and kgp) and a haemagglutinin (hagA) of P. gingivalis. The HGP15 domain protein was purified from an HGP15-overproducing Escherichia coli and was found to have the ability to bind to haemoglobin in a pH-dependent manner. The anti-HGP15 antiserum reacted with the 19 kDa haemoglobin-binding protein in the envelope of P. gingivalis. P. gingivalis wild-type strain showed pH-dependent haemoglobin adsorption, whereas its non-pigmented mutants that produced no HGP15-related proteins showed deficiency in haemoglobin adsorption. These results strongly indicate a close relationship among HGP15 production, haemoglobin adsorption and haem accumulation of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Development of a bifunctional xylosidase/arabinosidase gene as a reporter gene for the gram-negative anaerobes Bacteroides and Porphyromonas, and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Members of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas are common inhabitants of the human intestinal and oral microflora, and certain species are capable of causing disease states in humans. Genetic studies of these organisms are important for determining factors involved in the development of such diseases. A reporter gene for transcriptional fusions may prove useful for studies of gene regulation in these organisms. Bacteroides ovatus is a normal inhabitant of the human intestinal tract and is one of the few Bacteroides species capable of degrading xylan, a major component of fiber in the diet. A gene encoding for a bifunctional xylosidase/arabinosidase (XA) enzyme was previously cloned in our laboratory from B. ovatus V975 as part of a xylan-inducible operon. The XA gene was isolated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the E. coli plasmid pBluescript II KS+. The XA gene is under transcriptional regulation in E. coli by the lac promoter, and both activities can be induced with isopropylthio-beta-galactoside (IPTG). The XA gene was subcloned into E. coli/Bacteroides shuttle vectors and introduced by conjugation into different Bacteroides species and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The results of transcriptional fusions in Bacteroides species and E. coli were evaluated. The characteristics of the XA reporter system are the low background or total lack of arabinosidase and xylosidase activities in most Bacteroides species, P. gingivalis, and E. coli, and the ease of enzymatic assays. In addition, bacterial colonies can be screened directly on agar plates by fluorescence with methylumbelliferyl derivatives as substrates for either enzymatic activity.
TI  - Effect of lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokines on interleukin-6 production by healthy human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - Cytokines are hormone-like proteins which mediate and regulate inflammatory and immune responses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory cytokines on regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). The HGF cell lines used in this study, H-CL and F-CL, were established by the explant technique from healthy gingival tissue. Cultured cells were grown to confluency and incubated with various concentrations of LPS from Escherichia coli or Porphyromonas gingivalis or with the recombinant human cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1alpha, or IL-1beta. Culture supernatants were collected at various times and assessed for IL-6 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total RNA was isolated from the harvested cells and used to assess levels of IL-6 mRNA by the RNase protection assay. Both LPS preparations induced IL-6 production (1 to 4 ng of IL-6 per ml) by both HGF cell lines. Although TNF-alpha stimulated IL-6 production by HGF, > 10-fold-larger amounts were induced with IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. Furthermore, the addition of both IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha to cultured cells resulted in approximately 600- to 800-fold-higher levels of IL-6 than seen in control cultures, suggesting that these cytokines synergistically induced IL-6 production by HGF. IL-6 message in cultured cells was upregulated 20-fold by TNF-alpha, 1,000-fold by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and 1,400-fold by IL-1alpha plus TNF-alpha. IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha alone upregulate IL-6 production in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The addition of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha to cultured HGF cells resulted in a synergistic induction of IL-6 after 8 h of incubation and when greater than 10 pg of this combination per ml was used. Our studies show that inflammatory cytokines are hundreds of times more potent than LPS in stimulating IL-6 production by HGF.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of AM-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of AM-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Although AM-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (MIC90s > or =3.13 mg/mL), 76% of the B. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at AM-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/L. AM-1155 was highly active against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90s < or =0.39 mg/L). An in-vivo study using a mixed infection with AM-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible B. fragilis and Escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. AM-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against E. coli. These results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of AM-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. Clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in AM-1155-treated mice. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of AM-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the B. fragilis group and P. bivia should be evaluated further.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of chemically defined lipid A from Helicobacter pylori LPS in comparison with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipid A and Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A (compound 506).
AB  - Helicobacter pylori lipid A, characterised by a glucosamine beta (1-6) disaccharide 1-(2-aminoethyl)phosphate acylated by (R)-3-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and (R)-3-(octadecanoyloxy)octadecanoic acid at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively, exhibited no or very low endotoxic activities, i.e. lethal toxicity in galactosamine-loaded mice, pyrogenicity for rabbits and the activity of the Limulus test compared with Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A (compound 506), which possesses beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate, with two acyloxyacyl groups at the 2'- and 3'-positions and two 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl groups at the 2- and 3-positions. The endotoxic properties of H. pylori lipid A were also a little weaker than those of the low endotoxic lipid A of P. gingivalis, which has 1-phospho beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively. Further, the mitogenic activity of H. pylori lipid A in murine splenic mononuclear cells was also less than those of P. gingivalis lipid A and compound 506. However, H. pylori lipid A induced comparable production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) compared with P. gingivalis lipid A and compound 506. H. pylori lipid A also increased human natural killer cell activity, and strongly agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. However, the lipid As of H. pylori and P. gingivalis showed lower activities in inducing tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production by human PBMC and IL-8 production by human gingival fibroblasts than that of compound 506. The structural feature of H. pylori lipid A may be associated with low endotoxic properties and potent immunobiological activities.
TI  - Serum antibodies to Porphyromonas gingivalis block the prostaglandin E2 response  to lipopolysaccharide by mononuclear cells.
AB  - The ability of rabbit and monkey immune sera to neutralize prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was examined. CD14-dependent LPS activation of PGE2 was examined under assay conditions which allowed the comparison of preimmune and immune sera. Serum obtained from rabbits immunized with formalin-fixed Porphyromonas gingivalis cells dramatically reduced the amount of PGE2 produced in response to LPS obtained from three different strains of P. gingivalis but not that from Escherichia coli or Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, a significant reduction in the mean PGE2 level was observed in the presence of sera from immunized but not control monkeys employed in a vaccine trial. Immune serum samples from five of nine immunized monkeys were able to reduce LPS-induced production of PGE2 by greater than 50% compared to that in the corresponding preimmune sera. Immune monkey serum, similar to immune rabbit serum, blocked PGE2 production in response to P. gingivalis LPS but not E. coli LPS. These data demonstrate that immunization with P. gingivalis whole cells can elicit an antibody response that is able to block the PGE2 response to LPS. Neutralization of LPS-mediated inflammatory mediator production may account in part for the observed suppression of alveolar bone loss in immunized monkeys.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 recA homolog and construction of a recA-deficient mutant.
AB  - Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used in PCR to amplify a region of the recA homolog from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83. The resulting PCR fragment was used as a probe to identify a recombinant lambda DASH phage (L10) carrying the P. gingivalis recA homolog. The recA homolog was localized to a 2.1-kb BamHI fragment. The nucleotide sequence of this 2.1-kb fragment was determined, and a 1.02-kb open reading frame (341 amino acids) was detected. The predicted amino acid sequence was strikingly similar (90% identical residues) to the RecA protein from Bacteroides fragilis. No SOS box, characteristic of LexA-regulated promoters, was found in the 5' upstream region of the P. gingivalis recA homolog. In both methyl methanesulfonate and UV survival experiments the recA homolog from P. gingivalis complemented the recA mutation of Escherichia coli HB101. The cloned P. gingivalis recA gene was insertionally inactivated with the ermF-ermAM antibiotic resistance cassette to create a recA-deficient mutant (FLL33) by allelic exchange. The recA-deficient mutant was significantly more sensitive to UV irradiation than the wild-type strain, W83. W83 and FLL33 showed the same level of virulence in in vivo experiments using a mouse model. These results suggest that the recA gene in P. gingivalis W83 plays the expected role of repairing DNA damage caused by UV irradiation. However, inactivation of this gene did not alter the virulence of P. gingivalis in the mouse model.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis infection of oral epithelium inhibits neutrophil transepithelial migration.
AB  - Periodontal diseases are inflammatory disorders caused by microorganisms of dental plaque that colonize the gingival sulcus and, subsequently, the periodontal pocket. As in other mucosal infections, the host response to plaque bacteria is characterized by an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to the gingival crevice. Neutrophil migration through the epithelial lining of the gingival pocket is thought to be the first line of defense against plaque bacteria. In order to model this phenomenon in vitro, we used the oral epithelial cell line KB and human PMNs in the Transwell system and examined the impact of Porphyromonas gingivalis-epithelial cell interactions on subsequent PMN transepithelial migration. We demonstrate here that P. gingivalis infection of oral epithelial cells failed to trigger transmigration of PMNs. Furthermore, it significantly inhibited neutrophil transmigration actively induced by stimuli such as N-formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and the intestinal pathogen enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The ability of P. gingivalis to block PMN transmigration was strongly positively correlated with the ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells. In addition, P. gingivalis attenuated the production of IL-8 and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 by epithelial cells. The ability of P. gingivalis to block neutrophil migration across an intact epithelial barrier may critically impair the potential of the host to confront the bacterial challenge and thus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the groESL operon from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Transcriptional analysis of the groESL operon from Porphyromonas gingivalis, one  of the obligative anaerobic oral microorganisms implicated in adult periodontitis, was performed. P. gingivalis 381 cultured at 37 degrees C was shifted to 42 degrees C, 45 degrees C or 48 degrees C for 10 mins. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that a band with 2.1-kb (kilo base pair) was observed, and the transcripts increased greatly by heat shock. Primer extension and S1 mapping detected four different 5'-ending sites of the mRNAs at the upstream region of the groES. Three sites out of the four were heat-inducible. There were inverted repeats and a Escherichia coli sigma 32-recognizing consensus sequence in the promoter region of the groESL, which may be relevant to the regulation of transcription of groESL operon in P. gingivalis. Both a heat shock promoter and inverted repeats may be relevant to the transcriptional regulation of the groESL operon in P. gingivalis.
TI  - Effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides on mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - The mononuclear phagocyte plays an important role in the regulation of microbe-induced inflammation, in part through its ability to secrete mediators, particularly cytokines, in response to microorganisms and their products. To evaluate the effects of the microbial flora associated with chronic adult periodontitis on cytokine induction, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis was used to stimulate naive and phorbol ester-primed U937 monocytic cells, as well as elutriated human peripheral blood monocytes. We assessed the effect of this LPS, in comparison to that of LPS from Escherichia coli, on cell proliferation, cytokine induction, and surface expression of the LPS receptor CD14. P. gingivalis LPS stimulated proliferation of U937 cells at concentrations of greater than 1 ng/ml, while E. coli LPS inhibited proliferation. Phorbol myristic acid (PMA)-treated U937 cells and elutriated monocytes responded to E. coli LPS activation by producing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA and protein; however, P. gingivalis LPS induced greater numbers of TNF-alpha mRNA-positive cells and higher (P < 0.05) levels of protein than did E. coli LPS. Both cell types expressed interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) mRNA and protein in response to either LPS treatment. Compared with E. coli LPS, P. gingivalis LPS induced significantly (P < 0.05) higher numbers of IL-1 mRNA-positive U937 cells and elutriated monocytes, as well as production of significantly more (P < 0.05) IL-1 protein by the monocytes. The PMA-treated U937 cells and the monocytes produced high levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist mRNA and protein which were only marginally affected by the LPS preparations. While E. coli LPS induced expression of CD 14 on the surface of PMA-primed U937 cells and monocytes, P. gingivalis LPS exhibited a significantly (P < 0.05) greater ability to enhance receptor levels. Our results indicate that P. gingivalis LPS can activate the mononuclear phagocyte for proliferation, cytokine production, and CD14 expression, providing evidence for the potential of this bacterial component to act as a critical regulatory factor in the chronic inflammatory response associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Construction of a plasmid vector for transformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - A host-vector system for transformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis was constructed using a set (1) strains that can incorporate plasmid DNA by electroporation regardless of its source and (2) stable vector plasmids with a selectable marker. First, restriction-negative mutants were isolated, because P. gingivalis possesses restriction modification systems by which DNA introduced by transformation even from heterologous strains of the same species is excluded. For screening of the mutants, plasmid pE5-2 was employed since it could be transconjugated (mobilized) to P. gingivalis from Escherichia coli and is able to replicate in this species, albeit not stably. pE5-2 DNA prepared from E coli was introduced by electroporation into chemically mutagenized P. gingivalis cells. By this method, three putative restriction-negative clones were selected. These strains exhibited a capacity for electroporation with plasmid DNAs both from E. coli and from various P. gingivalis strains at a similar efficiency. Using one of the derivatives thus obtained, YH522, we then screened for plasmids that could replicate stably in P. gingivalis. Since no plasmids were found from P. gingivalis, cryptic plasmids from other species of black-pigmented oral anaerobic rods were examined for their ability to transform P. gingivalis. A series of plasmids constructed by ligation with pBR322 for replication in E. coli and the EcoRI-B fragment from pBF4 containing erythromycin resistance were prepared from E. coli and were used for electroporation of P. gingivalis. Among these, a recombinant plasmid containing the replicon of pYHBA1 from Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, designated pYH400, was found to be incorporated into the restriction-negative P. gingivalis strain and replicated stably. This set of recipient strains and stable plasmids with a selectable marker constitutes the first practical host-vector system for this species.
TI  - Extracts of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  - In order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as Escherichia coli on bone formation, clone MC3T3-E1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. The addition of the sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. By contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus sanguis, and Escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. The addition of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. Polymyxin B did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kDa eluted from Sephadex G-200 column. The inhibitory substances of Prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate that Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
TI  - Contrasting effects of lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) from oral black-pigmented bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae on platelets, a major source of serotonin, and on histamine-forming enzyme in mice.
AB  - By measurement of serotonin levels, the translocation of platelets to various tissues was examined following intravenous injection of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into C3H/HeN mice. There was a rapid platelet accumulation (within 5 min and particularly in the lung), followed by a slower accumulation in the liver, which reached its plateau 3-5 h later. The severity of the anaphylactoid shock corresponded well with the magnitude of the rapid response. LPSs from the oral black-pigmented bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, were much more potent in inducing the rapid platelet response than were those from the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. However, LPSs from these Enterobacteriaceae were significantly more potent than those from black-pigmented bacteria in inducing the slow platelet response. There was also a contrast between their abilities to induce histidine decarboxylase, which forms histamine from histidine: LPSs from the Enterobacteriaceae were much more potent than those from black-pigmented bacteria.
TI  - Identification of a second endogenous Porphyromonas gingivalis insertion element.
AB  - In this study a second endogenous Porphyromonas gingivalis insertion element (IS  element) that is capable of transposition within P. gingivalis was identified. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Tn4351 insertion site in a P. gingivalis Tn4351-generated transconjugant showed that a complete copy of the previously unidentified IS element, designated PGIS2, had inserted into IS4351R in Tn4351. PGIS2 is 1,207 bp in length with 19-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats, and insertion resulted in a duplicated 10-bp target sequence. Results of Southern hybridization of chromosomal DNA isolated from several P. gingivalis strains with a PGIS2-specific probe demonstrated that the number of copies of PGIS2 per genome varies among different P. gingivalis strains. Computer analysis of the putative polypeptide encoded by PGIS2 revealed strong homologies to the products encoded by IS1358 from Vibrio cholerae, ISAS1 from Aeromonas salmonicida, and H-rpt in Escherichia coli K-12.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Secretion of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. It was recently demonstrated that PMN have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. We therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-8 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) secreted by PMN from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium Escherichia coli. A actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and E. coli LPS stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 than the control unstimulated PMN (p < 0.01). The levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 released from cells stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans or E. coli LPS (p < 0.05). On the other hand, substantially greater amounts of IL-1ra were released from PMN stimulated with each LPS and from control unstimulated PMN during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of IL-1ra were secreted by PMN stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans and E.coli LPS during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). The inhibitory effects of IL-1ra on the biological activity of IL-1 in the supernatants of PMN were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. The supernatants of PMN stimulated with each LPS showed less biological IL-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human IL-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of PMN stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS. These findings demonstrated that LPS from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating PMN to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as IL-1ra. Different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various LPS might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a hemin-regulated gene, hemR, from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - An hemR (hemin-regulated) gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53977 has been  isolated and characterized. This gene is present downstream from the prtT gene, previously cloned in this laboratory. In addition, another putative gene, ORF1, was identified between hemR and prtT. The complete nucleotide sequences of ORF1 and hemR were determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of ORF1 and HemR proteins corresponded to 16- and 48-kDa proteins, respectively. The amino termini of the HemR protein exhibited significant homology with iron-regulated, TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor proteins from various bacteria, while the carboxyl terminus of the HemR protein displayed almost complete identity with a P. gingivalis PrtT protease domain. PCR analyses confirmed the existence of such extensive homology between the carboxyl termini of both the prtT and hemR genes on the P. gingivalis chromosome. Northern blots indicated that ORF1 was part of a 1.0-kb mRNA and was positively regulated by hemin levels. On the other hand, the hemR gene was apparently a part of a 3.0-kb polycistronic message and was negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by hemin. Primer extension analysis of the hemR gene revealed that the transcription start site was at a C residue located within ORF1. An examination of HemR::lacZ constructs in both Escherichia coli and P. gingivalis confirmed hemin repression of hemR expression in both organisms. Moreover, the HemR protein expressed in E. coli was detected by an antiserum from a periodontitis patient heavily colonized with P. gingivalis but not by serum from a periodontally healthy patient or by antisera against hemin-grown P. gingivalis cells. Therefore, it is likely that the 48-kDa HemR protein can be expressed only under hemin-restricted conditions. These results suggest that we have isolated a hemin-regulated gene, hemR, which encodes a 48-kDa protein that may be a TonB-dependent outer membrane protein.
TI  - Comparison of lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Campylobacter and Wolinella spp. by tricine-SDS-PAGE.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of 11 bacterial strains from the type species of the genera Bacteroides (B. fragilis), Prevotella (Pr. melaninogenica), Porphyromonas (Po. gingivalis), Campylobacter (C. fetus subsp. fetus), and Wolinella (W. succinogenes), and from the type strains of B. distasonis, B. forsythus, B. ureolyticus, Po. levii, Po. macacae, and C. gracilis, were extracted with hot water-phenol (Westphal method). S-form LPSs, obtained from all organisms, were well resolved with tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Lipid A was not stained. Also profiles from LPS of Escherichia coli, serotypes 0111:B4 and 055:B5, could be distinguished. While W. succinogenes showed a relatively short S-form LPS on electrophoregrams, the other bacteria, including B. fragilis, exhibited long-ladder LPSs. Po. gingivalis displayed the largest number of bands and the longest O-chain. The long O-chain of this bacterium may be important for its virulence.
TI  - Detection and comparison of specific hemin binding by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - A radioligand assay was designed to detect and compare specific hemin binding by  the periodontal anaerobic black-pigmenting bacteria (BPB) Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The assay included physiological concentrations of the hemin-binding protein rabbit serum albumin (RSA) to prevent self-aggregation and nonspecific interaction of hemin with cellular components. Under these conditions, heme-starved P. intermedia cells (two strains) expressed a single binding site species (4,100 to 4,600 sites/cell) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.0 x 10(-9) M. Heme-starved P. gingivalis cells (two strains) expressed two binding site species; the higher-affinity site (1,000 to 1,500 sites/cell) displayed a Kd of between 3.6 x 10(-11) and 9.6 x 10(-11) M, whereas the estimated Kd of the lower-affinity site (1.9 x 10(5) to 6.3 x 10(5) sites/cell) ranged between 2.6 x 10(-7) and 6.5 x 10(-8) M. Specific binding was greatly diminished in heme-replete cells of either BPB species and was not displayed by iron-replete Escherichia coli cells, which bound as much hemin in the absence of RSA as did P. intermedia. Hemin binding by BPB was reduced following treatment with protein-modifying agents (heat, pronase, and N-bromosuccinimide) and was blocked by protoporphyrin IX and hemoglobin but not by Congo red. Hemopexin also inhibited bacterial hemin binding. These findings indicate that both P. gingivalis and P. intermedia express heme-repressible proteinaceous hemin-binding sites with affinities intermediate between those of serum albumin and hemopexin. P. gingivalis exhibited a 10-fold-greater specific binding affinity and greater heme storage capacity than did P. intermedia, suggesting that the former would be ecologically advantaged with respect to heme acquisition.
TI  - Characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis antigen recognized by a monoclonal antibody which prevents colonization by the organism.
AB  - Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 61BG1.3 prevented recolonization of deep pockets by Porphyromonas gingivalis in patients with periodontitis. The aim of this work was to identify the antigen recognized by the MAb. This was carried out by dose-dependent inhibition with materials extracted from P. gingivalis and assessed by a radioimmunoassay. A protease preparation and a capsular extract inhibited about 95% of the binding activity, whereas LPS or fimbriae had no effect. However, about 125 times greater concentration of the capsular than the protease material was needed to inhibit 50% of the antibody activity, suggesting that the MAb recognizes the protease preparation and that the capsular extract contained some protease. Western blotting of MAb 61BG1.3 with recombinant prpR1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli confirmed that MAb 61BG1.3 recognizes the haemagglutinating protease and mapped its epitope to residues 748-1130 of the beta component of the polyprotein. Three major bands of M(r) 45,000, 38,300 and 31,400 were detected in native whole cells of the virulent P. gingivalis strain W50 by Western blotting with MAb 61BG1.3. The MAb inhibited haemagglutination of human red blood cells by P. gingivalis or by a native protease extract. Blocking adhesion of P. gingivalis to the receptors on erythrocytes might be a mechanism by which the MAb inhibits recolonization by the microorganism.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide affinity for titanium implant biomaterials.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affinity for titanium implant biomaterials could affect crevicular LPS concentrations and thereby influence periimplant inflammation. PURPOSE OF STUDY: The purpose of this study was to evaluate Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli LPS affinity for titanium biomaterials groups that differed in surface oxide composition and surface roughness. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Polished and abraded grade 1 commercially pure titanium and grade 5 alloyed extra low interstitial titanium specimens were treated with 10 EU/mm2 and radiolabeled LPS. RESULTS: The resultant mean +/- SD LPS adherence values ranged from 4.17 +/- 0.29 to 4.79 +/- 0.40 EU/ mm2. No difference in adherence and elution was indicated on the basis of LPS type, surface oxide composition, or surface roughness. Moreover, P. gingivalis and F. coli LPS desorption was below detection. CONCLUSION: Clinically, the high affinity of both LPS types for titanium biomaterials may adversely influence the periimplant tissue response.
TI  - Identification of CD14 residues involved in specific lipopolysaccharide recognition.
AB  - CD14 is a key molecule responsible for the innate host inflammatory response to microbial infection. It is able to bind a wide variety of microbial ligands and facilitate the activation of both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells. However, its specific contribution to the innate recognition of bacteria is not known. Presently there is no information on the contribution of individual CD14 residues to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding or on the molecular basis of the interaction between CD14 and LPS from other bacteria. LPS obtained from Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium associated with chronic inflammatory disease, binds CD14 and activates myeloid cells but does not facilitate the activation of nonmyeloid cells. The transfer and binding of these two LPS species to soluble CD14 recombinant globulin proteins with single point mutations was examined. Functional activity of the mutant proteins was monitored by E-selectin expression on human umbilical cord endothelial cells. The analysis identified a charge reversal mutation in a single residue, E47, that demonstrated selective binding to E. coli LPS but not to P. gingivalis LPS. E-selectin activation assays indicated that proteins with mutations at position E47 maintained their structural integrity. Other mutations, including a charge reversal mutation of residue E58, did not significantly reduce the binding of either LPS ligand or the ability of the molecule to facilitate E-selectin activation. These data demonstrate that CD14 can selectively recognize different LPS ligands.
TI  - Extracts of periodontopathic microorganisms lack functional superantigenic activity for murine T cells.
AB  - Products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. It has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (SAg) activity. SAg bind simultaneously to the V beta chain of T cell receptors and to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of T cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. In order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic T cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old Balb/c (H-2d), C57BL/6 (H-2b) and C3H/HeJ (H-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. Laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. Unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to SEB, Con A and Escherichia coli LPS. Thymocytes responded to Con A and SEB, but not to LPS or to any sonic extract. Spleen cells depleted of B cells by panning responded to SEB and Con A, but not to LPS and showed a reduced response to sonicates. The residual response of B cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-Thy 1.2 + C'. Similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not limiting. These results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine T cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.
TI  - Involvement of calcium in interactions between gingival epithelial cells and Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen can invade primary cultures of gingival epithelial cells. This invasion was significantly inhibited (74-81%) by thapsigargin and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N1,N1-tetraacetic acid, acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM), but not by EDTA or amiloride. Release of Ca2+ from an intracellular store and the subsequent increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] may, therefore, be involved in the invasion process, while Ca2+ influx is not. Moreover, cytosolic [Ca2+] was found to increase transiently in about 30% of gingival epithelial cells acutely exposed to P. gingivalis, but not in unexposed cells, or in cells exposed to noninvasive Escherichia coli. These findings indicate that P. gingivalis invasion of epithelial cells is correlated with activation of [Ca2+]-dependent host cell signaling systems.
TI  - Prostaglandin production via induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the involvement of cyclooxygenase-1(COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in PGE2 production by human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from periodondopathogenic bacteria. LPS were isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) and Eschericia coli (E coli) by the phenol-water procedure. The three LPS preparations produced PCE2 up to 48 h in a time-dependent manner in human gingival fibroblasts. P. gingivalis-LPS was the most potent stimulator of PGE2 production and, to a lesser extent, A actinomycetemcomitans- and E coli-LPS. Treatment of the cells with indomethacin, a non selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor and NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, completely depressed PGE2 production. Treatment of dexamethasone, known to inhibit COX-2 expression, also significantly prevented PGE2 production. Immunohistochemical staining of COX-2 protein demonstrated that expression of COX-2 protein was increased at 24 h after P gingivalis-LPS stimulation, while expression of COX-1 protein was not affected by P. gingivalis-LPS. In order to investigate the regulation of PGE2 production. P. gingivalis-LPS-stimulated cells were treated with herbimycin A and genistein, both inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. Both the inhibitors significantly inhibited PGE2 production. Herbimycin A treatment depressed expression of COX-2 protein. These data suggest that human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with LPS from periodontopathogenic bacteria mainly produce PGE2 not by COX-1, but by COX-2, induction of which may be regulated by tyrosine kinase and that the produced PGE2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Splenic B-cell activation in lipopolysaccharide-non-responsive C3H/HeJ mice by lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) definitely exhibited mitogenic activity in purified B-cells, separated from spleens of LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice and LPS-non-responsive C3H/HeJ mice by using a magnetic cell sorting system. The mitogenic activity induced by P. gingivalis LPS was incompletely inhibited by polymyxin B. P. gingivalis LPS also induced a higher production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in splenic B-cells of C3H/HeN mice as compared with Escherichia coli LPS. Furthermore, P. gingivalis LPS, but not E. coli LPS, induced definite IL-6 production in C3H/HeJ mice. P. gingivalis LPS increased tyrosine, serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins with various major induced bands in splenic B-cells of both C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice. Additionally, radioiodinated P. gingivalis LPS, similarly to E. coli LPS, bound to a 73-kDa protein on C3H/HeJ as well as C3H/HeN B-cells. Thus P. gingivalis LPS may activate B-cells of C3H/HeJ as well as C3H/HeN mice via the LPS-specific binding protein on the cells.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The effect of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of Candida albicans and C. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (BEC) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. The filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the BEC which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for 45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. The BEC with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. Three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of C. albicans to BEC; S. sanguis had no effect. Both S. sanguis and S. salivarius suppressed adhesion of C. krusei to BEC pre-exposed to three different bacterial concentrations, although variable results were obtained with P. gingivalis and E. coli. Significant differences in the relative adhesion of C. albicans and C. krusei to BEC were also recorded. These results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to BEC is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the BEC.
TI  - Helicobacter pylori and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides are poorly transferred to recombinant soluble CD14.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori and Porphyromonas gingivalis are gram-negative bacteria associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. These bacteria possess lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) that are able to activate human monocytes to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha but fail to activate human endothelial cells to express E-selectin. With Escherichia coli LPS, tumor necrosis factor alpha activation requires membrane-bound CD14 and E-selectin expression requires soluble CD14 (sCD14). Therefore, the ability of H. pylori and P. gingivalis LPSs to transfer to and bind sCD14 was examined by using immobilized recombinant sCD14 and human serum or recombinant LPS-binding protein (LBP). H. pylori and P. gingivalis LPSs were transferred to sCD14 when serum or LBP was present. However, the transfer of these LPSs to CD14 in serum was significantly slower than the transfer of E. coli LPS. Quantitation of the transfer rates by Michaelis-Menten kinetics yielded K(m) values of 6 and 0.1 nM for H. pylori and E. coli LPSs, respectively. The amount of P. gingivalis LPS required to obtain half-maximum binding to CD14 was approximately 10-fold greater than the amount of E. coli LPS required. The slower transfer rates displayed by these LPSs can be explained by the poor binding to LBP observed in direct binding assays. These results are consistent with the proportionately lower ability of these LPSs to activate monocytes compared with E. coli LPS. However, the ability of H. pylori and P. gingivalis LPSs to bind LBP and transfer to sCD14 demonstrates that the lack of endothelial cell CD14-dependent cell activation by these LPSs occurs distal to sCD14 binding.
TI  - Host responses induced by co-infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a murine model.
AB  - In this study, evidence is presented that mixed infection with the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans results in a synergistic effect in their pathogenicity and in their ability to induce humoral and cellular host responses. BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously on the back with P. gingivalis ATCC 53977, A. actinomycetemocomitans 75 or a mixture of both bacteria. Samples of blood and fluid from abscesses formed at the site of injection (first degree) or distant from the injection site were collected for microbiologic analysis. Serum and spleens were obtained for evaluation of humoral and cellular responses to P. gingivalis and A actinomycetemocomitans. Mice injected with A. actinomycetemcomitans had first-degree lesions only, whereas mice injected with P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans had lesions at first- and second-degree sites from which both bacterial species were isolated. A serum anti-P. gingivalis response was induced in P. gingivalis-injected mice, which was higher in mice injected with P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. This pattern was not seen in the anti-A, actinomycetemcomitans response. Lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and P. gingivalis of spleen cells from infected mice were decreased, especially following co-infection. Furthermore, co-infection of mice resulted in the greatest decrease in the number of CD5+, especially CD4+ lymphocytes.
TI  - Characterization of an adherence and antigenic determinant of the ArgI protease of Porphyromonas gingivalis which is present on multiple gene products.
AB  - This study was performed to characterize the antigen(s) recognized by a panel of  monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced to be specific for Porphyromonas gingivalis whole cells which we had previously shown to bind to epitopes recognized by sera from periodontitis patients. Preliminary data had suggested that the arginine-specific proteases of P. gingivalis (ArgI, ArgIA, and ArgIB) contained the antigenic determinants of four of these antibodies (MAbs 1A1, 2B/H9, 7D5, and 3B1). The location of the binding sites was examined with purified P. gingivalis enzymes and recombinant regions of the ArgI polyprotein expressed by subclones of the prpR1 gene in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells. All four antibodies were reactive with protein determinants within the beta subunit, a hemagglutinin and/or adhesin component, of the ArgI dimer. MAb 1A1 strongly inhibited the agglutination of human erythrocytes by P. gingivalis W50 culture supernatant, suggesting that the binding site for this antibody contains residues which are critical for the interaction with the erythrocyte surface. The determinant for MAb 1A1 was examined further by construction of a set of truncated forms of the beta component expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase at the N terminus. Analysis of these constructs mapped the binding site for MAb 1A1 to PrpRI residues G-907 to T-931, GVSPKVCKDV TVEGSNEFAP VQNLT. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of P. gingivalis whole-cell proteins demonstrated that MAb 1A1 reacts with several proteins in the Mr range of 20,000 to 120,000. Furthermore, an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the coding sequence for the region of the ArgI beta component containing the MAb 1A1 binding site hybridized to multiple bands on genomic digests of P. gingivalis DNA. These data indicate that the MAb 1A1 epitope may be a component of a binding domain common to multiple gene products of this organism and may thus represent a functionally important target of the host's specific immune response to P. gingivalis in periodontal disease.
TI  - Genetic evidence for the relationship of Porphyromonas gingivalis cysteine protease and hemagglutinin activities.
AB  - Cysteine protease and hemagglutinin activities of Porphyromonas gingivalis have been implicated as virulence factors in periodontitis. In addition, a close structural relationship between these factors has been suggested. In order to examine the molecular basis for such a relationship, we constructed an isogenic mutant, G-102, of P. gingivalis 381 deficient in Arg-gingipain cysteine protease activity. The mutant displayed not only reduced protease activity but also significantly reduced hemagglutination activity compared with the wild-type strain. Therefore, this investigation provided genetic evidence for the recently proposed structural relationship between Arg-gingipain and the hemagglutinin activity of P. gingivalis strains.
TI  - The role of endotoxin and cytokines in the pathogenesis of odontogenic cysts.
AB  - Odontogenic cysts arise from tooth-forming epithelial residues. The stimulus for  the formation of radicular cysts is thought to be endotoxin released from the infected necrotic tooth pulp. However, in keratocysts and follicular cysts, such a stimulus is not present. In order to investigate what drives the cyst epithelium to proliferate, explant media and fluids from 16 radicular cysts, eight keratocysts and seven follicular cysts and explant media from four specimens of non-inflamed gingival tissue were examined for the presence of endotoxin and cytokines. Cyst fluids were also cultured for 72 h in anaerobic and aerobic conditions to detect micro-organisms. Endotoxin from three different bacteria, cytokines [interleukin-(IL) 1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6] as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were tested in an epithelial cell-proliferation assay. As the cyst epithelium is supported by a connective tissue capsule, the effect of fibroblast culture media on epithelial cell proliferation was also investigated. The results showed significantly higher concentrations of endotoxin in radicular cyst fluid than in the keratocyst or the follicular cyst. None of the cyst fluids contained micro-organisms. Immunoassays demonstrated the presence of IL-1 alpha and -6 in all fluids and explants tested; IL-1 beta was only found in the inflammatory radicular cysts. However, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNAs for IL-1 alpha, -1 beta and -6 were present in all cyst types. Proliferation studies indicated that endotoxin and the cytokines had a mitogenic effect on epithelia at low concentrations; PGE2 had very little effect at low concentrations, and had an inhibitory effect at high concentrations. Cyst fibroblast culture media had a mitogenic effect on the epithelia that was enhanced by the presence of endotoxin.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans promote osteoclastic differentiation in vitro.
AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharides possess bone-resorbing activity. Here, lipopolysaccharides from three putative periodontopathic bacteria were examined for effects on osteoclast-like cell formation of bone marrow cells from lipopolysaccharide-responsive C3H-HeN and non-responsive C3H/HeJ mice. The bone marrow cells were cultured with or without various doses of lipopolysaccharide in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone. These lipopolysaccharide preparations significantly increased the number of osteoclast-like cells formed in the culture of C3H/HeN marrow cells; the same as lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli and a synthetic lipid A with E. coli-type structure (LA-15-PP), at doses from 0.1 to 1 microgram/ml. This stimulating effect of each lipopolysaccharides was uniformly abrogated by the addition of polymyxin B at 5 micrograms/ml. All the lipopolysaccharide and the synthetic lipid A had no effect on osteoclast formation of the C3H/HeJ marrow cells, whereas lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia showed significant mitogenic activity on C3H/HeJ spleen cells. It seems likely that the activity of lipopolysaccharides to augment osteoclast-like cell formation in the bone marrow cell cultures is derived from a common structure of the lipid A portion.
TI  - Differential induction of IL-1 beta and IL-6 production by the nontoxic lipid A from Porphyromonas gingivalis in comparison with synthetic Escherichia coli lipid A in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 lipid A possesses 1-phospho beta(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively. P. gingivalis lipid A indicated lower activities in inducing interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA expression, pro-IL-1 beta protein synthesis and IL-1 beta production than those of synthetic Escherichia coli lipid A (compound 506) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The induction of IL-6 mRNA and IL-6 synthesis by P. gingivalis lipid A were comparable to those of compound 506. Herbimycin A, H-7 and H-8, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase, inhibited P. gingivalis lipid A- and compound 506-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 synthesis. W-7, an inhibitor of calmodulin (CaM) kinase, inhibited only P. gingivalis lipid A-induced IL-1 beta production. The result suggests that the CaM kinase-dependent cascade is involved in the down-regulation of IL-1 beta production by P. gingivalis lipid A. P. gingivalis lipid A and compound 506 also functioned in the induction of tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of several proteins in PBMC. P. gingivalis lipid A inhibited specific binding of fluorescein-labelled E. coli LPS to the PBMC. The nontoxic lipid A of P. gingivalis, having a chemical structure different from toxic compound 506, appears to induce the up- and down-regulation of the differential cytokine-producing activities following the activation of various intracellular enzymes including the CaM kinase through the common receptor sites of LPS.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. An in vitro study.
AB  - The effect of four different species of oral bacteria (Streptococci (X 2); Escherichia; Porphyromonas) on the adhesion of Candida albicans and Candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. Clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees C, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. Pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. Of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for E. coli-C. albicans and S. salivarius-C. albicans combinations. Candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to S. sanguis and P. gingivalis, but not E. coli. There were also significant differences in relative adhesion between C. albicans and C. krusei. Taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.
TI  - Simple and rapid method for isolation of RNA from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  
TI  - In vivo induction of apoptosis and immune responses in mice by administration of  lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - In vivo administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) to mice induced apoptosis before a specific immune response. Apoptosis was associated with the expression of immunoglobulin and Ia on B cells and of CD5 and several markers on T cells. Apoptosis peaked in the spleen and lymph nodes on day 2, and the second peak occurred in the thymus on day 9. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) could mediate apoptosis, because the serum TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher than those of controls at 1 day before apoptosis and recombinant murine TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. The apoptosis induced by Pg-LPS was similar to that induced by Escherichia coli LPS in its basic manner, but it was unique in the response of thymus T cells. It was suggested that Pg-LPS could induce apoptosis for the elimination of early nonspecific activated lymphocytes.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. In the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt A gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp A gene of Treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. These gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the PCR assays. Primers for P. gingivalis detected P. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of Capnocytophaga, 3 species of Prevotella, 2 species of Porphyromonas other than P. gingivalis, Bacteroides levii, Escherichia coli, 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of T. denticola. PCR analysis using primers for the lkt A gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Primers selected from the tdp A gene of T. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except T. denticola serovars a, b, and c. Thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either P. gingivalis (33277), A. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717 and 43718) or T. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). The PCR assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.
TI  - Nicotine effects on PGE2 and IL-1 beta release by LPS-treated human monocytes.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor in the development and further progression of periodontitis. However, little is known regarding the pathogenesis of smoking-related periodontal diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of nicotine, alone and in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on monocyte secretion of bone-resorbing factors, PGE2 and IL-1 beta. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) were isolated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation from 15 healthy, non-smoking donors. PBM were incubated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing nicotine (0, 50 ng/ml, 1 microgram/ml, 10 micrograms/ml and 100 micrograms/ml) with or without 10 micrograms/ml Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS or Escherichia coli LPS. Culture supernatants were assayed for PGE2 and IL-1 beta by ELISA. None of the nicotine preparations resulted in significant PBM secretion of PGE2 and IL-1 beta above that of unstimulated cultures. However, PGE2 release was potentiated 1.7-fold by the combination of P. gingivalis LPS and 10 micrograms/ml nicotine relative to P. gingivalis LPS alone (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Prostaglandin E2 release also was potentiated 3.5-fold by P. gingivalis LPS and 100 micrograms/ml nicotine relative to P. gingivalis LPS alone (p < 0.00001, one-way ANOVA) and 3.1-fold by E. coli LPS and 100 micrograms/ml nicotine relative to E. coli LPS alone (p < 0.00001, one-way ANOVA). IL-1 beta secretion was lower for either LPS plus 100 micrograms/ml nicotine relative to LPS alone, although not significantly. These data demonstrate upregulation of LPS-mediated monocyte secretion of PGE2 by nicotine and suggest a potential role for nicotine in periodontal disease pathogenesis.
TI  - Comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (SAM), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated bone and on various mammalian cell populations. In this study, the relative ability of the SAM from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha has been investigated. The bacteria investigated were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus. Human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the SAM, or of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each SAM. All SAMs demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - Mono-Mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. Activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. However, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each SAM when compared on a concentration basis (w/v). The most active SAM was from A. actinomycetemcomitans with those from E. corrodens and P. gingivalis being slightly less active. The least active cytokine-stimulating SAMs were from C. rectus and Pr. intermedia. One major difference between the SAMs and E. coli LPS was the inability of the former to stimulate HGFs to release IL-1 beta or TNF alpha although they could stimulate PBMCs to release these cytokines. This may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide increases cell surface-associated fibronectin in fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  - This study assessed the fibronectin expression by fibroblasts derived from noninflamed and inflamed gingiva by measuring the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin and fibronectin released into the medium. The effects of added lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens and Escherichia coli on both types of fibroblasts were also studied. In the absence of lipopolysaccharide, the amounts of the two types of fibronectin were significantly larger in the fibroblasts from inflamed than from noninflamed gingiva. The specific lipopolysaccharide had no effect on the amount of fibronectin released into the medium by either fibroblast type. The amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin increased significantly when lipopolysaccharide (0.1 and 1 microgram/ml) was added to the cells from the noninflamed gingiva (the effect was evident in the order: P. gingivalis>P.nigrescens>E. coli). Lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis significantly increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin even at a low concentration of lipopolysaccharide (0.01 microgram/ml). In fibroblasts from the inflamed gingiva, only the lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis was effective in increasing the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin. Our findings showed that the fibronectin expression was increased in the fibroblasts from inflamed gingiva and that lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin.
TI  - Stimulation of splenocytes in C3H/HeJ mice with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipid A  in comparison with enterobacterial lipid A.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 lipid A induced strong mitogenic response in splenic B cells separated from LPS-non-responsive C3H/HeJ mice as well as LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice, by using a magnetic cell sorting system. The lipid A also exhibited mitogenic activity in splenic T cells. P. gingivalis lipid A induced lower production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in splenic macrophage cultures and exhibited a comparable IL-6 producing activity in splenic B cells of C3H/HeN mice as compared to Escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid A (compound 506) and monophosphoryl lipid A from Salmonella minnesota Re 595 (MLA). Furthermore, P. gingivalis lipid A, but not compound 506 nor MLA, induced low IL-1 beta and high IL-6 production in C3H/HeJ mice. C3H/HeJ T cells in response to P. gingivalis lipid A stimulation resulted in definite IL-2 mRNA and its production, whereas IL-4 response was scarcely active in both C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ T cells. P. gingivalis lipid A increased tyrosine, serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins with various major induced bands in splenic B cells of both C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice. Thus, P. gingivalis lipid A stimulated the splenic immunocytes of C3H/HeJ as well as C3H/HeN mice.
TI  - Sequence and product analyses of the four genes downstream from the fimbrilin gene (fimA) of the oral anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The downstream DNA region of the fimbrilin gene (fimA), which encodes the major subunit protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae, was fully sequenced. Gene products, expressed from this region in Escherichia coli, were purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their partial amino acid sequences were determined to verify open reading frames (ORFs) found in the region by DNA sequencing. Four ORFs, designated ORF1, ORF2, ORF3 and ORF4, were found in the 5.8-kb PstI fragment downstream from fimA, which was previously cloned and partially characterized by Yoshimura, Takahashi, Hibi, Takasawa, Kato, and Dickinson (Infect. Immun. 61: 5181-5189, 1993). The direction of transcription of all the ORFs was the same as that of fimA. The 50 and 80 kDa encoded proteins, ORF2 and ORF3, respectively, have been reported to be minor components associated with fimbriae. The 15 and 19 kDa proteins, ORF1 and ORF4, respectively, have been expressed in E. coli but not identified in P. gingivalis. However, all the gene products of the ORFs, expressed in E. coli, appeared to contain intact signal peptides based on their N-terminal amino acid sequences.
TI  - Immunopharmacological activities of the nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid A of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The low endotoxic lipid A derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, 1-phospho beta(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively, induced mitogenic responses in LPS low responder C3H/HeJ as well as LPS responder C3H/HeN mouse splenocytes. The mitogenic activities of P. gingivalis lipid A in splenocytes of LPS responder mice were comparable to that of the synthetic Escherichia coli-type lipid A (compound 506). The addition of polymyxin B resulted in the inhibition of mitogenic activity. P. gingivalis lipid A also stimulated strongly nonspecific host resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in BALB/c mice, and specific immune response in guinea pigs against infection with P. gingivalis. Furthermore, P. gingivalis lipid A demonstrated antitumour activity against MH134 hepatoma in C3H/HeN mice. These life-preserving with tumour regression properties were comparable to those of monophosphoryl lipid A derived from Salmonella minnesota Re 595. Thus, P. gingivalis lipid A appears to have beneficial properties as an immunopharmacological agent.
TI  - Cloning, expression and sequence analysis of the genes encoding the heterodimeric methylmalonyl-CoA mutase of Porphyromonas gingivalis W50.
AB  - Two genes that encode methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) have been characterised in Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 (Pg). The genes, designated mcmA and mcmB are transcribed in an operon and encode the MCM small subunit (SS, 68,626 Da) and the MCM large subunit (LS, 78,703 Da), respectively. A recombinant Escherichia coli (Ec) clone harbouring the Pg mcmA and mcmB genes expressed MCM activity 280-times higher than that of the Ec control. The C terminus of the MCM LS has sequence homology to domains of a variety of enzymes that consume or produce methylmalonyl-CoA, suggesting that the MCM LS C-terminal domain is involved in substrate binding. The MCM LS C-terminal region also exhibits homology to other enzymes that have cobalamin-containing cofactors. It is likely, therefore, that the C terminus of the MCM LS is an important MCM domain involved in both substrate and cofactor binding.
TI  - Viability of four putative periodontal pathogens and enteric rods in the anaerobic transport medium VMGA III.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the survival in VMGA III of Porphyromonas  gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. Laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and Escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. Also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in VMGA III. Each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. One portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). The results of the clinical part indicate that the detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. Enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. However, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. Similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for E. coli. P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum survived better in the presence of E. coli than alone, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with E. coli. VMGA III appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. After 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.
TI  - Characterization, genetic analysis, and expression of a protease antigen (PrpRI)  of Porphyromonas gingivalis W50.
AB  - Previous studies of the serum immunoglobulin G antibody response of periodontal patients have demonstrated significant reactivity to a cell surface or extracellular arginine-specific protease of Porphyromonas gingivalis which migrates as an approximately 50-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. In the present report, two forms of the enzyme (ArgI and ArgIA) with this electrophoretic behavior were isolated. ArgI is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits, and ArgIA is a monomer composed of the catalytically active alpha component alone. The gene encoding ArgI (prpR1 encoding protease polyprotein ArgI) was cloned from Sau3AI digests of P. gingivalis W50 DNA into pUC18. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the alpha and beta components are contiguous on the initial translation product and are flanked by large N- and C-terminal extensions. prpR1 is 97.5% identical to the rgp-1 gene from P. gingivalis H66. prpR1 expression in Escherichia coli demonstrated the presence of an internal transcription-translation initiation site which could permit independent expression of different regions of the polyprotein. Immunochemical analysis of P. gingivalis mid-logarithmic-phase cultures suggested that the processing of PrpRI may be closely coupled to its synthesis, with only the final stages taking place at the cell surface. Southern hybridization studies demonstrated that the prpR1 gene is widely distributed in other P. gingivalis strains and that a second homologous locus to the alpha component and at least two other homologous loci to the beta component are present on the P. gingivalis chromosome. These data indicate that the ArgI protease of P. gingivalis is a member of a family of sequence-related gene products which may share both functional and antigenic properties.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide is poorly recognized by molecular components of innate host defense in a mouse model of early inflammation.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative bacterium that is associated with periodontitis. It has been hypothesized that destruction of bone and periodontal connective tissue is associated with colonization of the subgingival crevicular space by P. gingivalis, although how these bacteria overcome innate host defenses is largely unknown. To examine the early cellular and molecular events of P. gingivalis interaction with host tissues, we compared lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from this bacterium with Escherichia coli LPS, a potent inflammatory mediator, in a mouse model of acute inflammation. In these studies, mice were given intramuscular injections of either P. gingivalis LPS or E. coli LPS and then sacrificed after 4 h. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that expression of mRNAs for E- and P-selectins was higher in E. coli LPS-injected muscles than in P. gingivalis LPS-injected or control phosphate-buffered-saline-injected muscles. Similarly, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and fibroblast-induced cytokine mRNAs were expressed in E. coli LPS-injected muscles whereas their expression was reduced or absent in P. gingivalis LPS-injected samples. These results were confirmed by in situ hybridization whereby stronger hybridization for selectin mRNAs was observed in the endothelium of capillaries from E. coli LPS-injected samples than in that from P. gingivalis LPS-injected muscles. In addition, many monocytes expressing monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mRNA and polymorphonuclear leukocytes expressing fibroblast-induced cytokine mRNA were observed in E. coli LPS-injected muscles whereas only a few cells were identified in P. gingivalis LPS-injected muscles. These results demonstrate that compared with E. coli, P. gingivalis has a low biologically reactive LPS as measured by its weak activation of inflammation. This may allow P. gingivalis to evade innate host defense mechanisms, resulting in colonization and chronic disease.
TI  - An analogue of lipid A and LPS from Rhodobacter sphaeroides inhibits neutrophil responses to LPS by blocking receptor recognition of LPS and by depleting LPS-binding protein in plasma.
AB  - When incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of plasma, neutrophils become primed for enhanced release of superoxide in response to triggering by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). The effect of LPS on phagocytes is inhibited by a synthetic lipid A precursor, LA-14-PP (lipid IVa) or by LPS from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Rs). We studied the mechanisms by which LA-14-PP or Rs-LPS inhibited LPS-induced responses. When neutrophils were exposed to LA-14-PP or Rs-LPS for 3 min and then to Escherichia coli-LPS, the antagonists inhibited priming for superoxide release, and also blocked up-regulation of CD11b and adherence. This inhibition was dependent on plasma, was not overcome by higher amounts of E. coli-LPS or plasma, and was not observed at 0 degrees C, suggesting that E. coli-LPS was not able to interact with its receptor or other cellular recognition molecule in neutrophils that had been exposed to the antagonists. The alternative possibility that LA-14-PP or Rs-LPS depleted a plasma cofactor, resulting in inhibition of priming, was investigated by using LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Bordetella pertussis (Bp). These LPS primed neutrophils in a plasma-dependent and CD14-dependent manner, but were not blocked by LA-14-PP or Rs-LPS. When sub-optimal concentrations of plasma were exposed to LA-14-PP or Rs-LPS, and then mixed with Pg-LPS or Bp-LPS, followed by incubation with neutrophils, priming and up-regulation of CD11b were inhibited, and this inhibition was overcome by increasing the concentration of plasma. Binding of LPS-binding protein (LBP) in plasma to immobilized E. coli-LPS was inhibited by pre-incubation of plasma with LA-14-PP or Rs-LPS. Together with the result that treatment of plasma with anti-LBP antibody abolished the cofactor activity of plasma, these results indicated that LA-14-PP and Rs-LPS depleted LBP from plasma, resulting in inability of LPS to act on neutrophils. Thus LA-14-PP and Rs-LPS inhibited the action of LPS on neutrophils by at least two mechanisms, blocking of LPS receptor recognition and depletion of the cofactor LBP.
TI  - Identification of Porphyromonas gingivalis prefimbrilin possessing a long leader  peptide: possible involvement of trypsin-like protease in fimbrilin maturation.
AB  - Fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis have been shown to be important as one of the virulence factors for colonization on mucosal surfaces. The gene (fimA) encoding the fimbrial subunit (fimbrilin) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli by using a bacteriophage T7 promoter-polymerase expression vector system. Analysis of the resulting fimA gene product revealed that the prefimbrilin had a 46 amino acid leader peptide. This extremely long leader peptide was cleaved from the prefimbrilin by treatment with trypsin or P. gingivalis extracts containing trypsin-like protease activity, resulting in production of a mature fimbrilin. We also found that some transposon-induced trypsin-like protease deficient mutants of P. gingivalis exhibited deficiency in fimbriation and that one of the mutants accumulated a fimbrilin precursor possessing a 25 amino acid leader peptide in the cell. The presence of an extremely long leader peptide and the requirement for a leader peptidase with a substrate specificity similar to that of P. gingivalis trypsin-like protease for fimbrilin maturation indicate that P. gingivalis fimbrilin is a novel type that is different from fimbrilins of type I and IV families.
TI  - Arylsulphatase from Alteromonas carrageenovora.
AB  - Arylsulphatase activity was identified in cultures of the marine bacterium Alteromonas carrageenovora, using methylumbelliferyl sulphate as substrate. In contrast with most other microbial arylsulphatases, arylsulphatase production in A. carrageenovora was not repressed by sulphate. The structural gene of arylsulphatase (atsA) was cloned and sequenced. An ORF of 984 bp was found, specifying a primary translation product of 328 amino acids with a molecular mass of 35797 Da. Arylsulphatase was partially purified from cell extracts of both A. carrageenovora and recombinant Escherichia coli. Both the recombinant and native enzymes exhibited a pI of 5.5, a Michaelis constant for methylumbelliferyl sulphate of 68 microM, and a molecular mass of approximately 35,000 Da in SDS-PAGE analysis. Secondary structure comparisons using hydrophobic cluster analysis suggest functional analogies between the arylsulphatase of A. carrageenovora, that of Mycobacterium leprae and a 33.5 kDa protein from Porphyromonas gingivalis. It is speculated that these proteins are all glycosulphohydrolases, involved with desulphatation of sulphated polysaccharides.
TI  - The cloning, expression and sequence analysis of a second Porphyromonas gingivalis gene that codes for a protein involved in hemagglutination.
AB  - It has been suggested that Porphyromonas gingivalis may possess more than one hemagglutinin. We have previously reported the cloning of a gene (hagA) that encodes a hemagglutinin. In this study we report the cloning, characterization, and sequencing of a second gene (hagB) that encodes a protein that also appears to be involved in hemagglutination. Antiserum to the clone (ST 7) was found to inhibit hemagglutination by P. gingivalis 381, and hemagglutinating inhibition activity of anti-P. gingivalis antiserum was reduced by adsorption of the antiserum with cells of clone ST 7. Restriction mapping and Southern analysis indicates there is little or no DNA homology between this cloned 4.8-kb HindIII DNA fragment and a cloned hemagglutinin gene we have previously described. Minicell analysis of the cloned P. gingivalis chromosomal DNA fragment revealed that the major gene product is a 49-kDa protein. Immunoaffinity chromatography using purified rabbit immunoglobulin G against the cloned protein resulted in the purification of a major reactive 49- to 50-kDa protein from a P. gingivalis cell lysate. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the hagB open reading frame to be 1053 nucleotides in length with a mol% G+C of 59.9% coding for a protein of 350 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 39.375 kDa. This protein was also determined to be basic and hydrophilic and to contain a potential signal peptide. Comparison of both the nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences with computer-based databases did not reveal any significant homologies between habB and any other previously sequenced genes.
TI  - Identification of a chromosomally encoded kanamycin acetylase in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Sonic extracts from the test strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens were tested for the ability to inactivate kanamycin sulfate in the presence of ATP or acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Residual kanamycin activity was determined by a bio-assay using Escherichia coli JM109 as the assay organism. Sonic extracts of all test strains of P. gingivalis inactivated kanamycin. All strains tested in this study required the presence of acetyl-CoA for inactivation, indicating that inactivation was by acetylation. The gene of a kanamycin-inactivating protein from P. gingivalis 16-1 was cloned into E. coli utilizing the plasmid vector PTZ18R. The resultant kanamycin-resistant clone, harboring plasmid pPG16 with a P. gingivalis insert, expressed a kanamycin-inactivating activity, which was enhanced by the addition of acetyl-CoA, confirming that the kanamycin was inactivated by acetylation. Southern blot analysis indicates that the gene was conserved among all P. gingivalis strains tested.
TI  - Inflammatory cytokine gene expression in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - The effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P-LPS) and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (E-LPS) on the gene expression and production of inflammatory cytokines of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLF) were examined by a Northern (RNA blot) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. mRNAs for interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) were detected in HPLF cells, but IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were not detected by reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of TGF-beta mRNA was not influenced by either LPS. P-LPS (1 to 10 micrograms/ml) and E-LPS (100 micrograms/ml) markedly stimulated the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNAs compared with the control. The synthesis of IL-6 and IL-8 was also stimulated by 10 and 100 micrograms of both LPSs per ml, but IL-8 synthesis was not stimulated with E-LPS at 1 microgram/ml. Secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 into the culture medium was detected at 6 and 3 h, respectively, after exposure to P-LPS (10 micrograms/ml). These findings suggested that P. gingivalis leads to periodontal tissue destruction and alveolar bone resorption through IL-6 and IL-8 released from HPLF cells stimulated with its LPS.
TI  - A murC gene in Porphyromonas gingivalis 381.
AB  - The gene encoding a 51 kDa polypeptide of Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was isolated by immunoblotting using an antiserum raised against P. gingivalis alkaline phosphatase. DNA sequence analysis of a 2.5 kb DNA fragment containing a gene encoding the 51 kDa protein revealed one complete and two incomplete ORFs. Database searches using the FASTA program revealed significant homology between the P. gingivalis 51 kDa protein and the MurC protein of Escherichia coli, which functions in peptidoglycan synthesis. The cloned 51 kDa protein encoded a functional product that complemented an E. coli murC mutant. Moreover, the ORF just upstream of murC coded for a protein that was 31% homologous with the E. coli MurG protein. The ORF just downstream of murC coded for a protein that was 17% homologous with the Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2B (PBP2B), which functions in peptidoglycan synthesis and is responsible for antibiotic resistance. These results suggest that P. gingivalis contains a homologue of the E. coli peptidoglycan synthesis gene murC and indicate the possibility of a cluster of genes responsible for cell division and cell growth, as in the E. coli mra region.
TI  - Tyrosine protein phosphorylation in murine B lymphocytes by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The molecular effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from porphyromonas gingivalis as well as Escherichia coli on the tyrosine protein phosphorylation in the splenic B lymphocytes from LPS-responsive C3H/HeN and LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice was examined. P. gingivalis LPS induced tyrosine phosphorylation of selected membrane proteins that included the phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of 24.8 kDa and 26.0 kDa (p24.8 and p26.) in the B lymphocytes from both strains of mice, while E. coli LPS induced p24.8 and p26.0 in C3H/HeN B Lymphocytes only. These findings suggest that through the same tyrosine phosphorylation pathway as observed in C3H/HeN B lymphocytes, P. gingivalis LPS induced the activation of C3H/HeJ B lymphocytes in which a trigger signal by E. coli LPS could not be transduced to initiate tyrosine protein phosphorylation.
TI  - A peptide, ALTTE, within the fimbrial subunit protein from Porphyromonas gingivalis, induces production of interleukin 6, gene expression and protein phosphorylation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 fimbriae and a synthetic peptide composed of residues 69-73 (ALTTE) of the fimbrial subunit protein, FP381(69-73), function in the induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6) production, IL-6 mRNA expression, and tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of several proteins in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Herbimycin A and H-7, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C (PKC), markedly inhibited IL-6 production, gene expression, and tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins. An inactive analog of synthetic peptide replaced alanine to glycine at position 69 in FP381(69-73), GLTTE, exhibited an antagonistic effect on the IL-6 production induced by the fimbriae. These results suggest that the peptide ALTTE functions as an agent in inflammatory reactions and immune responses in the inflamed gingival and periodontal tissues, in which the participation of protein phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases and PKC in signal transduction may be considered.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kDa protein of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The 64-kDa protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a GroEL-like protein. The DNA fragment containing the groEL gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the groESL operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from A. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the 64-kDa protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kDa proteins of Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Escherichia coli and Eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. It is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kDa protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.
TI  - Differential expression of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 in human monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from different microbes.
AB  - Macrophages respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and activate several host defense functions through production of mediators. However, it is not clear whether the degree of macrophage responsiveness to different sources of LPS is equivalent to or varies with the source of LPS. Therefore, in this report, we examined the extent of the human monocyte response to LPS derived from two oral pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). Additionally, due to its well-established ability to activate monocytes, we used LPS from Escherichia coli (Ec). Human monocytes, when activated with a specific source of LPS, exhibited rapid expression of mRNA for IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-8, which was followed by IL-6, as measured by RNA-PCR. Moreover, the expression of mRNA for these cytokines was followed by cytokine synthesis. Monocytes from the same subject, when activated with LPS from Pg, Aa, or Ec expressed quantitatively different levels of mRNA and proteins for all four cytokines. A given LPS induced either high or low expression of the battery of cytokines tested, indicating that the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines may be regulated by a single or a cluster of gene(s). However, no apparent differences in the time course of mRNA expression for these cytokines were observed in response to any of the LPS tested. Furthermore, the relative ability of the different sources of LPS to induce mRNA for cytokines varied throughout a wide range of LPS concentrations. This suggests that differences exist in the sensitivity of monocytes to a specific LPS, rather than in the kinetics of the secretory process itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Ability of bacteria associated with chronic inflammatory disease to stimulate E-selectin expression and promote neutrophil adhesion.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Helicobacter pylori have been shown to be associated with adult periodontal disease, chronic lung infections, and peptic ulcers, respectively. The ability of these bacteria to stimulate E-selectin expression and promote neutrophil adhesion, two components necessary for the recruitment of leukocytes in response to infection, was investigated. Little or no stimulation of E-selectin expression was observed with either P. gingivalis or H. pylori when whole cells, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or cell wall preparations added to human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were examined. P. aeruginosa was able to induce E-selectin to near-maximal levels; however, it required approximately 100 to 1,000 times more whole cells or LPS than that required by E. coli. Neutrophil-binding assays revealed that LPS and cell wall preparations obtained from these bacteria did not promote endothelial cell adhesiveness by E-selectin-independent mechanisms. In addition, P. gingivalis LPS blocked E-selectin expression by LPS obtained from other bacteria. We propose that lack of E-selectin stimulation and the inability to promote endothelial cell adhesiveness are two additional indications of low biologically reactive LPS. We suggest that this property of LPS may contribute to host tissue colonization. In addition, the ability of P. gingivalis to inhibit E-selectin expression may represent a new virulence factor for this organism.
TI  - Effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  - Human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the DNA content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. LPS samples were purified from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS was used as a positive control. At a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the LPSs caused any change in the production of DNA or protein, whereas the amount of DNA was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. Protein synthesis was decreased by LPSs at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. Alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of LPS tested.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from periodontal pathogens prime neutrophils for enhanced respiratory burst: differential effect of a synthetic lipid a precursor IVA (LA-14-PP).
AB  - When neutrophils are incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), they become primed for enhanced release of superoxide anion (O2-) in response to stimulation by FMLP. We investigated the human neutrophil-priming activity of LPS from the periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) in comparison with that of LPS from Escherichia coli (E. coli). The optimum conditions for LPS to prime neutrophils were assessed for every LPS and found to be as follows: Neutrophils were incubated with LPS in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated plasma and 1 mM EDTA at 37 degrees C for 30 min and then stimulated with 1 microM FMLP at 37 degrees C for 7 min. Under these conditions, half-maximum priming was observed at 6.2 ng/ml Pg-LPS, 45 ng/ml Pi-LPS, 1.5 ng/ml Aa-LPS and 1.5 ng/ml E. coli-LPS. The priming activity of each LPS was neutralized by polymyxin B. Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody inhibited priming by all LPS. The priming by Aa-LPS and E. coli-LPS was inhibited by LA-14-PP, a synthetic lipid A precursor IVA, but that by Pg-LPS and Pi-LPS was not. Priming by tumor necrosis factor alpha was not affected by polymyxin B, anti-CD14 antibody or LA-14-PP. Gelation of Limulus amebocyte lysate occurred at 10 pg/ml Pg-LPS, 30 pg/ml Pi-LPS, 3 pg/ml Aa-LPS and 3 pg/ml E. coli-LPS. Thus LPS from different periodontal pathogens primed neutrophils with different efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Catalytic site targeted mutagenesis of the alpha-gingivain gene of Porphyromonas  gingivalis using Tn-4351 to generate isogenic mutants.
AB  - The extracellular proteinases of the anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis, are implicated in the destruction of host defence mechanisms in periodontitis. We have previously purified one of these enzymes, alpha-gingivain, and established that it belongs to the cysteine proteinase family of enzymes. In the present study, transposon Tn4351 was used to alter the open reading frame encoding a region that includes the catalytic site of alpha-gingivain by targeted mutagenesis. Escherichia coli HB101 which harbours R751 was used to introduce the transposon into P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 by conjugal transfer. E. coli was transformed using the altered plasmid with a Cla I site insertion of a sequence common to the catalytic site histidine or cysteine of many cysteine proteinases. The frequency of the transconjugation was 4.5 x 10(5) while the recipient viable counts comprised 60% of the original P. gingivalis. The result of this targeted mutagenesis was inactivation of gingivains such that some colonies on skimmed-milk agar plates showed no clear surrounding zones of hydrolysis and their normal catalytic activity towards L-BAPNA was destroyed.
TI  - Structural characterization of argingipain, a novel arginine-specific cysteine proteinase as a major periodontal pathogenic factor from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Argingipain, so termed due to its peptide cleavage specificity at arginine residue, is a unique extracellular cysteine proteinase produced by the anaerobic rod Porphyromonas gingivalis, which is known as a major pathogenic factor of the progressive periodontal disease (T. Kadowaki, M. Yoneda, K. Okamoto, K. Maeda, and K. Yamamoto (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21371-21378). The catalytic specificity and functional importance of this enzyme prompted us to elucidate its structural features. A DNA fragment for argingipain was selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction using mixed oligonucleotide primers designed from the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. Although the extracellular mature enzyme was shown to have an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa in gels, the nucleotide sequence of the isolated gene revealed a single gene coding for a 109-kDa precursor of argingipain. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited no significant similarity to the sequences of representative members of the cysteine protease family. The precursor contained four functional domains: the NH2-terminal signal peptide required for the inner membrane transport; the NH2-terminal prosequence, which is assumed to stabilize the precursor structure; the proteinase domain; and the COOH-terminal hemagglutinin domain, which appears to be essential for extracellular secretion of the proteinase domain. Experiments involving the addition of the argingipain inhibitors to the culture medium of P. gingivalis suggested that the maturation of argingipain occurs intracellularly via an autocatalytic cleavage of the pro-argingipain propeptide.
TI  - Revised sequence of the Porphyromonas gingivalis prtT cysteine protease/hemagglutinin gene: homology with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B/streptococcal proteinase.
AB  - The prtT gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53977 was previously isolated from an Escherichia coli clone possessing trypsinlike protease activity upstream of a region encoding hemagglutinin activity (J. Otogoto and H. Kuramitsu, Infect. Immun. 61;117-123, 1993). Subsequent molecular analysis of this gene has revealed that the PrtT protein is larger than originally reported, encompassing the hemagglutination region. Results of primer extension experiments indicate that the translation start site was originally misidentified. An alternate open reading frame of nearly 2.7 kb, which encodes a protein in the size range of 96 to 99 kDa, was identified. In vitro transcription-translation experiments confirm this size, and Northern (RNA) blot experiments indicate that the protease is translated from a 3.3-kb mRNA. Searching the EMBL protein database revealed that the amino acid sequence of the revised PrtT is similar to sequences of two related proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes. PrtT is 31% identical and 73% similar over 401 amino acids to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B. In addition, it is 36% identical and 74% similar over 244 amino acids with streptococcal proteinase, which is closely related to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B. The similarity is particularly high at the putative active site of streptococcal proteinase, which is similar to the active sites of the family of cysteine proteases. Thus, we conclude that PrtT is a 96- to 99-kDa cysteine protease and hemagglutinin with significant similarity to streptococcal enzymes.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the nahA gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis indicates that beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase is an outer-membrane-associated lipoprotein.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in human periodontal diseases. It expresses a number of exoglycosidase enzymes capable of hydrolysing host proteoglycan residues. As a first stage to explore the role of these enzymes in periodontal tissue damage, the nahA gene of P. gingivalis W83, which encodes beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (beta-Nahase), was cloned. The gene was expressed poorly in Escherichia coli, but increased expression was achieved by cloning the nahA gene downstream of the tac promoter. Southern blot analysis revealed that nahA was present as a single copy, and it was found in all the other P. gingivalis strains tested. In contrast, sequences homologous to nahA were not detected in either P. endodontalis or P. asaccharolytica. The nahA gene was 2331 bp long and encoded a beta-Nahase enzyme of 777 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kDa. A characteristic signal peptide for an acylated lipoprotein was present at the amino-terminus, suggesting that the mature beta-Nahase is a lipoprotein. The predicted amino acid sequence of the P. gingivalis beta-Nahase shared homology with the catalytic domains of the human beta-Nahase enzyme and the chitinase of Vibrio harveyi, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism.
TI  - Endotoxin affinity for provisional restorative resins.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared the relative affinity of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli endotoxin, bacterial cell envelope lipopolysaccharide (LPS), for three provisional resins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As-polymerized and pumiced polymethyl methacrylate and polyethyl methacrylate resin discs were exposed to 1,000 endotoxin U/mL P. gingivalis or E. coli LPS in water for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, whereas control discs were placed in LPS-free water. LPS-treated discs were transferred at 24-hour intervals to fresh, LPS-free water for up to 96 hours, and the incubated eluates were tested for the presence of LPS. RESULTS: Initial adherence of P. gingivalis LPS to as-polymerized and pumiced-finish resin was a function of resin type, but surface characteristics modified adherence levels. When steady rates of elution were reached at 72 to 96 hours, as-polymerized specimens released significantly greater LPS levels than pumiced samples. Comparison of initial adherence of P. gingivalis and E. coli LPS with pumiced resins showed that adherence was based on a combination of LPS and resin type. P. gingivalis LPS had a greater relative affinity for polyethyl methacrylate, and E. coli LPS has a greater relative affinity for polymethyl methacrylate. Regardless of resin type, P. gingivalis LPS eluted at levels greater than E. coli LPS. CONCLUSIONS: The affinity of LPS for provisional resins seems to be a function of selective interactions based on the chemical nature of the resin, the surface finish of the resin, and the molecular structure of the LPS.
TI  - Effects of cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on the leukocyte function-associated antigen 1/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 pathway in gingival fibroblasts in adult periodontitis.
AB  - We investigated the effects of inflammatory cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1) in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). Cell surface ICAM-1 was upregulated on HGF under transcriptional control by exposure not only to interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon but also to sonic extracts prepared from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia (nigrescens) and lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli. However, these stimuli induced only minimal expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin on HGF. Binding assays using HGF and Molt 4, the human T-cell leukemia cell line, showed induced ICAM-1 to be functional, and the increased binding was blocked by a combination of monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. Furthermore, gingival tissues from adult periodontitis patients showed increased mRNA expression of ICAM-1 compared with that in tissues from normal healthy donors. In immunohistological analysis, we also observed in vivo that the expression of ICAM-1 on fibroblasts in adult periodontitis tissues was greater than that in normal gingiva. Thus, the overexpression of ICAM-1 on gingival fibroblasts induced by cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria is speculated to be deeply involved in the accumulation and retention of leukocyte function-associated antigen 1-bearing leukocytes in adult periodontitis lesions.
TI  - Characterisation of IS1126 from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83: a new member of the IS4 family of insertion sequence elements.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of IS1126, the only insertion sequence so far isolated from the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, has been determined. It had a nucleotide sequence of 1338 base pair (bp) flanked by 12 bp perfect inverted repeats and generated a 5 bp target site duplication. The single major open reading frame encoded a predicted protein of 361 amino acids and molecular mass of 41 kDa. The gene encoding the transposase was subcloned into pUC18 and the transposase expressed in Escherichia coli minicells. The predicted amino acid sequence of the transposase had homology to putative transposases of IS1106 and IS1186 both of which belong to the IS5 group within the IS4 super-family of insertion elements. On the basis of this homology we propose that IS1126 should also be included in the IS5 group. Southern-blot analysis of a number of P. gingivalis strains using IS1126 as a probe revealed a unique pattern of hybridisation for each strain and the absence of IS1126 from other closely related Porphyromonas species. This should allow IS1126 to be used as a rapid epidemiological tool in studying oral infections by P. gingivalis.
TI  - Effects of Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide on pregnancy outcome in the golden hamster.
AB  - This report describes the effects of two gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) preparations on hamster pregnancy outcome variables. Single intravenous challenges with Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS on day 8 of pregnancy produced dose-dependent effects on fetal weight malformation and fetal resorption with E. coli LPS having potent embryolethal effects. Premating maternal exposure to P. gingivalis produced embryolethal effects similar to those of E. coli. These data suggest that maternal exposure to P. gingivalis LPS prior to and during pregnancy can induce deleterious effects on the developing fetus.
TI  - Smokeless tobacco effects on monocyte secretion of PGE2 and IL-1 beta.
AB  - The use of smokeless tobacco (ST) products is associated with mucosal lesions, gingival recession, and attachment loss at the site of tobacco placement. Monocytes/macrophages are primary producers of PGE2 and IL-1 beta, inflammatory mediators which are thought to play a role in the destruction of the periodontium. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ST alone and in combination with a major stimulator of inflammation, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on monocyte secretion of these mediators. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) were isolated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation from 15 healthy donors who were non-ST users. PBM were incubated for 24 hours in RPMI 1640 containing various concentrations of ST (0%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 1%) with or without 10 micrograms/ml LPS (Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS or Escherichia coli LPS). Of the ST preparations, only 1% ST resulted in PBM mediator secretion (7.7 +/- 2.0 ng/ml for PGE2 and 1.3 +/- 0.2 ng/ml for IL-1 beta) above that of control (unstimulated) cultures. Furthermore, the combination of 1% ST and LPS resulted in a potentiation of PGE2 release (5-fold for E. coli LPS + 1% ST and 10-fold for P. gingivalis LPS + 1% ST; P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) relative to the LPS preparations alone. In contrast, PBM IL-1 beta release decreased more than 2-fold upon E. coli LPS and 1% ST exposure, relative to treatment with E. coli LPS alone (P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the groESL homologue from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The homologue of groESL from Porphyromonas gingivalis was cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing suggested an operon containing two open reading frames (ORFs) homologous to groESL operon of Escherichia coli. The upstream ORF consisted of 267 bp corresponding to 89 amino acid residues. The downstream ORF consisted of 1635 bp corresponding to 545 amino acid residues.

TI  - Hemagglutinating and chemotactic properties of synthetic peptide segments of fimbrial protein from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 fimbriae, their synthetic peptide segments, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were examined for hemagglutinating and migration-stimulating activities. P. gingivalis 381 fimbriae clearly caused hemagglutination, and several oligopeptide segments such as FP381(61-80), FP381(171-185), and FP381(302-321), corresponding to the amino acid residue numbers based on the amino acid sequence of fimbrillin proposed by Dickinson et al. (D. P. Dickinson, M. A. Kubiniec, F. Yoshimura, and R. J. Genco, J. Bacteriol. 170:1658-1665, 1988), were also demonstrated to agglutinate erythrocytes although less effectively than the native fimbriae. Furthermore, P. gingivalis 381 LPS but not Escherichia coli O55:B5 LPS definitely exhibited hemagglutination. P. gingivalis fimbriae as well as their synthetic peptides possessing hemagglutinating activity enhanced the chemotaxically induced migration of human peripheral blood monocytes. The results of the analyses using synthetic peptide FP381(61-80), its related compounds, and an analog suggested that the amino acid sequence XLTXXLTXXNXX within fimbrial protein molecules may play an important role structurally in the attachment of the protein to host cells such as erythrocytes and monocytes.
TI  - Stress response of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The heat shock response of Porphyromonas gingivalis was examined by 1- and 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after metabolic labeling with [14C]-amino acids. When P. gingivalis cells were shifted from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C, elevated synthesis of 4 proteins with the apparent molecular weight of 92, 80, 74, and 62 kDa was observed, and synthesis of a 50-kDa protein decreased during heat shock. The 74- and 62-kDa proteins were identified as homologs of Escherichia coli DnaK and GroEL respectively by Western immunoblotting. On 2-dimensional Western blots, 2 forms of DnaK and 4 forms of GroEL were identified due to their slightly different isolelectric points. dnaK and groEL gene homologs were identified in several P. gingivalis strains and some other black-pigmented oral species. DnaK and GroEL homolog proteins were induced when P. gingivalis cells were challenged by ethanol. These proteins were not induced by oxidative stress or change in pH.
TI  - Heat shock protein 60 (GroEL) from Porphyromonas gingivalis: molecular cloning and sequence analysis of its gene and purification of the recombinant protein.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with human periodontal disease. We cloned  and sequenced the gene for heat shock protein 60 (GroEL, HSP60) from P. gingivalis FDC381. The identified clone carried a 2.6 kb DNA fragment which contained two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding a 9.6- and a 58.4-kDa protein. The translated amino acid sequence of these ORFs showed a high degree of homology with known sequences for GroES and GroEL from several bacterial species and humans. Escherichia coli carrying this clone expressed a 65-kDa protein which was recognized by anti-Mycobacterium leprae HSP60 monoclonal antibody. We purified the 65-kDa protein by DEAE-sepharose chromatography and hydroxyapatite chromatography. This protein was immunogenic and was recognized by sera from a number of patients with periodontal disease. This immunological reactivity and the existence of molecular mimicry between the P. gingivalis GroEL and other HSP homologs may indicate an important role for this molecule in periodontal lesion.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of chemically defined lipid A from lipopolysaccharides of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Immunobiological activities of chemically defined lipid A from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, which possesses beta-(1-->6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide 1-monophosphate, with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively, were compared with those of synthetic Escherichia coli-type lipid A (compound 506) and Salmonella-type lipid A (compound 516). P. gingivalis lipid A and its LPS induced stronger or comparable production of the cytokines interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon-gamma as compared with compounds 506 and 516 in the culture supernatants of human peripheral blood monocytes or mononuclear cells. However, the P. gingivalis preparations showed low activity in inducing the production of IL-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Clear antagonistic effects of P. gingivalis lipid A and its LPS against IL-1 beta production induced by E. coli LPS or compound 506 were seen. Furthermore, P. gingivalis lipid A and its LPS had marked immunopharmacological activities, i.e. antitumour, natural killer cell and antiviral activities. Its monophosphorylation pattern and the presence and position of fatty acids possessing acyl chains of considerable length are unique to P. gingivalis lipid A, differing from enterobacterial lipid As. Its good balance between agonistic and antagonistic effects, making it a possible candidate for use as an immunomodulatory drug, may be attributable to these unique features.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a fimA mutant of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Although fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis have been implicated as playing a major role in adherence to gingival tissue surfaces, no conclusive genetic evidence has yet been obtained. The fimA gene, the determinant for the major fimbrial subunit protein, was cloned and sequenced (D. P. Dickinson, M. A. Kubiniec, F. Yoshimura, and R. J. Genco, J. Bacteriol. 170:1658-1665, 1988). We undertook to inactivate the fimA gene by a homologous recombination technique and examined the fimA mutant for changes in surface properties, including production of fimbriae, adherence to human gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells, hemagglutinating activity, and surface hydrophobicity. To inactivate the fimA gene, we disrupted a fimA clone by insertion of a DNA segment containing an erythromycin resistance (Emr) gene. This was then delivered into P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 from an Escherichia coli K-12 strain, SM10 lambda pir, by using a mobilizable suicide vector, pGP704; recombination at the fimA locus led to the isolation of a fimA mutant. Disruption of the fimA locus and disappearance of FimA production were confirmed by Southern hybridization with a fimA-specific DNA probe and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against the FimA protein, respectively. The fimA mutant constructed failed to express long (0.5- to 1.0-micron) fimbriae from the bacterial surface and had a diminished adhesive capacity to tissue-cultured human gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Observation of the bacteria adhering to human gingival fibroblasts by scanning electron microscopy revealed that the wild-type strain had dramatic local changes in the appearance of the microvilli at the point of contact with large bacterial clumps, whereas the fimA mutant did not. In contrast, neither the hemagglutinating activity nor the surface hydrophobicity was changed in the fimA mutant. These data thus constitute the first direct genetic evidence demonstrating that the FimA protein of P. gingivalis is essential for the interaction of the organism with human gingival tissue cells through a function(s) encoded by the fimA gene.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide stimulation of human monocytes: dependence on serum and CD14 receptor.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing the ability of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis to elicit secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) from human monocytes (adherent mononuclear cells). The results indicate that P. gingivalis LPS stimulation of TNF alpha from monocytes is comparable to LPS from Escherichia coli. Both LPS, although structurally different, increased TNF alpha secretion in a dose-dependent manner. In serum-free conditions, TNF alpha secretion was relatively low, but it dramatically increased at human serum concentrations as low as 1%. Maximal secretion was observed in the presence of 10% serum, with a slight decrease at higher serum concentrations. The CD14 molecule is a putative monocyte LPS receptor. When cells were pre-incubated with a blocking monoclonal antibody (My4) to CD14, TNF alpha-mRNA accumulation and TNF alpha secretion were reduced to control levels at LPS concentrations of up to 10 ng/ml. At higher LPS concentrations, the blocking effect was only partial, in spite of 50-fold excess antibody concentration. The blocking effect was observed only in the presence of serum. The effect of the CD14 antibody was dose-dependent with saturation at 2.5 micrograms/ml. The results suggest that CD14 is one of the major receptors for P. gingivalis LPS but highlight the necessity to investigate other cell-surface receptors mediating P. gingivalis-LPS interactions. These interactions are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal destruction.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae and their synthetic peptides induce proinflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood monocyte cultures.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae as well as synthetic peptides that mimic the fimbrial subunit protein, which includes the amino acid sequence XLTXXLTXXNXX, induced high production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha in human peripheral blood monocyte/macrophage cultures. Responses induced by some peptide segments were comparable to those induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides. A chemically modified peptide analogous to an active peptide segment was found to be antagonistic with regard to interleukin-6 production induced by the native fimbriae. It may be suggested that P. gingivalis fimbriae and their degraded peptides function as proinflammatory agents in vivo, while certain analog peptides inhibited the process.
TI  - Immunobiological properties of chemically defined lipid A from lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 lipid A, characterized by beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide 1-phosphate, with one hydroxyacyl group and one acyloxyacl group, i.e., 3-hydroxy-15-methyl-hexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2 and 2' positions, respectively, was less endotoxically active than the synthetic Escherichia-coli-type lipid A (compound 506), which possesses beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate, with two acyloxyacyl groups at the 2' and 3' positions and two 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl group at the 2 and 3 positions and the synthetic Salmonella-type lipid A (compound 516), which has three acyloxyacyl groups at the 2,2' and 3' positions and one hydroxyacyl group at the 3 position. P. gingivalis lipid A exhibited no or very low endotoxic activities, i.e., lethal toxicity in galactosamine-loaded mice, preparative ability for local Shwartzman reaction, pyrogenicity and Limulus test as compared with compounds 506 and 516. However, polyclonal B-cell activation of BALB/c mouse splenocytes was as strong as that of compound 506. Furthermore, P. gingivalis lipid A had stronger immunoadjuvant and hemagglutinating activities than compound 506. The absence of ester-linked phosphate at the 4' position and ester-linked fatty acids, and the presence and positions of fatty acids possessing considerable lengths of acyl chains are unique features of P. gingivalis lipid A, and they differentiate this lipid A from enterobacterial and other lipids A. The good balance between endotoxic properties and beneficial immunobiological activities of P. gingivalis lipid A may be attributable to these features.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis invades human pocket epithelium in vitro.
AB  - The present study examined the adhesive and invasive potential of Porphyromonas gingivalis interacting with human pocket epithelium in vitro. Pocket epithelial tissue, obtained during periodontal surgery of patients with advanced periodontal disease, generated a stratified epithelium in culture. P. gingivalis strains W50 and FDC 381 (laboratory strains), OMGS 712, 1439, 1738, 1739 and 1743 (clinical isolates) as well as Escherichia coli strain HB101 (non-adhering control) were tested with respect to epithelial adhesion and invasion. Adhesion was quantitated by scintillation spectrometry after incubation of radiolabeled bacteria with epithelial cells. The invasive ability of P. gingivalis was measured by means of an antibiotic protection assay. The epithelial multilayers were infected with the test and control strains and subsequently incubated with an antibiotic mixture (metronidazole 0.1 mg/ml and gentamicin 0.5 mg/ml). The number of internalized bacteria surviving the antibiotic treatment was assessed after plating lyzed epithelial cells on culture media. All tested P. gingivalis strains adhered to and entered pocket epithelial cells. However, considerable variation in their adhesive and invasive potential was observed. E. coli strain HB101 did not adhere or invade. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that internalization of P. gingivalis was preceded by formation of microvilli and coated pits on the epithelial cell surfaces. Intracellular bacteria were most frequently surrounded by endosomal membranes; however, bacteria devoid of such membranes were also seen. Release of outer membrane vesicles (blebs) by internalized P. gingivalis was observed. These results support and extend previous work from this laboratory which demonstrated invasion of a human oral epithelial cell-line (KB) by P. gingivalis.
TI  - Purification of Helicobacter pylori superoxide dismutase and cloning and sequencing of the gene.
AB  - The superoxide dismutase (SOD) of Helicobacter pylori, a pathogenic bacterium which colonizes the gastric mucosa, evoking a marked inflammatory response, was purified and characterized, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. The enzyme consists of two identical subunits each with an apparent molecular weight of 24,000. Analysis of the primary structure and inhibition studies revealed that H. pylori possesses a typical procaryotic iron-containing enzyme. No other isoenzymes could be detected. Indirect gold immunostaining of H. pylori SOD with a polyclonal antibody directed against the iron-containing SOD of Escherichia coli showed a surface-associated localization of the enzyme. The H. pylori SOD gene was cloned by functional complementation of a SOD-deficient E. coli mutant. Sequencing and alignment revealed striking homology to the following facultative intracellular human pathogens: Listeria ivanovii, Listeria monocytogenes, Coxiella burnetti, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Legionella pneumophila, and Entamoeba histolytica. An open reading frame of 642 bp encoding 214 amino acids was determined. There was no leader sequence detectable. Cloning of the H. pylori SOD gene is one of the prerequisites to investigation of its pathophysiological role in the defense against antimicrobial mechanisms of polymorphonuclear granulocytes.
TI  - Proteins with molecular masses of 50 and 80 kilodaltons encoded by genes downstream from the fimbrilin gene (fimA) are components associated with fimbriae in the oral anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Flanking DNA regions of the fimbrilin gene (designated fimA), which encodes the major subunit protein of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis fimbriae, were cloned in several manners from the P. gingivalis chromosome into Escherichia coli by screening with probes derived from a 2.5-kb SacI DNA fragment previously cloned. A total of 10.4 kb of DNA fragments from the P. gingivalis genome was cloned in the pUC plasmid. Expression of the fimA gene and possible flanking genes in the fragments cloned was examined in a pUC plasmid vector system and in a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-promoter expression vector system. The results show that in the pUC plasmid system, a 45-kDa protein, a product of fimA, was only poorly expressed as a precursor of the fimbrilin protein (FimA) and could be detected from cell extracts in Western blotting (immunoblotting) analysis as a sharp band but not in colony immunoblotting analysis. On the other hand, in the T7 RNA polymerase-promoter system, the product of fimA and products of the possible flanking genes responsible for fimbriation were overproduced as thick bands of the 45-kDa protein and as 63-, 50-, and 80-kDa proteins, respectively, in stained electrophoresis gels. All of the recombinant proteins were insoluble and seemed to be expressed as precursors with leader peptides. The 63-kDa, 45-k*Da (a truncated protein of the 50-kDa protein), and 80-kDa proteins were purified after solubilization with sodium dodecyl sulfate. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 45-k*Da and 80-kDa proteins were analyzed up to the first 35 residues with a gas-phase sequencer. Monospecific antibodies directed to the recombinant proteins, i.e., the 63-kDa, 45-k*Da, and 80-kDa proteins, were raised in rabbits. By using the antibodies, localization of their matured proteins in P. gingivalis was investigated by Western blotting analysis. Immunoblotting analysis suggests that at least the 50- and 80-kDa proteins, encoded by genes downstream from the fimA gene, are minor components associated with fimbriae.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequencing of the fimbrilin gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis strains and characterization of recombinant proteins.
AB  - The fimA gene encoding the subunit protein of fimbriae, fimbrilin, from nine strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis was cloned using polymerase chain reaction and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Analysis of the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the fimA gene of the test strains was composed of 1044 to 1083 bp, and the molecular weight of the deduced polypeptides was calculated to be 37,527 to 38,239. All the test strains shared the same or similar sequences, but simultaneously considerable differences in the sequences were found among the strains. Western blot analysis using rabbit antiserum to P. gingivalis 381 fimbriae demonstrated that the recombinant fimbrilins of 8 out of 9 strains expressed in Escherichia coli reacted with the antiserum exhibiting a 43 to 48 kDa band. Taken together, these results indicate that four genetical clusters are noted among the fimA gene of P. gingivalis strains.
TI  - Expression of a functional Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrillin polypeptide in Escherichia coli: purification, physicochemical and immunochemical characterization, and binding characteristics.
AB  - Fimbriae have been reported to play an important role in the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to oral surfaces and possibly in triggering host responses. A structural subunit of the fimbriae, fimbrillin, has been shown to be important in binding of the bacterium to saliva-coated oral surfaces. In the present study, a coding region of the fimbrillin gene from P. gingivalis 2561 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pET-11d vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The expressed protein was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies after solubilization with urea and gel filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant fimbrillin polypeptide, r-fim 10-337, corresponded to amino acid residues 10 to 337 of the deduced amino acid sequence of fimbrillin. In immunoblot analysis, r-fim 10-337 reacted with antibodies to fimbrillin purified from P. gingivalis, as well as with antibodies to synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of fimbrillin. The apparent molecular mass of r-fim 10-337 was estimated to be 41 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The r-fim 10-337 polypeptide was capable of inhibiting the binding of P. gingivalis 2561 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads. These results suggest that the fimbrillin subunit polypeptide plays an important role in binding of P. gingivalis cells to saliva-coated surfaces. We describe here the successful expression and purification of a functionally and immunologically reactive recombinant P. gingivalis fimbrillin subunit from E. coli.
TI  - Characterization of recombinant and native forms of a cell surface antigen of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis.
AB  - The cloning of genes encoding putative cell surface antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 has been reported previously (B. C. McBride, A. Joe, and U. Singh, Arch. Oral Biol. 55:59S-68S, 1990). This study characterizes the recombinant protein rPgAg1, which is highly expressed in clone BA3, and the corresponding 51-kDa native antigen PgAg1. Cellular localization studies with monospecific antibodies to rPgAg1 in a Western immunoblot assay of a P. gingivalis membrane fraction and immunogold labeling of intact P. gingivalis cells confirmed the cell surface location of the native PgAg1 molecule. The pgag1 gene was found to be present in all four strains of P. gingivalis examined, and the gene product was expressed. Highly homologous DNA sequences and immunologically related proteins, however, were not detected in related species in the group formerly known as black-pigmented Bacteroides. This suggests that PgAg1 is specific to P. gingivalis and is highly conserved within this species. A protein data base search with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of rPgAg1 did not identify any significantly similar protein sequences. The high level of expression of rPgAg1 was not dependent on the insertional orientation of the cloned fragment. It therefore appears that a P. gingivalis promoter is present which is well recognized by the transcriptional apparatus of the Escherichia coli cloning host. The promoter element and structural gene for a specific cell surface antigen of P. gingivalis have been cloned.
TI  - Genetic transformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis by electroporation.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis was transformed by electroporation using the DNA of plasmid pE5-2, or its derivative, pYT7. Prior to transformation, pE5-2 was transferred from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis strains by conjugation (mobilization with R751), and the plasmid DNA was purified from the P. gingivalis transconjugants. Transformation occurred when the recipient strain and the donor strain from which the plasmid DNA was purified were homologous. If they were heterologous, transformation did not take place or did so at a very low frequency. This suggested that a restriction-modification system is present in P. gingivalis strains. Plasmid pYT7 was derived by removing an 8.0 kb AvaI fragment from pE5-2 that was purified from P. gingivalis cells. It has several single-cutting restriction sites such as EcoRI, AvaI and ClaI usable for gene cloning, though it was not stable enough in P. gingivalis cells, probably because the rep gene was derived from a relatively distant species, Bacteroides eggerthii.
TI  - Cloning of two distinct hemolysin genes from Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Hemolysin is considered a potent virulence factor in a large number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. The hemolysin produced by the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis functions to provide the cell with its required heme-containing molecules for growth in the periodontal pocket. Two distinct P. gingivalis genes, each of which confers a hemolytic phenotype in Escherichia coli, were isolated by screening genomic DNA libraries of P. gingivalis on sheep blood agar plates. The results obtained from physical maps and Southern blots indicated a considerable degree of divergence in the nucleotide sequences of these two genes. Maxicell analyses of the recombinant plasmids in E. coli suggested that plasmid pPGH5 encoded a polypeptide of molecular weight 48 kDa, while an 18-kDa polypeptide was obtained with pPGH1 and pPGH7. When E. coli harboring these hemolysin genes were subjected to iron starvation, the levels of hemolysin activity increased. Biochemical characterization of hemolytic activities indicated that the activity of both hemolysins was inhibited by Mg2+ and Ca2+; but not by EDTA. Elevated levels of hemolytic activity were obtained from the E. coli recombinant strains in the presence of glutathione, DTT and 2-mercaptoethanol. Cholesterol inhibited the activity.
TI  - Intra- and inter-individual comparison of Porphyromonas gingivalis genotypes.
AB  - Genetic analysis of 31 clinical strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis isolated from nine subjects, 2-6 strains per subject, was performed by Southern hybridization. Chromosomal DNA was extracted by the method of Moncla et al. [1] and digested to completion with restriction endonucleases PstI, ClaI and BglI. The DNA fragments were separated electrophoretically on agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized to the non-radioactively labelled plasmid pKK 3535 which contains the rmB ribosomal RNA operon of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Of the three enzymes, BglI was the most suitable for the genetic analysis of P. gingivalis. With this enzyme, the intra-individual strains were shown to be identical in eight of the nine subjects, whereas inter-individual strains were different.
TI  - Generation and purification of recombinant fimbrillin from Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis 381.
AB  - Fimbrillin is the major subunit protein of fimbriae from the human periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis. We describe here the generation and initial characterization of recombinant fimbrillin (r-fimbrillin) isolated from P. gingivalis 381. A fragment of DNA encoding the gene for fimbrillin was generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the expression vector pET11b. Plasmids containing the recombinant gene were transfected into Escherichia coli. Clones were selected on plates for ampicillin resistance and individually screened by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for protein production after activation with IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D- thiogalactopyranoside). One clone, OW0.2, produced significant amounts of a 42-kDa protein after induction with IPTG. This clone contained the pET11b plasmid with a 1-kb insert that had sequence homology to the gene encoding fimbrillin. The majority of recombinant protein from clone OW0.2 was found in the cytoplasm within inclusion bodies. Protein aggregates were solubilized in 8 M urea, and SDS-PAGE analysis showed two major protein bands, one at 42 kDa and the other at 17 kDa. These two proteins coeluted from a DEAE-Sepharose column at 0.15 M NaCl and were reactive to rabbit antiserum to fimbrillin in a Western blot (immunoblot). A preparation giving a single protein band at 42 kDa in SDS-PAGE was obtained by size fractionation by using continuous-elution electrophoresis. Lymph node cells from animals immunized with either fimbrillin from P. gingivalis or r-fimbrillin showed antigen-specific proliferation to both P. gingivalis fimbrillin and r-fimbrillin in an in vitro recall assay. Therefore, it appears that r-fimbrillin is chemically, antigenically, and serologically identical to fimbrillin isolated from P. gingivalis 381.
TI  - Purification of a fibroblast-inhibitory factor from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4.
AB  - A factor showing inhibitory activity against human gingival fibroblasts was extracted from the cytosol fraction of Actinobacillus actinomycetemocimitans Y4. The activity markedly inhibited the proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts, but had no effect on cell viability or gross morphology. No such activity was found in cytosol fractions from either Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 or Escherichia coli HB101. The extract from A. actinomycetemocomitans Y4 was then purified by anion-exchange chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography to give a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa. The purification ratio was 183-fold with a recovery rate of 5% compared with the crude extract (starting material) when the activity was assessed by direct cell counts.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis prtT gene, coding  for protease activity.
AB  - The prtT gene, coding for trypsinlike proteolytic activity, has been isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53977. This gene is present immediately downstream from the sod gene on a 5.9-kb DNA fragment from the organism isolated in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme corresponds to a 53.9-kDa protein with an estimated pI of 11.85. Gelatin-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography also indicated a similar molecular size for the protease. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity following anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme also exhibited a single protein species with a size of approximately 53 kDa. Enzyme activity was strongly dependent upon the presence of reducing agents (dithiothreitol, cysteine, and 2-mercaptoethanol) and was also stimulated in the presence of calcium ions. A comparison of the properties of the prtT gene product with comparable parameters of proteases previously purified from different strains of P. gingivalis suggested that the cloned protease represents a previously uncharacterized enzyme.
TI  - Expression of Porphyromonas gingivalis proteolytic activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly Bacteroides gingivalis) degrades numerous protein substrates including collagen, fibrinogen, fibronectin, gelatin, casein, immunoglobulins and complement components. In order to clone one or more of these protease genes, a genomic library was constructed with Sau3A1 restriction fragments of chromosomal DNA from P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 ligated into the temperature-regulated vector pCQV2, and expressed in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha mcr. The electro-transformants (3 x 10(4)) were screened for general protease activity on Luria broth agar containing ampicillin (50 mg/l) and sodium caseinate (2%). One casein-hydrolyzing clone was detected and subcultured, and the activity of the cell extracts was characterized. We were able to show that the protease-positive clone, (pTEM1), had broad substrate specificity. Colorimetric assays indicated the hydrolysis of azocoll, azocasein, collagen, elastin-congo red and artificial substrates. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm that collagen, casein, fibrinogen and fibronectin were degraded by the clone.
TI  - Cloning of the gene encoding a glycylprolyl aminopeptidase from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - A genomic library of Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was constructed in the cosmid vector pHC79. A clone, pSN1, was identified by the expression of glycylprolyl-naphthylamide hydrolysing activity. The DNA insert contained within the cosmid pSN1 was subcloned into the plasmid vector pBR328 to create the recombinant plasmid pSN11 containing a 2.9 kb EcoRV insert. An Escherichia coli transformant containing pSN11 produced a protein having a molecular weight of 75 kDa. Southern-blot hybridization revealed that the 2.9 kb EcoRV DNA hybridized with an identical sized Eco RV DNA fragment in the chromosomal DNA of P. gingivalis 381.
TI  - Direct and indirect effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide on interleukin-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - We examined the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by human gingival fibroblasts  (ATCC CRL 1292) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli, or supernatant of human peripheral blood adherent cell culture medium incubated in the presence of IL-1 and the same two LPS. Confluent monolayers of gingival fibroblasts were incubated with stimulants for 6 h at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and air. After removal of stimulants, the cell cultures were incubated for an additional 2 or 24 h in the same environment. At the end of the culture period, supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-6 activity by stimulatory IgG production with the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line CESS. The direct effect of LPS on IL-6 production by gingival fibroblasts was much weaker than the indirect one via IL-1 production by adherent cells. The stimulating effect of culture supernatants of adherent cells stimulated with LPS on IL-6 production by gingival fibroblasts was as effective as that of recombinant IL-1, when this latter was added at a concentration equivalent to that contained in the culture supernatant of adherent cells. These results suggest that, although gingival fibroblasts may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontal disease by the production of cytokines, such a role may not result from a direct stimulation by periodontopathic bacteria. The phenomenon is more likely to be mediated indirectly by IL-1 produced by infiltrating inflammatory cells.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and sequencing of a protease gene (tpr) from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a highly proteolytic organism which metabolizes small peptides and amino acids. Indirect evidence suggests that the proteases produced by this microorganism constitute an important virulence factor. In this study, a gene bank of P. gingivalis W83 DNA was constructed by cloning 0.5- to 20-kb HindIII-cut DNA fragments into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha by using the plasmid vector pUC19. A clone expressing a protease from P. gingivalis was isolated on LB agar containing 1% skim milk. The clone contained a 3.0-kb insert that coded for a protease with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa. Sequencing part of the 3.0-kb DNA fragment revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein of 482 amino acids with a molecular mass of 62.5 kDa. Putative promoter and termination elements flanking the open reading frame were identified. The activity expressed in E. coli was extensively characterized by using various substrates and protease inhibitors, and the results suggest that it is possibly a thiol protease.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid and transposon DNA from Escherichia coli into Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Using the broad host-range vector R751 to provide transfer functions, plasmid pVAL-1 and transposon Tn4351 were conjugally mobilized from Escherichia coli into Porphyromonas gingivalis. Transfer frequencies for both elements varied between 10(-6) and 10(-11), depending upon the recipient. The behavior of pVAL-1 and Tn4351 in P. gingivalis was essentially as described previously in Bacteroides spp. These data indicate that plasmid and transposon DNA can be conjugally transferred into P. gingivalis and that these elements can be used to genetically manipulate the organism in examining putative virulence determinants that may participate in the induction or exacerbation of periodontal disease.
TI  - Gene cloning of Porphyromonas gingivalis specific antigens recognized by serum of adult periodontitis patient.
AB  - 1. Porphyromonas gingivalis is believed an important pathogen of adult periodontitis. A gene library of P. gingivalis 381 was constructed in lambda phage vector L47.1. The library was probed with serum obtained from patients of severe adult periodontitis. Two clones, lambda MDBG101 and lambda MDBG103 which were expressed, 200 and 160 kDa respectively, were selected and further studied. 2. The expressed antigens in these two clones were also reacted with rabbit antiserum against whole cells, capsular fraction and cell surface fraction of P. gingivalis. 3. Genes coding protein antigens in lambda MDBG101 and lambda MDBG103 were subcloned into high-copy-number plasmid vector pACYC184 and subclones obtained were designated as MD101 and MD103. Recombinant plasmids, pMD101 and pMD103, differed in their restriction endonuclease digestion. 4. Immunodiffusion analysis showed that cloned proteins from MD101 and MD103 reacted with antiserum against P. gingivalis but did not react with antiserum against Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella asaccharolyticus. 5. These data suggest that P. gingivalis species-specific antigens has been successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Since these cloned specific antigens were recognized by adult periodontitis patient sera, the recombinant antigen will be useful material for the development of serodiagnosis of P. gingivalis infection in adults periodontitis.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis prtC gene, which expresses a novel collagenase activity.
AB  - In order to examine the potential role of bacterial collagenases in periodontal tissue destruction, we recently isolated a gene, prtC, from Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53977, which expressed collagenase activity (N. Takahashi, T. Kato, and H. K. Kuramitsu, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 84:135-138, 1991). The nucleotide sequence of the gene has been determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to a basic protein of 37.8 kDa. In addition, Southern blot analysis indicated that the prtC gene is conserved among the three major serotypes of P. gingivalis. The enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity from Escherichia coli clone NTS1 following Mono Q anion exchange and sequential gel filtration chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be ca. 35 kDa, and the active enzyme behaved as a dimer following gel filtration chromatography. The collagenase degraded soluble and reconstituted fibrillar type I collagen, heat-denatured type I collagen, and azocoll but not gelatin or the synthetic collagenase substrate 4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Arg. Enzyme activity was enhanced by Ca2+ and inhibited by EDTA, sulfhydryl-blocking agents, and the salivary peptide histatin. Preliminary evidence for the existence of a second collagenase expressed by strain 53977 was also obtained.
TI  - The introduction of colonic-Bacteroides shuttle plasmids into Porphyromonas gingivalis: identification of a putative P. gingivalis insertion-sequence element.
AB  - Two Escherichia coli-Bacteroides plasmid-shuttle vectors pNJR5 and pNJR12 were introduced for the first time into Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 by conjugal transfer from E. coli. The transfer frequencies were comparable to those obtained when using colonic Bacteroides as recipients. Both plasmids were maintained in P. gingivalis W83 and could be isolated and introduced back into E. coli. Plasmid DNA extracted from one P. gingivalis W83 pNJR12 transconjugant had an additional 1.5 kb of inserted DNA. Southern-blot analysis of P. gingivalis W83 chromosomal DNA using this inserted DNA as a probe revealed the presence of multiple copies of this sequence on the chromosome. We propose that this DNA represents a P. gingivalis insertion sequence (IS) element and should be referred to as IS1126. This is the first IS element to be isolated from a Gram-negative oral anaerobic bacterium.
TI  - Transposition of Tn4351 in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Genetic analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis, an obligately anaerobic gram-negative bacterium, has been hindered by the apparent lack of naturally occurring bacteriophages, transposable elements, and plasmids. Plasmid R751::*omega 4 has previously been used as a suicide vector to demonstrate transposition of Tn4351 in B. uniformis. The erythromycin resistance gene on Tn4351 functions in Bacteroides and Porphyromonas. Erythromycin-resistant transconjugants were obtained at a mean frequency of 1.6 x 10(-7) from matings between Escherichia coli HB101 containing R751::*omega 4 and P. gingivalis 33277. Southern blot hybridization analysis indicated that about half of the erythromycin-resistant P. gingivalis transconjugants contained simple insertions of Tn4351 and half contained both Tn4351 and R751 sequences. The presence of R751 sequences in some P. gingivalis transconjugants most likely occurred from Tn4351-mediated cointegration of R751, since we were unable to detect autonomous plasmid in these P. gingivalis transconjugants. The P. gingivalis-Tn4351 DNA junction fragments from different transconjugants varied in size. These results are consistent with transposition of Tn4351 and with insertion at several different locations in the P. gingivalis chromosome. Tn4351 may be useful as a mutagen to isolate well-defined mutants of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of a major surface protein (the 75-kDa protein)  of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A major immunodominant surface protein (the 75-kDa protein) of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis 381 has been purified and its amino-terminal amino acid sequence has been determined. Using oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the sequence, we identified a recombinant plasmid clone carrying a single 4.2-kb BamHI fragment from pUC19 libraries of P. gingivalis. The BamHI fragment transferred to the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase/promoter expression vector system produced a slightly larger (77-kDa) protein, a precursor form, immunoreactive to the antibody against the 75-kDa protein, suggesting that the cloned DNA fragment probably carried an entire gene for the 75-kDa protein. Genomic Southern analysis revealed a single copy of the 75-kDa protein gene per genome among all P. gingivalis strains tested, and that no homologous genes are present in other black-pigmented Bacteroides species. These observations suggest that the 75-kDa protein gene may be useful as a specific DNA probe to classify or to detect this organism.
TI  - Isolation and preliminary characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis prtC gene expressing collagenase activity.
AB  - A gene, prtC, has been isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53977 in Escherichia coli utilizing the plasmid vector pPL-lambda. The resultant protease positive clone NHS1, harboring plasmid pS1 with a 5.9-kilobase P. gingivalis insert, expressed an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the synthetic collagenase substrate PZ-PLGPA as well as solubilized type I collagen. Subcloning and deletion analysis located the prtC gene at one end of the P. gingivalis DNA insert on plasmid pS1.
TI  - Roles of porphyrins and host iron transport proteins in regulation of growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis W50.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis) requires iron in the form of hemin for growth and virulence in vitro, but the contributions of the porphyrin ring structure, porphyrin-associated iron, host hemin-sequestering molecules, and host iron-withholding proteins to its survival are unknown. Therefore, the effects of various porphyrins, host iron transport proteins, and inorganic iron sources on the growth of P. gingivalis W50 were examined to delineate the various types of iron molecules used for cellular metabolism. Cell envelope-associated hemin and iron stores contributed to the growth of P. gingivalis in hemin-free culture, and depletion of these endogenous reserves required eight serial transfers into hemin-free medium for total suppression of growth. Comparable growth of P. gingivalis was observed with 7.7 microM equivalents of hemin as hemoglobin (HGB), methemoglobin, myoglobin, hemin-saturated serum albumin, lactoperoxidase, cytochrome c, and catalase. Unrestricted growth was recorded in the presence of haptoglobin-HGB and hemopexin-hemin complexes, indicating that these host defense proteins do not sequester HGB and hemin from P. gingivalis. The iron chelator 2,2'-bipyridyl functionally chelated hemin-associated iron, resulting in dose-dependent inhibition of growth in hemin-restricted cultures at 1 to 25 microM 2,2'-bipyridyl concentrations. In the absence of an exogenous iron source, protoporphyrin IX did not support P. gingivalis growth. These findings suggest that the iron atom in the hemin molecule is the critical constituent for growth and that the tetrapyrrole porphyrin ring structure may represent an important vehicle for delivery of iron into the P. gingivalis cell. P. gingivalis does not have a strict requirement for porphyrins, since growth occurred with nonhemin iron sources, including high concentrations (200 muM) of ferric, ferrous, and nitrogenous inorganic iron, and P. gingivalis exhibited unrestricted growth in the presence of host transferrin, lactoferrin, and serum albumin. The diversity of iron substrates utilized by P. gingivalis and the observation that growth was not affected by the bacteriostatic effects of host iron-withholding proteins, which it may encounter in the periodontal pocket, may explain why P. gingivalis is such a formidable pathogen in the periodontal disease process.
TI  - Identification and sequence analysis of a methylase gene in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - A gene from the periodontal organism Porphyromonas gingivalis has been identified as encoding a DNA methylase. The gene, referred to as pgiIM, has been sequenced and found to contain a reading frame of 864 basepairs. The putative amino acid sequence of the encoded methylase was 288 amino acids, and shared 47% and 31% homology with the Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII and E. coli Dam methylases, respectively. The activity and specificity of the pgi methylase (M.PgiI) was confirmed by cloning the gene into a dam- strain of E. coli (JM110) and performing a restriction analysis on the isolated DNA with enzymes whose activities depended upon the methylation state of the DNA. The data indicated that M.PgiI, like DpnII and Dam, methylated the adenine residue within the sequence 5'-GATC-3'.
TI  - Adherence to experimental pellicle of rough-type lipopolysaccharides from subgingival plaque bacteria.
AB  - The adherence of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from periodontal disease-associated bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA) and serum-coated HA beads was examined by chromogenic Limulus activity (toxicolor test). Phenol-water extracted LPS preparations from Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and rough-type LPS from Escherichia coli adhered to S-HA and serum-coated beads and agglutinated human erythrocytes. The adhered LPSs to S-HA and serum-coated HA beads were not removed by vigorous washing with distilled water. LPSs from Bacteroides (Porphyromonas) gingivalis strains and wild-type E. coli did not adhere to S-HA, serum-coated HA beads or show hemagglutinating activity. SDS-PAGE patterns stained with silver stain showed that LPSs adhered to S-HA, and serum-coated HA beads and erythrocytes possessed a distinct fast-migrating band similar to rough-type LPS. B. gingivalis LPSs possessed slow-migrating and repeating ladder bands similar to wild-type LPS.
TI  - Isolation, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the sod gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The sod gene coding for the Mn/Fe-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme has been isolated on a 5.9-kb DNA fragment from Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53977. SOD activity can be expressed from the P. gingivalis fragment and from a subcloned fragment in Escherichia coli. However, the enzyme does not appear to be expressed from its own promoter in E. coli cells. The nucleotide sequence of the gene has been determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme is nearly identical to that of the enzyme purified from P. gingivalis 381 and shares extensive sequence similarity with comparable enzymes from E. coli.
TI  - Purification and immunochemical characterization of a recombinant outer membrane  protein from Bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  - 1. Bacteroides gingivalis is thought to be one of the most virulent microorganisms in relation to adult periodontitis. A gene clone, MD125, is an Escherichia coli host which produces an outer membrane protein of B. gingivalis. 2. The recombinant outer membrane protein (rOMP) was purified to homogeneity from cell sonicate of MD125 by four chromatographic steps. The molecular weight of the purified rOMP was estimated to be approximately 40 kDa. 3. Immunodiffusion analysis showed that antiserum against whole cells of B. gingivalis reacted not only with B. gingivalis cells but also with other Bacteroides cells. Antiserum against the purified recombinant protein reacted with cells of B. gingivalis, whereas this antiserum did not react with all of the other Bacteroides species tested. 4. These data suggest that the rOMP may be a B. gingivalis-specific antigen and that the purified rOMP will be useful material for serodiagnosis and for the development of a vaccine against B. gingivalis infection.
TI  - Monoclonal antibody-coated latex agglutination assay for identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to lipopolysaccharide of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4 (serotype b) and eight MAbs to a serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen of strain Y4 were obtained. Latex particles sensitized with an MAb to the Y4 lipopolysaccharide produced a positive agglutination with whole cells of all three serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, but not with Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, "Bacteroides" intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli. On the other hand, latex particles sensitized with an MAb to the serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen agglutinated with whole cells of serotype b A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, but not with heated and trypsinized cells of P. gingivalis. The simple and rapid latex agglutination assay using MAbs may be useful for the identification of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - The RNA polymerases of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Western blot analysis that used antisera to the E. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the RNA polymerase of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Both antisera reacted with proteins in A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. mutans whole-cell extracts. Reactions were seen with some F. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core RNA polymerase antisera were used, but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. No reaction with F. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to E. coli sigma factor. There were no cross-reacting proteins detected in P. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. These results suggest that E. coli RNA polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase for E. coli RNA polymerase to recognize P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum promoters. Partially purified P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase exhibited a specificity for a P. gingivalis DNA template, while having a decreased activity from an E. coli DNA template. The antibiotic sensitivity profile of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of E. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. We conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum genes in E. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.
TI  - Characterization and physical mapping of plasmids of black-pigmented Bacteroides.
AB  - Eight species of black-pigmented Bacteroides (BPB) were examined for plasmid content. Three classes of plasmids with molecular sizes of 16.0 kilobase (kb), 5.4 kb and 5.0 kb were found in 7 of 125 Bacteroides intermedius strains. One strain each of Porphyromonas (former Bacteroides) asaccharolyticus and of Bacteroides levii were also shown to have plasmids. However, no plasmids were detected in 90 strains of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis. The plasmids were purified and digested with restriction endonucleases for restriction mapping. The maps obtained in this study have given us information on the scheme of constructing recombinants which may be usable as shuttle vectors, by the recombination of BPB and Escherichia coli plasmids.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis protease gene  in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A genomic library of Bacteroides gingivalis W83 chromosomal DNA was constructed in the Escherichia coli lambda (lambda) vector EMBL 4. Three recombinant lambda phages expressing a cloned protease were identified in the library. All three lambda phages contained cloned overlapping DNA fragments from the same region of the chromosome and encoded the same cloned protease. The cloned protease was expressed poorly using its own promoter in E. coli.
TI  - Bacteroides-specific IgG and IgA subclass antibody-secreting cells isolated from  chronically inflamed gingival tissues.
AB  - The emergence of cells that produce IgG and IgA subclass antibodies to Bacteroides gingivalis (Porphyromonas gingivalis) fimbriae and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens was examined in mononuclear cells isolated from inflamed gingiva of different stages (slight, moderate or advanced) of adult periodontitis (AP). Antigen-specific IgM, IgG (including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) and IgA (including IgA1 and IgA2) producing cells were enumerated by the ELISPOT assay and were compared with total Ig-producing cells of each isotype or subclass. In advanced AP, the B. gingivalis fimbriae-specific IgG- and IgA-secreting cells represented 5% of total IgG- or IgA-secreting cells, while those from the moderate stage comprised approximately 1% of these two isotypes. Cells producing antibody specific for B. gingivalis LPS were observed at frequencies of 0.1% and 0.4% for IgG and IgA cells, respectively in the advanced stage. When IgG subclasses were analysed in moderate AP, the anti-fimbriae subclass responses were largely IgG1 (60%), followed by IgG2 (20%), IgG3 (10%) and IgG4 (10%). Fimbriae-specific IgG subclass responses were elevated in the advanced stage of AP, and IgG4 (40%) and IgG1 (30%) were dominant, followed by IgG3 (20%) and IgG2 (10%). IgA1 cells predominated in both the moderate and advanced stages, however a relative increase in IgA2 cells occurred in advanced AP. Mononuclear cells isolated from gingiva of AP patients did not contain cells producing antibody to antigens such as Escherichia coli K235 LPS, cholera toxin or the hapten dinitrophenyl coupled to bovine serum albumin. These results show that local IgG and IgA subclass responses occur to a protein antigen of a major periodontal disease (PD)-associated pathogen, B. gingivalis, and the increase in IgG4 and IgA2 responses may be associated with host protection.
