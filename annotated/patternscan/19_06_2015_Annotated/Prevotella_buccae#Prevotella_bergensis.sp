TI  == prevotella bergensis sp. nov., isolated from human infections.
AB  == eight strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from infections of the  skin and soft tissues were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed the strains to constitute a homogeneous group, distinct from species with validly published names but related to a cluster including prevotella buccae, prevotella dentalis and prevotella baroniae. a novel species, prevotella bergensis sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella bergensis is saccharolytic and  produces acetic and succinic acids as end products of fermentation. the g + c content of the dna of the type strain is 48 mol%. the type strain of prevotella bergensis is 94067913t (= dsm 17361t = ccug 51224t).
