TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == numerical survey of some bacterial taxa.
AB  == focht, d. d. (iowa state university, ames), and w. r. lockhart. numerical survey  of some bacterial taxa. j. bacteriol. 90:1314-1319. 1965.-a numerical analysis was made of 77 properties of each of 43 bacterial strains, representing 25 genera from 8 families in the orders eubacteriales and pseudomonadales. four major groups were found, related to one another at approximately the same level of similarity: (1) a large cluster containing the subgroups (1a) athiorhodaceae-spirillaceae, (1b) xanthomonas, and (1c) "inactive" micrococcaceae-achromobacteraceae; (2) a cluster containing the "active" micrococcaceae and lactobacillaceae; (3) the enterobacteria; and (4) aeromonas. there was a sharp distinction between the branches of groups 1a, 1c, and 2. the composition of groups was essentially the same whether or not fermentation of carbohydrates (28 characters) was included in the analysis. several individual strains, notably, bacillus subtilis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and erwinia amylovora, were related to none of the groups, and others (two species of proteus, flavobacterium devorans, and lactobacillus casei) showed only minimal quantitative relationships with their groups. these results suggest  that there may be significant variation in levels of similarity within microbial  groups presently accorded equivalent taxonomic rank, and that some present distinctions among taxa, particularly at the generic level, cannot be confirmed on the basis of overall similarity.
