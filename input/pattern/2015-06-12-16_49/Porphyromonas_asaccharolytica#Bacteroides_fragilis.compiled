TI  - Distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. The evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. In particular, 16S rDNA-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. Here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection and osteomyelitis. The chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. Culture and DHPLC revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. The analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely Gemella morbillorum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. The diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. However, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.
TI  - Cytokine release and expression induced by OmpA proteins from the Gram-negative anaerobes, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - OmpA proteins from Gram-negative anaerobes Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Bacteroides fragilis induced release and expression of IL-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10 from murine splenocytes in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion. The release of the cytokines induced by B. fragilis Bf-OmpA was at much lower levels compared with P. asaccharolytica Omp-PA; Bf-OmpA did not induce release of IL-10. Omp-PA and Bf-OmpA were able to upregulate mRNA expression of the tested cytokines. The results obtained with refolded Bf-OmpA were similar to those with native Bf-OmpA. The data presented in this research demonstrate for the first time that Omps from anaerobic bacteria can induce the release of cytokines, suggesting that Omp-PA and Bf-OmpA may play important roles in the pathogenic processes of these bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - Review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - Published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. The studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. Using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against Gram-positive anaerobes (Clostridium perfringens, all Peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against Gram-negative anaerobes. Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides tectum and many Bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/L, while the other species of the B. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. Species variability was evident: Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas macaccae, Prevotella heparinolytica and Prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/L of gemifloxacin while most other Porphyromonas and Prevotella spp. were not. These data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which Gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. may predominate.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Absence of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis and Chlamydia pneumoniae in human subgingival plaque.
AB  - Little is known about the presence of common medical pathogens in the human oral  cavity. Using a 16S rRNA-based PCR identification method, this study determined the occurrence of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis and Chlamydia pneumoniae in subgingival plaque from 50 adults with advanced periodontitis. Each patient contributed samples from 3 deep periodontal pockets collected by paper points. The PCR primers were for P. asaccharolytica 5'-CTC TAG CTA GAG TGT ACT GG-3' and 5'-ATA GGG TTT ATA GAT TAG CTC TCT-3', for B. fragilis 5'-AAT GAT TCC GCA TGG TTT CAT TA-3' and 5'-GCG GTG ATT GCT CAC TGA CA-3', and for C. pneumoniae 5'- TGA CAA CTG TAG AAA TAC AGC-3' and 5'-CGC CTC TCT CCT ATA AAT-3'. The primers yielded a single amplicon with the respective reference strains and produced no amplicon with colonies of 25 groups of oral organisms. None of the three test species were detected in any of the 50 pooled subgingival samples tested. P. asaccharyolytica, B. fragilis and C. pneumoniae do not seem to be part of the periodontopathic microbiota in humans.
TI  - A study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  - Semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. The number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. Standard methods were used for the investigations. Five main genera of anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all patients. They included, the Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including Prevotella bivia, P. disiens, P. melanogenica, P. asaccharolytica and B. fragilis. The predominant flora was P. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. The semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). Similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - The in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: Bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), Bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), Bacteroides vulgatus (5 strains), Bacteroides spp. (15 strains), Prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), Mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), Peptococcus niger (3 strains), Peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), Peptococcus spp (30 strains), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and Propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in Wilkins-Chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in an atmosphere of 10% H2, 10% CO2, 80% N2. All the drugs tested exert their activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic isolates. In particular, trospectomycin is quite active against Gram-positive cocci (MIC 90 = 4 - 8 mg/l), Gram-negative rods (MIC 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), Gram-positive rods (MIC 90 = 4 mg/l) and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC 90 = 0.5 mg/l).
TI  - Prevotella and Porphyromonas infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1994, 504 isolates of Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were obtained from 435 (21%) of 2033 specimens from 418 children. They included 160 (32%) Pr. melaninogenica, 105 (21%) Pr. intermedia, 84 (17%) P. asaccharolytica, 58 (12%) Pr. orisbuccae, and 58 (12%) Pr. oralis. Most Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were isolated from abscesses (176), pulmonary infections (85), ear infections (82), wound infections (44), peritonitis (38), paronychia (15) and chronic sinusitis (14). Predisposing conditions were noted in 111 (27%) of the cases; these included previous surgery in 41 (10%), foreign body in 36 (9%), neurological deficiencies in 29 (7%), immunodeficiency in 21 (5%), steroid therapy in 12 (4%), diabetes in 8 (2%) and malignancy in 7 (2%). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were the only isolates in 14 (3%) patients, and mixed infection was encountered in 404 (97%). The micro-organisms most commonly isolated with Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were anaerobic cocci (393 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (108), Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (95), Escherichia coli (56) and other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (52). Most Bacteroides spp. and E. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections around the rectal area, whereas most Fusobacterium spp. were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck sites. beta-Lactamase production was detected in 191 (38%) Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates from all body sites. All patients received antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage was performed in 173 (41%) cases. Four patients died from their infection. These data illustrate the spectrum and importance of Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in infections in children.
TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
