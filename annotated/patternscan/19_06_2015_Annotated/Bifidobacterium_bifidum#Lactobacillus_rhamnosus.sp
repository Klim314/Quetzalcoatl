TI  == perioperative synbiotics decrease postoperative complications in periampullary neoplasms: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == periampullary neoplasms are rapidly progressive tumors with a poor prognosis and  high morbidity and mortality rates, which have a negative influence on patient outcomes. some probiotics and prebiotics have the ability to protect the intestinal barrier and prevent bacterial translocation, infection, and postoperative complications. we evaluated the use of synbiotics in a prospective, double-blind study of patients undergoing surgery for periampullary neoplasms (pns) and assessed the effect of these agents on nutritional status, postoperative complications, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and mortality. patients were randomized to receive probiotics and prebiotics-synbiotics--group s [lactobacillus acidophilus 10, 1 x 10(9)cfu, lactobacillus rhamnosus hs 111, 1 x 10(9) cfu, lactobacillus casei 10, 1 x 10(9)  cfu, bifidobacterium bifidum, 1 x 10(9)cfu, and fructooligosaccharides (fos) 100  mg]--or placebo-controls--group c, twice daily, for a total of 14 days. risk, clinical status, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. twenty-three patients were allocated to each group. the incidence of postoperative infection was significantly lower in group s (6 of 23 patients, 26.1%) than in group c (16  of 23 patients, 69.6%) (p = 0.00). duration of antibiotic therapy was also shorter in group s (mean = 9 days vs. 15 days in group c; p = 0.01). noninfectious complications were less common in group s (6 of 23 vs. 14 of 23 patients in group c; p = 0.03). mean length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 5 days in group s vs. 23 +/- 14 days in group c (p = 0.00). no deaths occurred in group s,  whereas 6 deaths occurred in group c (p = 0.02). perioperative administration of  synbiotics reduces postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for pns.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == a multispecies probiotic reduces oral candida colonization in denture wearers.
AB  == purpose: the prevalence of candida infections has been rising with an increasingly aging population and a larger population of immunocompromised individuals. the use of probiotics may be an alternative approach to antifungal agents in the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis. this study aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of probiotics in reducing the infection level of oral candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers. materials and methods: in a double-blind randomized study, 59 denture wearers harboring candida spp. in the oral cavity with no clinical symptoms were allocated into two groups: probiotic and placebo. all patients were instructed to clean the denture daily. the probiotic group poured a capsule containing lyophilized lactobacillus rhamnosus hs111, lactobacillus acidophillus hs101, and bifidobacterium bifidum daily on the palatal surface of the maxillary denture, whereas the placebo group  was submitted to the same regimen using placebo capsules. candida spp. infection  levels were evaluated in palate mucosa samples obtained before and after a 5-week experimental period. results: all patients harbored candida in the palate mucosa  at baseline. fifty-five individuals completed the experimental period. the detection rate of candida spp. was 92.0% in the placebo group after the experimental period, whereas it was reduced to 16.7% in the probiotic group. the  reduction promoted by the probiotic regimen was independent of baseline characteristics such as candida infection level and colonizing species, age of denture, and other variables. conclusion: the probiotic product was effective in  reducing the colonization of the oral cavity with candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers, suggesting that this multispecies probiotic could be used to prevent oral candidiasis. clinical implications: colonization of oral surfaces by candida is considered a risk factor for invasive fungal infections. the use of a product with l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, and b. bifidum may represent an alternative treatment for reduction  of candida infections in elderly denture wearers.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == cohort study of probiotics in a north american neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine whether routine probiotic administration to very preterm  infants would reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) without adverse consequences. study design: since the end of july 2011, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of <32 weeks' gestation. we give 0.5 g of a mixture of 4 bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium breve, bifidum, infantis, and longum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus ha-111 [corrected] (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) per day, starting with the first feed, until the infant reaches 34 weeks. we compared complications among infants admitted during the first 17 months of routine use with those admitted during the previous 17 months. results: two hundred ninety-four infants received probiotics, and 317 infants formed the comparison group. introduction of probiotics was associated with a reduction in nec (from 9.8% to 5.4%, p < .02), a nonsignificant decrease in death (9.8% to 6.8%), and a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or nec (from 17% to 10.5%, p < .05). after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and sex, the improvements remained significant (or for nec, 0.51; 95% ci, 0.26-0.98; or for death or nec, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.33-0.93). there was no effect of probiotics on health care-associated infection. discussion: a product that is readily available in north america, that has excellent quality control, and that contains strains similar to those that have been shown effective in randomized controlled trials substantially reduced the frequency of nec in our neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background and aim: the efficacy of treatment with multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) symptoms and the alterations of gut microbiota in  patients who have taken probiotics were investigated. methods: this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 49 ibs patients (probiotics: 25,  placebo: 24) diagnosed according to the rome iii criteria. patients were randomly assigned to two groups: either to receive multispecies probiotics (a mixture of bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus) twice a day for 4 weeks or to receive  a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. the primary efficacy end-point was the proportion of participants whose ibs symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4. secondary end-points were the intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, stool frequency/consistency, alterations in fecal microflora over the 4 weeks. fecal microflora were analyzed in 34 patients (probiotics: 17, placebo: 17) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. results: the proportion of patients whose ibs symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4 was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group: 68.0% (17/25) versus 37.5% (9/24) (p < 0.05). secondary end-points such as improvement  in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating occurred in the probiotics group but not in the placebo group. fecal analysis revealed that b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus had increased significantly in the probiotics group after 4 weeks and that b. lactis had increased in the placebo group. conclusions: multispecies probiotics are effective in ibs patients and induce the alterations  in the composition of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == effect of water-soluble fraction of cherry tomatoes on the adhesion of probiotics and salmonella to intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == background: tomato is one of the most consumed vegetables in the world and contains many valuable nutritional components. here we investigate the prebiotic  effects of cherry tomatoes for improving gut health. results: water-soluble dietary fiber was prepared from fresh and processed (heat treatment at 80 degrees c for 15 min) cherry tomato samples, each with and without viscozyme l treatment. in the adhesion assays, all water-soluble dietary fiber samples improved adhesion of probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium bifidum) to intestinal epithelial cells (caco-2 cells). heat treatment in the preparation of juice from  cherry tomatoes showed no significant effect on the adhesion of probiotics to caco-2 cells. the oligofructose content of samples affected the intestinal adhesion of probiotic bacteria, with higher oligosaccharide concentrations associated with greater adhesion of probiotics and more inhibition of the adhesion of pathogens to caco-2 cells. conclusion: the present results suggest that cherry tomato can act as a prebiotic, with oligofructose potentially being one of its major prebiotic components.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == association of a probiotic to a helicobacter pylori eradication regimen does not  increase efficacy or decreases the adverse effects of the treatment: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: the treatment for the eradication of helicobacter pylori (h. pylori)  is complex; full effectiveness is rarely achieved and it has many adverse effects. in developing countries, increased resistance to antibiotics and its cost make eradication more difficult. probiotics can reduce adverse effects and improve the infection treatment efficacy.if the first-line therapy fails a second-line treatment using tetracycline, furazolidone and proton-pump inhibitors has been effective and low cost in brazil; however it implies in a lot of adverse effects. the aim of this study was to minimize the adverse effects and increase the eradication rate applying the association of a probiotic compound to second-line therapy regimen. methods: patients with peptic ulcer or functional dyspepsia infected by h. pylori were randomized to treatment with the furazolidone, tetracycline and lansoprazole regimen, twice a day for 7 days. in a double-blind study, patients received placebo or a probiotic compound (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum and  streptococcus faecium) in capsules, twice a day for 30 days. a symptom questionnaire was administered in day zero, after completion of antibiotic therapy, after the probiotic use and eight weeks after the end of the treatment.  upper digestive endoscopy, histological assessment, rapid urease test and breath  test were performed before and eight weeks after eradication treatment. results:  one hundred and seven patients were enrolled: 21 men with active probiotic and 19 with placebo plus 34 women with active probiotic and 33 with placebo comprising a total of 55 patients with active probiotic and 52 with placebo. fifty-one patients had peptic ulcer and 56 were diagnosed as functional dyspepsia. the per-protocol eradication rate with active probiotic was 89.8% and with placebo, 85.1% (p=0.49); per intention to treat, 81.8% and 79.6%, respectively (p=0.53). the rate of adverse effects at 7 days with the active probiotic was 59.3% and 71.2% with placebo (p=0.20). at 30 days, it was 44.9% and 60.4%, respectively (p=0.08). conclusions: the use of this probiotic compound compared to placebo in  the proposed regimen in brazilian patients with peptic ulcer or functional dyspepsia showed no significant difference in efficacy or adverse effects. trial  registration: current controlled trials isrctn04714018.

AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea in turkey: single blinded randomized study.
AB  == probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and this effect depends on the strains and dose. the aim of this study was to assess the effect of a synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and the length of hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea. this is a prospective randomized, multicenter single blinded clinical trial in hospitalized children with acute watery diarrhea. all children were treated with conventional  hydration therapy with or without a daily dose of a synbiotic (2.5 x 10(9) cfu live bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, enterococcus faecium, and 625 mg fructooligosaccharide) for 5 days. the primary endpoint was duration of diarrhea  and duration of hospitalization was the secondary endpoint. among 209 eligible children, 113 received the synbiotic mixture and 96 served as a control. the duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter ( approximately 36 h) in children  receiving the synbiotic group than the controls (77.9 +/- 30.5 vs. 114.6 +/- 37.4 h, p < 0.0001). the duration of hospitalization was shorter in children receiving the synbiotic group (4.94 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.77 +/- 1.97 days, p = 0.002). the effect  of synbiotic mixture on diarrhea started after 24th hours and stool frequency significantly decreased after 24th and 48th hours. the percentage of diarrhea-free children is significantly higher in synbiotic group at 48th and 72nd hours of synbiotic group. in conclusion, this study showed a reduction in diarrhea duration by approximately 36 h and a reduction in the duration of hospitalization with approximately 1 day in children with acute diarrhea with this synbiotic mixture.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == mucosal immunology and probiotics.
AB  == the cross-talk between the mucosa-associated immune system and microbiota is critical in mucosal tissue homeostasis as well as in protection against infectious and inflammatory diseases occurring at mucosal sites. this recent evidence has paved the way to therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the mucosa-associated immune system using probiotics. different strains of probiotics possess the ability to finely regulate dendritic cell (dc) activation, polarizing the subsequent t cell activity toward th1 (e.g. lactobacillus (lb) acidophilus),  th2 (lb.reuteri and bifidobacterium bifidum) or, as more recently demonstrated, th17 responses induced by specific strains such as lb.rhamnosus gg and lac23a, the latter isolated in our laboratory. here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of probiotics effects on mucosal immunology, particularly on cells of the innate immunity such as dcs. we also highlight our own experiences in modulating dc functions by commensal bacteria and discuss the relevance of probiotics administration in the treatment of human immunopathologies.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == influence of mother's intestinal microbiota on gut colonization in the infant.
AB  == the aim here was to elucidate the mother-infant association in the gut colonization of 1-6 month-old infants and to establish whether probiotics can influence this process. fecal samples from 80 mother-infant pairs were analyzed at 1 month (mothers and infants) and 6 months (infants) by real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess bacterial numbers. this double-blind placebo-controlled  trial involved 2 different probiotic combinations (1. lactobacillus rhamnosus + bifidobacterium longum and 2. lactobacillus paracasei + bifidobacterium longum) given to the mothers 2 months prior to and 2 months after delivery. bifidobacterium bifidum colonization in the mothers significantly increased the infants' probability of being colonized by b. bifidum and their bifidobacterial diversity indexes (di) and the mother-infant similarity indexes (si) both at 1 and 6 months of age. the counts of bifidobacterium genus (at 1 month) and bifidobacterium longum (at 6 months) correlated between mothers and infants. at 6 months, a significant effect of the probiotic intervention was found in the mother-infant association of fecal bifidobacterial counts but not in the colonization frequencies, di or si. in conclusion, a clear association between mother and infant was found in gut colonization by bifidobacteria. maternal colonization by b. bifidum had the most consistent effects on the infant's bifidobacterial microbiota. maternal probiotic treatment had little effect on this mother-infant association.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == pulse probiotic administration induces repeated small intestinal muc3 expression  in rats.
AB  == upon ingestion, probiotics may act to protect the host through a number of protective mechanisms including modulation of genes involved in intestinal innate mucosal defense such as epithelial cell-derived mucin glycoproteins and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. to determine the specificity of effect and sustainability  of response in vivo, lactobacillus plantarum 299v (lp299v), lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011 (lrr0011), and bifidobacterium bifidum r0071 (bbr0071) were added repeatedly or intermittently to the drinking water of sprague-dawley rats. after  killing the rats via co2 suffocation, muc2, muc3, neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (naip), human inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1/cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (hiap1/ciap2), and human inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2/cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (hiap2/ciap1) mrna and protein levels were analyzed via  rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry. live lp299v, bbr0071, and lrr0011 increased muc3 protein and mrna expression in jejunum and ileum. heat-killed and a nonadherent derivative of lp299v failed to induce muc3 expression. lp299v did induce expression of hiap2/ciap1 and naip expression. muc3 mucin expression was elevated for 5 d after oral administration of lp299v; however, this effect was not sustained despite ongoing daily ingestion of a probiotic. intermittent pulse ingestion of probiotics, however, was found to repeatedly increase muc3 expression. we conclude that selected probiotics can induce protective genes of mucosal intestinal epithelial cells, an effect that is reproducible with pulse probiotic administration.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria enhance autophagic ability of mononuclear phagocytes by increasing th1 autophagy-promoting cytokine (ifn-gamma) and nitric oxide (no) levels and reducing th2 autophagy-restraining cytokines (il-4 and il-13) in response to mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen.
AB  == background and objectives: control of the intracellular mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb), mainly requires an appropriate ratio of th1/th2 cytokines to  induce autophagy, a physiologically, and immunologically regulated process that has recently been highlighted as an innate defense mechanism against intracellular pathogens. current vaccines/adjuvants induce both protective th1 autophagy-promoting cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, and immunosuppressive th2 autophagy-restraining cytokines, such as il-4 and il-13. tb infection itself is also characterized by relatively high levels of th2 cytokines, which down-regulate th1 responses and subsequently subvert adequate protective immunity, and a low ratio of ifn-gamma/il-4. therefore, there is a need for a safe and non-toxic vaccine/adjuvant that will induce th1 autophagy-promoting cytokine (ifn-gamma) secretion and suppress the pre-existing subversive th2 autophagy-restraining cytokines (il-4 and il-13). as lactic acid bacteria (lab) belonging to the natural intestinal microflora and their components have been shown to shift immune responses against other antigens from th2-type cytokines toward th1-type cytokines like ifn-gamma, we investigated whether lab can improve the polarization of th1/th2 cytokines and autophagic ability of mononuclear phagocytes in response to mtb antigen. methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), which are a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system and source of crucial macrophage activators in the in vivo situation, and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hmdms) were treated with mtb antigen in the presence or absence of two strains of lab, l. rhammosus gg (lgg) and bifidobacterium bifidum mf 20/5 (b.b). pbmcs cell culture supernatants were analyzed for the production of the autophagy-promoting factors ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide (no) and the autophagy-restraining cytokines il-4 and il-13, using elisa and griess assays to detect the production of cytokines and no, respectively. in hmdms, expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (lc3-i), membrane-associated (lc3-ii) forms of lc3 protein and beclin-1,  as hallmarks of autophagy, were assessed using western blot to detect the autophagy markers. the secreted interleukin 6 (il-6), interleukin 10 (il-10), interleukin (il)-12 and transformig growth factor-beta (tgf-beta), and chemokine  (c-c motif) ligand 18 (ccl18) from hmdms were determined by elisa. also, reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis was used to assess the  mrna expressions of ccl18 in hmdms. results: treatment of pbmcs with either mtb antigen or with lab significantly increased the ifn-gamma and no production. combination of mtb antigen and lab led to synergistic increase in ifn-gamma, and  an additive increase in no. treatment with mtb antigen alone significantly increased the il-4 and il-13 production. lab significantly decreased il-4 and il-13 secretion in both unstimulated and mtb antigen-stimulated pbmcs. the ifn-gamma/il-4+il-13 ratio was enhanced, indicating th1/th2 polarization. treatment of macrophages with combined use of mtb antigen and lab led to an additive increase in beclin-1, lc3-ii expression, as well as in synergistic increase in il-12 production. treatment of macrophages with combined use of mtb antigen and lab led to a decrease in il-6, il-10, and ccl18 secretion. lab inhibited the secretion of tgf-beta by mtb-stimulated macrophages, however not significantly. treatment of macrophages with combined use of mtb antigen and lab  led to a decrease in ccl18 mrna expression. conclusion: our study implies that lab may reinforce the response of the mononuclear phagocytes to mtb antigen by inducing production of the autophagy-promoting factors ifn-gamma and no, while decreasing the th2 autophagy-restraining cytokines il-4 and il-13. hence, combination of mtb antigen and lab may perhaps be safer in more efficacious tb vaccine formulation.

TI  == comparison of in vitro models to study bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the adhesion ability of intestinal bacteria to different in vitro models of intestinal epithelia, and to estimate the suitability of these models and the type of interactions involved. methods and results: the adhesion of probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12), commensal (b. animalis iata-a2 and b. bifidum iata-es2) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (e. coli and l. monocytogenes) was determined. the adhesion models used were polycarbonate-well plates, with or without mucin, and different configurations of caco-2 and/or ht29-mtx cell cultures. all bacteria adhered to wells without mucin (2.6-27.3%), the values being highly variable depending on the bacterial strain. adhesion percentages of potentially probiotic bacteria to caco-2 cultures were remarkably lower (p < 0.05) than those to mucin, and more similar to those of pathogenic strains. the lowest adhesion of different bacterial strains was detected on ht29-mtx (0.5-2.3%) cultures and caco-2/ht29-mtx (0.6-3.2%) cocultures, while these values were increased in caco-2 cultures plus mucin. conclusions: the results suggested that bacterial strains exhibit different capacities to adhere to cellular components and several types of mucin present in different models, showing preferences for intestinal muc2. significance and impact of the study: the use of caco-2 cells monolayer plus mucin (type ii) better approaches the physiological characteristics of in vivo situation, providing a reliable and suitable in vitro model to evaluate bacterial adhesion.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == the role of a probiotics mixture in the treatment of childhood constipation: a pilot study.
AB  == background: inconsistent data exist about the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of constipation. several studies in adults with constipation showed positive effects of probiotics on constipation. inconsistent data exist regarding the effect of a single probiotic strain in constipated children. the aim of this  pilot study was to determine the effect of a mixture of probiotics containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the treatment of childhood constipation. methods: children aged 4-16 years with constipation as defined by the rome iii criteria were eligible for the study. during a 4 week period, children received a daily mix of 4 x 109 colony forming units of a probiotic mixture (ecologic(r)relief) containing bifidobacteria (b.) bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, lactobacilli (l.) casei, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus. primary outcome measures were frequency of bowel movements (bms) per week and stool consistency.  secondary outcome measures were number of faecal incontinence episodes per week,  abdominal pain and side effects. results: twenty children, 50% male, median age 8 (range 4-16) were included. the frequency of bms per week increased from 2.0 (1.0-5.0) to 4.2 (0.0-16.0) in week 2 (p = 0.10) and 3.8 (2.1-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.13). in 12 children presenting with <3 bms/week, bms per week increased significantly from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) to 3.0 (0.0-7.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 3.0 (0.0-10.0) in week 4 (p = 0.01). the stool consistency was reported as hard in 7  children at baseline, in 4 children at week 2 (p = 0.23) and in 6 children after  4 weeks of treatment (p = 1.00). a significant decrease in number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was found in the entire group: 4.0 (0.0-35.0) to 1.5 (0.0-14.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 0.3 (0.0-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.001). the  presence of abdominal pain decreased significantly from 45% to 25% in week 2 (p = 0.04) and 20% at week 4 (p = 0.006). no side effects were reported. conclusion: this pilot study shows that a mixture of probiotics, has positive effects on symptoms of constipation. to confirm these findings, a large randomised placebo controlled trial is required.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in mrs broth and buffalo milk.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: eight dairy bacteria tolerant to la were grown in mrs  broth containing la (200 microg ml(-1)) and cla was assessed. seven bacteria were able to form cla after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between  17% and 36%. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest la conversion and were  inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of la. the production of cla at 200 microg ml(-1) of la was two- or threefold in milk than mrs broth. all evaluated strains were able to produce cla from high la levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). conclusions: the most tolerant strain to la was lact. casei. lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of cla at high la concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). the selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. low concentration of la must be added to the medium to enhance cla formation. significance and impact of the study: the production of cla by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.

TI  == study of adhesion and survival of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria on table olives with the aim of formulating a new probiotic food.
AB  == with the aim of developing new functional foods, a traditional product, the table olive, was used as a vehicle for incorporating probiotic bacterial species. survival on table olives of lactobacillus rhamnosus (three strains), lactobacillus paracasei (two strains), bifidobacterium bifidum (one strain), and  bifidobacterium longum (one strain) at room temperature was investigated. the results obtained using a selected olive sample demonstrated that bifidobacteria and one strain of l. rhamnosus (lactobacillus gg) showed a good survival rate, with a recovery of about 10(6) cfu g(-1) after 30 days. the lactobacillus gg population remained unvaried until the end of the experiment, while a slight decline (to about 10(5) cfu g(-1)) was observed for bifidobacteria. high viability, with more than 10(7) cfu g(-1), was observed throughout the 3-month experiment for l. paracasei impc2.1. this strain, selected for its potential probiotic characteristics and for its lengthy survival on olives, was used to validate table olives as a carrier for transporting bacterial cells into the human gastrointestinal tract. l. paracasei impc2.1 was recovered from fecal samples in four out of five volunteers fed 10 to 15 olives per day carrying about 10(9) to 10(10) viable cells for 10 days.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in sos-chromotest.
AB  == antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest. the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the  tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz). high genotoxicity inhibition  (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes. antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  == the respiratory quinones of 73 strains of gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (mk-7) were the main quinone type found  in representatives of the genus bacillus and in sporolactobacillus inulinus. however, a strain of b. thuringiensis produced mk-8 in addition to mk-7, and strains of b. lentus and b. pantothenticus appeared to produce mk-9 and mk-8, respectively, with no mk-7. in the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in pediococcus cerevisiae nctc 8066 and lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus atcc 7469, which contained menaquinones, and streptococcus faecalis nctc 775 and him 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes  (except actinomyces odontolyticus and bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in protaminobacter alboflavus atcc 8458, the so-called  actinobacillus actinoides atcc 15900 and noguchia granulosis nctc 10559.
