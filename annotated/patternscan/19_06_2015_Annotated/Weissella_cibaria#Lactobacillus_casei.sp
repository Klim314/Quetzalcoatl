TI  == newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  == five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rrna sequencing. essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low ph, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. antimicrobial activities  against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. further studies revealed weissella and enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in  the human diet. the folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using lactobacillus casei ncim 2364 as indicator strain. the three strains of l. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against  various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == structural and rheological characterisation of heteropolysaccharides produced by  lactic acid bacteria in wheat and sorghum sourdough.
AB  == hydrocolloids improve the volume, texture, and shelf life of bread. exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) during sourdough  fermentation can replace hydrocolloids. it was the aim of this study to determine whether heteropolysaccharides (heps) synthesized intracellularly from sugar nucleotides by glycosyltransferases are produced in wheat and gluten-free sorghum sourdough at effective levels. the heps-producing strains lactobacillus casei fua3185, l. casei fua3186, and lactobacillus buchneri fua3154 were used; weissella cibaria 10m producing no eps in the absence of sucrose served as control strain. cell suspensions of l. buchneri in mrs showed the highest viscosity at low shear rate. glycosyltransferase genes responsible of heps formation in lab were expressed in sorghum and wheat sourdough. however, only heps produced by l. buchneri influenced the rheological properties of sorghum sourdoughs but not of wheat sourdoughs. sorghum sourdough fermented with l. buchneri exhibited a low |g*| compared to the control, indicating a decrease in resistance to deformation. an increase in tan delta indicated decreased elasticity. the use of lab producing heps expands the diversity of eps and increases the variety of cultures for use in baking.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
