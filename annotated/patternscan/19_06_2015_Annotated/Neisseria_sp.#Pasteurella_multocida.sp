TI  == aldolase-catalyzed synthesis of beta-d-galp-(1-->9)-d-kdn: a novel acceptor for sialyltransferases.
AB  == [reaction: see text] beta-d-galp-(1-->9)-d-kdn, a disaccharide component of the cell wall of streptomyces sp. mb-8, was synthesized from beta-d-galp-(1-->6)-d-manp and pyruvate using a sialic acid aldolase. the obtained kdn-containing compound was a novel acceptor for bacterial sialyltransferases. unusual alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialyltrisaccharides and a tetrasaccharide were synthesized using a one-pot two-enzyme system containing a neisseria meningitidis cmp-sialic acid synthetase and a pasteurella  multocida sialyltransferase or a photobacterium damsela alpha2,6-sialyltransferase.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility of pasteurella and related bacteria to five orally administered antibiotics].
AB  == tetracyclines and beta-lactam antibiotics are usually recommended for the treatment of pasteurellosis following bite wounds. however other oral antimicrobial agents could be proposed. in vitro susceptibility of 94 pasteurella strains [p. multocida (79), p. stomatis (11), p. dagmatis (2), p. canis (1), p. "sp" (1)], 20 group ef-4 strains and 28 neisseria weaveri strains (formerly group m-5), that are bacteria often isolated after animal-inflicted wounds, was studied towards five antibiotics: clarithromycin, azithromycin, pristinamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. mics were determined by the agar dilution method using htm medium (oxoid), and for pristinamycin using both htm and mueller-hinton agar supplemented with 5% horse blood (bmh). most of pasteurella isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to clarithromycin (63%) and to azithromycin (90.5%) with lower mics for azithromycin. fourty-two and thirty-two percent of pasteurella strains were susceptible to pristinamycin respectively on htm and on bmh. ef-4 and n. weaveri were more sensitive than pasteurella to macrolides and to pristinamycin. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was active against all isolates, with higher mics for ef-4 and n. weaveri. on all strains tested, the lowest mics were observed for ciprofloxacin. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin could be proposed as a therapeutic alternative in case of pasteurellosis following animal bites.

TI  == aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. the most frequently isolated microorganisms included: iij, ef-4, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci, corynebacterium sp., enterobacteria, neisseria sp., moraxella sp., and bacillus sp. other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. the high incidence of iij, ef-4, p. multocida, and s. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
