treponema denticola outer membrane enhances the phagocytosis of collagen-coated beads by gingival fibroblasts.
human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) degrade collagen fibrils in physiological processes by phagocytosis. since treponema denticola outer membrane (om) extract perturbs actin filaments, important structures in phagocytosis, we determined whether the om affects collagen phagocytosis in vitro by hgfs. phagocytosis was measured by flow cytometric assessment of internalized collagen-coated fluorescent latex beads. confluent hgfs pretreated with t. denticola atcc 35405 om exhibited an increase in the percentage of collagen phagocytic cells (phagocytosis index [pi]) and in the number of beads per phagocytosing cell (phagocytic capacity [pc]) compared with untreated controls. the enhancement was swift (within 15 min) and was still evident after 1 day. pi and pc of hgfs for bovine serum albumin (bsa)-coated beads were also increased, indicating a global increase in phagocytic processes. these results contrasted those for control om from veillonella atypica atcc 17744, which decreased phagocytosis. the t. denticola om-induced increase in bead uptake was eliminated by heating the om and by depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin d treatment of hgfs. fluid-phase accumulation of lucifer yellow was enhanced in a saturable, concentration-dependent, transient manner by the t. denticola om. our findings were not due to hgf detachment or cytotoxicity in response to the t. denticola om treatment since the hgfs exhibited minimal detachment from the substratum; they did not take up propidium iodide; and there was no change in their size, granularity, or content of sub-g1 dna. we conclude that a heat-sensitive component(s) in t. denticola om extract stimulates collagen phagocytosis and other endocytic processes such as nonspecific phagocytosis and pinocytosis by hgfs.
