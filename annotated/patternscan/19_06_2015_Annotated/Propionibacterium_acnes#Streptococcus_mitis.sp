TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == infectious prosthetic hip joint loosening: bacterial species involved in its aetiology and their antibiotic resistance profiles against antibiotics recommended for the therapy of implant-associated infections.
AB  == reliable microbiological diagnosis along with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy are key elements in the management of prosthetic-joint infections (pjis). the purpose of this study was to characterize antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria involved in the aetiology of pjis. a total of 33 bacterial isolates cultured from 31 patients undergoing exchange of total hip prostheses were analyzed. the diagnostic approach toward isolation of prosthesis- associated microorganisms included sonication of retrieved implants and conventional cultures of periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. the in vitro resistance profiles of bacterial isolates were determined in relation to antibiotics recommended for the therapy of pjis using the disc diffusion method, e-tests((r)) and broth microdilution system. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were predominant microorganisms followed by staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty out of 30 and 12 out of 30 staphylococcal isolates were methicillin- and multi-drug resistant,  respectively. only two isolates were rifampicinresistant. all staphylococci were  susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid. this paper stresses the pathogenic role of staphylococci in patients suffering from implant loosening and reports high methicillin- and multidrug-resistance rates in these bacteria. hence, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of individual bacterial isolates must always be performed to guide selection of the optimal therapeutic option.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == efficacy of ozone on microorganisms in the tooth root canal.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effect of ozone gas on the remaining bacteria after chemomechanical instrumentation of tooth root canal. the study was carried out at the department of endodontics and restorative dentistry, school of dental medicine, university of zagreb. a total of 37 tooth root canals from 23 teeth (10 incisors, 2 canines, 8 premolars and 3 molars) with a diagnosis of chronic apical periodontitis (17 untreated teeth and 6 retreatments) from 20 adult patients (11 females and 9 male) were selected. endodontic samples consisted of 74 swabs from 37 canals. the first root canal swab was taken following a completed chemomechanical instrumentation by a sterile paper point after rinsing the root canal with a sterile saline solution. the canal was dried  and treated with ozone gas for 40 seconds (healozone, kavo, germany). after the ozone treatment the canal was rinsed with a sterile saline solution a second swab was taken. the swabs were stored in transport media until cultivation. microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, commercial biochemical test microbiological analysis and bacteria count. a significant decrease in the number of bacteria (p < 0.001) was  found after the ozone treatment: the total number of bacteria was 82%, 67% of aerobic and 93% of anaerobic bacteria. when analysing individually, a significant decrease was found for streptococcus mitis and propionibacterium acnes (p < 0.05). the results of this study shows the efficacy of ozone on the bacterial count reduction in the root canal treatment.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates by a sensitive flow cytometric assay (bactiflow): a multicentre validation study.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs) still represents an ongoing risk. as a result of septic complications, particularly observed with older pcs, the shelf life of pcs has been reduced in germany to 4 days. in this study, bacterial screening of pcs by bactiflow (bf) flow cytometry  was introduced in three german blood services to evaluate the robustness and applicability of the assay. results were used to discuss the potential for the extension of pc shelf life to 5 days. study design and methods: a total of 1956 pcs were tested on days 4 or 5+ after pc production using the bf, whereas the bact/alert culture system served as reference method. results: two pcs were confirmed positive by culture only and were identified as propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus species. two pcs were confirmed positive for streptococcus mitis by bf and culture. additionally, two pcs were culture-positive only in one  culture bottle (aerobic: s. mitis and anaerobic: s. hominis). retrospective analysis of bacterial growth kinetics provide the indication that corresponding bacterial titres were most likely below the bf analytical detection limit (<150 cfu ml(-1) ) and had probably no transfusion relevance. all remaining specimens were tested negative. conclusions: testing of pcs by bf was successfully implemented. the bf proved sufficient as a rapid screening method to improve pc safety. this study further provides data supporting the extension of pc shelf life to 5 days after negative bf testing on day 4.

TI  == comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora in postoperative maxillary cyst fluid by 16s rrna gene and culture methods.
AB  == intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc), and dna was extracted from the pomc fluid. bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16s rrna gene. identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. the phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16s rrna gene clones. a total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. a total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in pomc fluid samples by 16s rrna gene analysis. species of prevotella (91%), neisseria (73%), fusobacterium (73%), porphyromonas (73%), and propionibacterium (73%) were found  to be highly prevalent in all patients. streptococcus mitis (64%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (55%), propionibacterium acnes (55%), staphylococcus capitis (55%), and streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. the results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by  16s rrna gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect  by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with  pomc.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == metagenomic detection of phage-encoded platelet-binding factors in the human oral cavity.
AB  == the human oropharynx is a reservoir for many potential pathogens, including streptococcal species that cause endocarditis. although oropharyngeal microbes have been well described, viral communities are essentially uncharacterized. we conducted a metagenomic study to determine the composition of oropharyngeal dna viral communities (both phage and eukaryotic viruses) in healthy individuals and  to evaluate oropharyngeal swabs as a rapid method for viral detection. viral dna  was extracted from 19 pooled oropharyngeal swabs and sequenced. viral communities consisted almost exclusively of phage, and complete genomes of several phage were recovered, including escherichia coli phage t3, propionibacterium acnes phage pa6, and streptococcus mitis phage sm1. phage relative abundances changed dramatically depending on whether samples were chloroform treated or filtered to  remove microbial contamination. pbla and pblb genes of phage sm1 were detected in the metagenomes. pbla and pblb mediate the attachment of s. mitis to platelets and play a significant role in s. mitis virulence in the endocardium, but have never previously been detected in the oral cavity. these genes were also identified in salivary metagenomes from three individuals at three time points and in individual saliva samples by pcr. additionally, we demonstrate that phage  sm1 can be induced by commonly ingested substances. our results indicate that the oral cavity is a reservoir for pbla and pblb genes and for phage sm1 itself. further studies will determine the association between pbla and pblb genes in the oral cavity and the risk of endocarditis.

TI  == bacterial colonization and infection of electrophysiological cardiac devices detected with sonication and swab culture.
AB  == background: electrophysiological cardiac devices are increasingly used. the frequency of subclinical infection is unknown. we investigated all explanted devices using sonication, a method for detection of microbial biofilms on foreign bodies. methods and results: consecutive patients in whom cardiac pacemakers and  implantable cardioverter/defibrillators were removed at our institution between october 2007 and december 2008 were prospectively included. devices (generator and/or leads) were aseptically removed and sonicated, and the resulting sonication fluid was cultured. in parallel, conventional swabs of the generator pouch were performed. a total of 121 removed devices (68 pacemakers, 53 implantable cardioverter/defibrillators) were included. the reasons for removal were insufficient battery charge (n=102), device upgrading (n=9), device dysfunction (n=4), or infection (n=6). in 115 episodes (95%) without clinical evidence of infection, 44 (38%) grew bacteria in sonication fluid, including propionibacterium acnes (n=27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=11), gram-positive anaerobe cocci (n=3), gram-positive anaerobe rods (n=1), gram-negative rods (n=1), and mixed bacteria (n=1). in 21 of 44 sonication-positive episodes, bacterial counts were significant (>or=10 colony-forming units/ml of sonication fluid). in 26 sterilized controls, sonication cultures remained negative in 25 cases (96%). in 112 cases without clinical infection, conventional swab cultures were performed: 30 cultures (27%)  were positive, and 18 (60%) were concordant with sonication fluid cultures. six devices and leads were removed because of infection, growing staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mitis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6 sonication fluid cultures and 4 conventional swab cultures. conclusions: bacteria can colonize cardiac electrophysiological devices without clinical signs of infection.

TI  == assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  == in contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. the objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. one representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus lugdunensis. among the 48 s. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. in parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla, vana, vanb, vand, vane and vang genes. all of them were sensitive to vancomycin. there were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB  == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the  aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation  and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with  a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

TI  == cytokine induction by extracellular products of oral viridans group streptococci.
AB  == during an etiological study of kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome [mcls]), we found that dominant viridans streptococcal strains on tooth  surfaces and in the throat of both mcls patients and non-mcls control children formed erythrogenic and biologically active, extracellular products. in this study, we demonstrated that erythrogenic culture supernatant concentrates of representative strains (two streptococcus mitis and two streptococcus oralis), when injected intravenously, induced serum tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 (il-6), and gamma interferon in muramyldipeptide- or propionibacterium acnes-primed c3h/hen mice. the concentrates also induced tumor  necrosis factor alpha, il-6, and thymocyte-activating factor (essentially il-1) in murine peritoneal macrophage, human monocyte, and human whole-blood cultures.  an erythrogenic, heat-labile extracellular protein fraction (f-1) that was concentrated from the culture supernatants of a representative s. mitis strain exhibited the above-mentioned cytokine-inducing activity. this partially purified f-1 fraction also induced thymocyte-activating factor and il-6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and gingival fibroblast cultures.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
