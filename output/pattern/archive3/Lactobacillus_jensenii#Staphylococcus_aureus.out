antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
background: biosurfactants (bs) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. bs exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. in this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of bs produced by lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical multidrug resistant (mdr) strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). cell-bound bs from both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. the surface activities of crude bs samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. the antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both bs against the above mentioned mdr pathogens were determined. results: surface activities for both bs ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. bs of both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against a. baumannii, e. coli and s. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the bs caused membrane damage for a. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in s. aureus. conclusion: our results indicate that bs isolated from two lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against mdr strains of a. baumannii, e. coli and mrsa. both bs also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against a. baumannii, e. coli and s. aureus. together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for bs as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
[lactobacillus inhibit adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells].
to assess the ability of the previously selected human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus) t79-3, t90-1 and lactobacillus jensenii (l. jensenii) t118-3, t231-1 to inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus and block their adhesion to hela cells. the inhibitory bioactive substances produced by these lactobacillus were also identified. inhibitory substances interaction tests were carried out by using a streak-diffusion method on agar plates. three types of interaction were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of lactobacillus on adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells: exclusion group (lactobacillus and hela followed by pathogens), competition group (lactobacillus, hela and pathogens together) and displacement group (pathogens and hela followed by the addition of lactobacillus). the number of hela cells adhered to staphylococcus aureus was quantified by bacteria colony counts on lb plate. the results showed that lactic acids produced by the lactobacillus are the main substances that can inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and there is variation among the three types of interaction regarding the inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus. the effects of lactobacillus on blocking the adhesion to hela cells were concentration dependent. all four lactobacillus isolates displayed the ability to inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and block staphylococcus aureus adherence to hela cells. exclusion group was the most effective, and t79-3 showed greater capacity to block staphylococcus aureus adherence compared with the other three isolates. the present study suggests the potential ability of l. crispatus t79-3 as probiotic for the treatment and prevention of urogenital infections in women.
lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats, especially the composition of lactobacillus species.
