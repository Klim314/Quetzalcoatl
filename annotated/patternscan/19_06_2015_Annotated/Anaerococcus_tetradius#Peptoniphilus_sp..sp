TI  == bloodstream infections due to peptoniphilus spp.: report of 15 cases.
AB  == peptoniphilus spp. are gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) that were formerly classified in the genus peptostreptococcus. this study describes 15 cases of peptoniphilus spp. bloodstream infection (bsi) diagnosed from 2007 to 2011 using  16s rdna sequencing in patients with pneumonia, pre-term delivery, soft tissue infection or colon or bladder disease. seven out of 15 (47%) of these cases had polymicrobial bsis. one of the isolates was closely related to p. duerdenii (eu526290), while the other 14 isolates were most closely related to a peptoniphilus sp. reference strain (atcc 29743) and p. hareii (y07839). peptoniphilus is a rare but important cause of bsi.

TI  == proposal of the genera anaerococcus gen. nov., peptoniphilus gen. nov. and gallicola gen. nov. for members of the genus peptostreptococcus.
AB  == members of genus peptostreptococcus have previously been found to be distantly related to the type species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, on the basis of 16s rdna sequence similarities. they were divided into three major phylogenetic groups, and their peptidoglycan structure and biochemical traits differed between groups. the reclassification of the species of these three groups into three new  genera, peptoniphilus gen. nov., anaerococcus gen. nov. and gallicola gen. nov.,  is proposed. the genus peptoniphilus gen. nov. includes the following butyrate-producing, non-saccharolytic species that use peptone and amino acids as major energy sources: peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus comb. nov. (type species), peptoniphilus lacrimaris comb. nov., peptoniphilus harei comb. nov., peptoniphilus indolicus comb. nov. and peptoniphilus ivorii comb. nov. the genus  anaerococcus gen. nov. contains the saccharolytic, butyrate-producing species anaerococcus prevotii comb. nov. (type species), anaerococcus tetradius comb. nov., anaerococcus lactolyticus comb. nov., anaerococcus hydrogenalis comb. nov., anaerococcus vaginalis comb. nov. and anaerococcus octavius sp. nov. the genus gallicola gen. nov. contains a single species, gallicola barnesae comb. nov.
