TI  == genotyping by randomly amplified polymorphic dna of bacteriocin producing lactobacillus acidophilus strains from nigeria.
AB  == yogurt and starter culture producers are still searching strains of lactobacillus acidophilus to produce healthier yogurt with a longer shelf life and better texture, taste, and quality. this study determined the genotyping of bacteriocin  producing lactobacillus acidophilus strains recovered from nigerian yogurts. yogurt samples were collected from four different states of south west regions of nigeria. isolates were obtained from mrs medium and biochemically characterized.  this was further confirmed by api50ch. the bacteriocin positivity and activity was determined. genomic characterization of our lactobacillus acidophilus strains was done with randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr. all yogurt samples containing lactobacillus acidophilus strains meet the probiotic requirement of >/=10(6) cfu/ml. the gel picture revealed 6 rapd clonal types of lactobacillus acidophilus strains with rapd type c observed to be more common. significant differences existed in the mean growth inhibition zone (t = -7.32, p < 0.05 for e. coli atcc; t = -6.19, p < 0.05 for e. coli clinical isolates; t = -6.16, p < 0.05 for enterobacter sp; t = -11.92, p < 0.05 for salmonella typhi, t = -1.10, p > 0.05 staphylococcus aureus). no correlation between the bacteriocin production, activity, and their rapd clonal division (x(2) = 7.49, p = 0.1610, df = 5). in conclusion, l. acidophilus isolated in nigeria samples met the probiotic requirements of >/=10(6) cfu/ml and produce bacteriocins with good spectrum of activity.

TI  == microbiological quality of sous and tamarind, traditional drinks consumed in jordan.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of sous (a drink prepared by extracting dried roots of glycyrrhiza glabra) and tamarind (a drink prepared by infusing tamarindus indica dried pulp), traditional drinks consumed in jordan. twenty-one samples of sous and 44 samples of tamarind were collected from the local market in amman, jordan. water is the major component of the drinks. sous drink is characterized by having an alkaline ph (range, 6.6 to 9.9;  mean, 8.6), whereas tamarind drink has an acidic ph (range, 1.8 to 3.7; mean, 2.8). the drinks are not processed for safety before serving, and at some vendors drinks are not properly refrigerated. the mean counts for aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts in sous drink samples were 5.9, 5.0, and 3.8 log cfu/ml, respectively; those in tamarind drink samples were 4.0, <1, and 5.8 log cfu/ml, respectively. the lactic acid bacteria isolated were enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus buchneri. the yeast isolates in sous drink were from the genera candida, filobasidium, hanseniaspora, lodderomyces, pichia, and williopsis, and those in tamarind drink were from arthroascus, brettanomyces, candida, debaromyces, filobasidiella, hanseniaspora, klavispora, lodderomyces, pichia, saccharomycodes, trichosporon, and zygosaccharomyces. enterobacteriaceae were detected in two sous samples and were identified as enterobacter sakazakii and erwinia sp., and in two tamarind samples and were identified as citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae. salmonella was detected in one sous and one tamarind sample. pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in only one sous sample. these findings highlight the importance of application of hygienic practices throughout preparation and vending of drinks, starting with raw ingredients and continuing through preparation, storage, display, and serving.
