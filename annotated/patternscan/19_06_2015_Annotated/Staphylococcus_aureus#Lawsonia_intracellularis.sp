TI  == immunomodulatory factors and infectious agents associated with the hepatic gene expression of the igf system in nursery pigs.
AB  == recent findings suggest there is a complex interaction between the igf system and the inflammatory immune response. the objective of this study was to determine whether gene expression of growth factors (igf-1, igf-binding protein-3 (igfbp-3) and growth hormone receptors (ghr)) in the liver is associated with gene expression of immunomodulators in the liver, including c-reactive protein (crp),  serum amyloid a (saa), haptoglobin (hp), interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha), ifn-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-10 and il-18, as well as with the presence of salmonella spp., lawsonia intracellularis, brachyspira spp., enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, swine influenza virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) in nursery pigs (n=74) from commercial farms (n=4). gene expression was quantified using reverse transcription quantitative-pcr (rt-qpcr) and the data were modelled using logistic regression methods. pigs with elevated igf-1 expression were less likely to have increased expression of tnf-alpha (odds ratio (or)=0.14, p<0.01) and il-18 (or=0.19, p<0.05), and less likely to be colonized with prrsv (or=0.03, p<0.01). pigs with  increased expression of igfbp-3 were more likely to have elevated il-6 expression (or=8.5, p<0.05). it was also observed that igfbp-3 and igf-1 were significantly  associated when hp expression was low (or=30, p<0.05), but this association was not significant when hp expression was high (p=0.54). pigs with increased expression of ghr were less likely to have elevated expression of saa (or=0.01, p<0.05) and il-1beta (or=0.03, p<0.05), but more likely to have increased expression of crp (or=290, p<0.01). overall, there appears to be an inverse association between the hepatic expression of the igf system (igf-1, igfbp-3, ghr) and certain cytokines (il-1beta, il-18, tnf-alpha) and acute-phase proteins  (saa, hp).

TI  == phytochemical, toxicological and antimicrobial evaluation of lawsonia inermis extracts against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: the emerging resistance of pathogen against the currently available antimicrobial agents demands the search of new antimicrobial agents. the use of medicinal plants as natural substitute is the paramount area of research to overwhelm the drug resistance of infectious agents. scientists have not made enough effort on the evaluation of safety of medicinal plant yet. methods: in the present study antimicrobial activity of lawsonia inermis is investigated against  clinical isolates of seven bacteria including four gram negative (escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella spp., shigella sonnei) and three gram positive (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis) using disc diffusion method. four types of lawsonia inermis extracts were prepared using methanol, chloroform, acetone and water as extraction solvents, while dmso (dimethyl sulfoxide) and water as dissolution solvents. the rate and extent of bacterial killing was estimated by time-kill kinetic assay at 1x mic of each bacterial isolate. the overall safety of lawsonia inermis extracts was assessed in mice. results: lawsonia inermis displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains used in the study. the minimum value of mic for different bacterial strains ranged from 2.31 mg/ml to 9.27 mg/ml. at 1x mic of each bacterial isolate, 3log10 decrease in cfu was recorded after 6 hours of drug exposure and no growth was observed in almost all  tested bacteria after 24 hours of exposure. no sign of toxidrome were observed during in vivo toxicity evaluation in mice at 300 mg/kg concentration. conclusion: in conclusion, the present study provides the scientific rational for medicinal use of lawsonia inermis. the use of lawsonia inermis extracts is of great significance as substitute antimicrobial agent in therapeutics.

TI  == preparation of antibacterial pva and peo nanofibers containing lawsonia inermis (henna) leaf extracts.
AB  == concerns about health issues and environmental pollution stimulate research to find new health and hygiene related products with healing properties and minimum  negative effect on the environment. development of new, natural antibacterial agents has become one of the most important research areas to combat some pathogens such as gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, algae, yeast, and some microorganisms which cause serious human infections. lawsonia inermis (henna) leaf extracts for preparation of antibacterial poly(ethylene oxide) (peo) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva) nanofibers via electrospinning technique were investigated. peo and pva based electrospun fibers containing henna extract were  verified by the appearance of ftir peaks corresponding to the pure extract. our study demonstrates that 2.793 wt.% li in pva and peo based solutions showed bactericidal effects against staphylococcus aureus and bacteriostatic action to escherichia coli. concentrations of henna leaf extract strongly impacted antibacterial activities against both bacteria. henna leaves have a great potential to be used as a source of a potent eco-friendly antimicrobial agent.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of henna extracts.
AB  == lawsonia inermis (henna plant) has been used in herbal medicine for ages. however, the medical benefits of this plant have been discussed in only a few publications. in this study, the antibacterial effects of water, alcoholic and oily extracts of lawsonia inermis leaves against bacterial cultures isolated from various skin diseases were investigated and compared with tetracycline, ampicillin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin antibiotics. cultures of staphylococcus  aureus staphylococcus epidermidis (co-agulase negative staphylococci or cons), ss-hemolytic streptococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa species were obtained from 74 (35 females, 39 males) patients with different skin infections who attended the dermatology outpatient clinic in basra general hospital. the bacterial isolates were treated with l. inermis extracts in vitro. alcoholic and oily extracts were more effective than the water extract which had no effects using standard method of nccl, 2000.alcoholic extracts had the highest antibacterial activity with a mic of 0.125-0.150 microg/ml against ss-hemolytic streptococci and against cons was 0.125-175 microg/ml .oily extracts had a mic of 0.25-0.30 microg/ml against staphylococcus epidermidis (cons). both alcoholic and oily extracts had the same mic (0.5 microg/ml) on staphylococcus aureus. however, alcoholic extracts were more effective on pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mic of 0.5-0.57 microg/ml than oily extract (mic of 0.20-0.28 microg/ml). however, there were no statically differences between the effects of oily and alcoholic henna extracts (p= 0.050).when comparing the extracts' mics with those of antibiotics,  alcoholic extracts showed pronounced antibacterial effects against the isolated bacteria in vitro but oily extracts had much similar mics to those of antibiotics and there are significant difference between effect of both extracts and antibiotics p>0.050.

TI  == antibacterial activity of some medicinal plant extracts.
AB  == antibacterial activity of hot aqueous and methanolic extracts prepared from six plants (terminallia chebula, terminallia bellerica, phyllanthus emblica, punica granatum, lawsonia alba and mikania micrantha) used in traditional folk medicines of india were screened against five pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus mtcc 2940, bacillus subtilis mtcc 441, escherichia coli mtcc 739, proteus vulgaris mtcc 426 and enterobacter aerogenes mtcc 111). the highest antibacterial potentiality was exhibited by the methanolic leaf extract of t. chebula, followed by the aqueous fruit extract of t. bellerica. the leaf extract of t. chebula can  be considered to be as equally potent as the most effective antibiotics, such as  ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, kanamycin, ofloxacin and cephalexin. a sensitivity test performed with commonly used sensitivity test disks resulted in the appearance of multiple drug resistance phenotypes of the bacteria tested. a comparison of data in the inhibition zones of pathogenic bacteria showed that gentamycin, ofloxacin, kanamycin and tobramycin were effective against all of the bacterial strains tested.

TI  == antibacterial properties of traditionally used indian medicinal plants.
AB  == in search of broad-spectrum antibacterial activity from traditionally used indian medicinal plants, 66 ethanolic plant extracts were screened against nine different bacteria. of these, 39 extracts demonstrated activity against six or more test bacteria. twelve extracts showing broad-spectrum activity were tested against specific multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbetal)-producing enteric bacteria. in vitro efficacy was expressed in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of plant extracts. mic values ranged from 0.32-7.5 mg/ml against mrsa and 0.31-6.25 mg/ml against esbetal-producing enteric bacteria. the overall activity against all groups of bacteria was found in order of plumbago zeylanica > hemidesmus indicus > acorus calamus > camellia sinensis > terminalia chebula > terminalia bellerica > holarrhena antidysenterica > lawsonia inermis > mangifera indica > punica granatum > cichorium intybus and delonix regia. in addition, these extracts showed synergistic interaction with tetracycline, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin against s. aureus and/or escherichia coli. the ethanolic extracts of more than 12 plants were found nontoxic to sheep erythrocytes and nonmutagenic, determined by ames test using salmonella typhimurium test strains (ta 97a, ta 100, ta 102 and ta 104). based on above properties, six plants-plumbago zeylanica, hemidesmus indicus, acorus calamus, punica granatum, holarrhena antidysenterica and delonix regia-were further subjected to fractionation-based study. ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol fractions of more  than six plants indicated that the active phytocompounds were distributed mainly  into acetone and ethyl acetate fractions, whereas they were least prevalent in methanol fractions as evident from their antibacterial activity against mdr bacteria. gram-positive and gram-negative mdr bacteria are almost equally sensitive to these extracts/fractions, indicating their broad-spectrum nature. however, strain- and plant extract-dependent variations in the antibacterial activity were also evident. time-kill assay with the most promising plant fraction plumbago zeylanica (ethyl acetate fraction) demonstrated killing of test bacteria at the level lower than its mic. further, identification of active constituents in each fraction and their additive and synergistic interactions are needed to exploit them in evaluating efficacy and safety in vivo against mdr bacteria.

TI  == effect of certain bioactive plant extracts on clinical isolates of beta-lactamase producing methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ethanolic extracts and some fractions from 10 indian medicinal plants, known for  antibacterial activity, were investigated for their ability to inhibit clinical isolates of beta-lactamase producing methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa). synergistic interaction of plant extracts with certain antibiotics was also evaluated. the mrsa test strains were found to be multi-drug resistant and also exhibited high level of resistance to common beta-lactam antibiotics. these strains produced beta-lactamases, which  hydrolyze one or other beta-lactam antibiotics, tested. the extract of the plants from camellia sinensis (leaves), delonix regia (flowers), holarrhena antidysenterica (bark), lawsonia inermis (leaves), punica granatum (rind), terminalia chebula (fruits) and terminalia belerica (fruits) showed a broad-spectrum of antibacterial activity with an inhibition zone size of 11 mm to 27 mm, against all the test bacteria. the extracts from the leaves of ocimum sanctum showed better activity against the three mrsa strains. on the other hand, extracts from allium sativum (bulb) and citrus sinensis (rind) exhibited little or no activity, against mrsa strains. the antibacterial potency of crude extracts was determined in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by the tube dilution method. mic values, of the plant extracts, ranged from 1.3 to 8.2 mg/ml, against the test bacteria. further, the extracts from punica granatum and delonix regia were fractionated in benzene, acetone and methanol. antibacterial activity  was observed in acetone as well as in the methanol fractions. in vitro synergistic interaction of crude extracts from camellia sinensis, lawsonia inermis, punica granatum, terminalia chebula and terminalia belerica was detected with tetracycline. moreover, the extract from camellia sinensis also showed synergism with ampicillin.tlc of the above extracts revealed the presence of major phytocompounds, like alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, phenols and saponins. tlc-bioautography indicated phenols and flavonoids as major active compounds.
