TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == clinical and microbiological profiles of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive brazilians undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy and hiv-seronegative brazilians with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study compares the periodontal clinical profile and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive and hiv-seronegative subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 172 subjects were distributed into two hiv-seropositive groups (37 chronic periodontitis [h+cp+] and 35 periodontally healthy [h+cp-] individuals) and two hiv-seronegative groups (49 chronic periodontitis [h-cp+] and 51 periodontally healthy [h-cp-] subjects). subgingival samples were collected from six sites with the deepest probing depth in the periodontitis groups and six random sites in the groups with periodontal health. all hiv-infected patients had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart)  for at least 2 years. the presence and levels of 33 bacterial species were detected by dna probes and the checkerboard method. kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney tests were used to seek for significant differences among and between groups. results: h-cp+ patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction and inflammation than h+cp+ patients, whereas h+cp- subjects presented a greater percentage of sites with bleeding than h-cp- subjects (p <0.01). patients who were hiv seronegative showed higher prevalence and levels of most bacterial species than hiv seropositive patients. periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas noxia were more frequently detected in h-cp+ subjects compared to h+cp+ and controls. in contrast, enterococcus faecalis and acinetobacter baumannii were more commonly found in hiv-infected than in non-hiv-infected subjects (p <0.05). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens are more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of hiv-seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas species not usually associated with periodontitis are detected in higher frequency in hiv-seropositive subjects under haart.
