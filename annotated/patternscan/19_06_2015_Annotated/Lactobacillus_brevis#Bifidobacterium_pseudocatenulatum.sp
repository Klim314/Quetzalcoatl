TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-two strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species have been tested against 12 antibiotics and two antibiotic mixtures by a commercial system (sensititre anaero3; treck diagnostic systems). the upper limits of some minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were completed on mrs agar plates by the nccls procedure. all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and imipenem and most of the strains were resistant to metronidazole. bifidobacteria isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, whereas about half of the  lactobacilli were resistant. approximately 30% of the bifidobacterium isolates were resistant to tetracycline, as well as five lactobacillus strains belonging to four different species. none of the tested bifidobacterium isolates was resistant to vancomycin, whereas a species-dependent resistance was found among the lactobacilli. single strains of bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus brevis were resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin. most of the observed resistances seemed to be intrinsic, but some others could be compatible with transmissible determinants.
