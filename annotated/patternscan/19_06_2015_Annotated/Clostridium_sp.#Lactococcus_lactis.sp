TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == characterisation of the spoilage bacterial microbiota in oyster gills during storage at different temperatures.
AB  == background: the spoilage bacterial community in oyster gill was investigated during storage at 4, 10 and 20 degrees c. aerobic plate counts and ph values were determined. total bacterial dna was extracted from oyster gill and bulk cells of  plate count media. the major bacterial species during fresh or different temperatures storage were determined by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). results: the initial aerobic plate count in oyster gill reached 6.70 log cfu g(-1). pcr-dgge fingerprinting analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region revealed that most of the strains in fresh oyster gill belonged to the genera lactococcus and enterobacter. the major spoilage bacteria at a storage temperature of 20 degrees c were leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, an uncultured bacterium, cytophaga fermentans, lactococcus lactis, pseudoalteromonas sp., enterococcus mundtii, clostridium difficile and an uncultured fusobacteria; those at 10 degrees c were lactococcus spp., lactobacillus curvatus, weissella confusa and c. difficile; those at 4 degrees c  were lactococcus, weissella, enterobacter and aeromonas. the other minor species  were l. curvatus, pseudomonas sp. and e. mundtii. lactococcus spp. was the most common main spoilage bacteria in oyster gill during chilled storage. conclusion:  pcr-dgge revealed the complexity of the bacterial microbiota and the major bacteria species in oyster gill for fresh and storage.

TI  == propionyl-coa dependent biosynthesis of 2-hydroxybutyrate containing polyhydroxyalkanoates in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == we have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyacid containing polyesters including polylactic acid (pla), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)], and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-2-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-2hb-co-la)] employing metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved clostridium propionicum propionyl-coa transferase  (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). in this study, we further engineered in vivo pla biosynthesis system in e. coli to synthesize 2hb-containing pha, in which propionyl-coa was used as precursor for 2-ketobutyrate that was converted into 2hb-coa by the sequential actions of lactococcus lactis (d)-2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (pane) and pct(cp) and then 2hb-coa was polymerized by phac1(ps6-19). the recombinant e. coli xl1-blue expressing the phac1437 gene, the pct540 gene, and the ralstonia eutropha prpe gene together with the pane gene could be grown to 0.66 g/l and successfully produced p(70 mol%3hb-co-18 mol%2hb-co-12 mol%la) up to the pha content of 66 wt% from 20 g/l of glucose, 2 g/l of 3hb and 1 g/l of sodium propionate. removal of the prpc gene in the chromosome of e. coli xl1-blue could increase the mole fraction of 2hb in copolymer, but the pha content was decreased. the metabolic engineering strategy reported here suggests that propionyl-coa can be successfully used as the precursor to provide pha synthase with 2hb-coa for the production of phas containing 2hb monomer.

TI  == biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates containing 2-hydroxybutyrate from unrelated carbon source by metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == we have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of polylactic acid (pla) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)] employing metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved clostridium propionicum propionyl-coa transferase (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). using this in vivo pla biosynthesis system, we presently report the biosynthesis of phas containing 2-hydroxybutyrate (2hb) monomer by direct fermentation of a metabolically engineered e. coli strain. the recombinant e. coli ldha mutant xldh strain expressing phac1( ps6-19) and pct(cp) was developed and cultured in a chemically  defined medium containing 20 g/l of glucose and varying concentrations of 2hb and 3hb. phas consisting of 2hb, 3hb, and a small fraction of lactate were synthesized. their monomer compositions were dependent on the concentrations of 2hb and 3hb added to the culture medium. even though the ldha gene was completely deleted in the chromosome of e. coli, up to 6 mol% of lactate was found to be incorporated into the polymer depending on the culture condition. in order to synthesize phas containing 2hb monomer without feeding 2hb into the culture medium, a heterologous metabolic pathway for the generation of 2hb from glucose was constructed via the citramalate pathway, in which 2-ketobutyrate is synthesized directly from pyruvate and acetyl-coa. introduction of the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 2hb dehydrogenase gene (pane) into e. coli allowed in vivo conversion of 2-ketobutyrate to 2hb. the metabolically engineered e. coli xldh strain expressing the phac1437, pct540, cima3.7, and leubcd genes together with the l. lactis il1403 pane gene successfully produced phas consisting of 2hb, 3hb, and a small fraction of lactate by varying the 3hb concentration in the culture medium. as the 3hb concentration in the medium increased the 3hb monomer fraction in the polymer, the polymer content increased. when ralstonia eutropha phaab genes were additionally expressed in this recombinant e. coli xldh strain, p(2hb-co-3hb-co-la) having small amounts of 2hb  and la monomers could also be produced from glucose as a sole carbon source. the  metabolic engineering strategy reported here should be useful for the production  of phas containing 2hb monomer.

TI  == bacterial diversity of darfiyeh, a lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  == in order to contribute to the preservation of the lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety  made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. three independent batches of darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (lab) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. in order to explore the darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. the latter included polymerase chain reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge), classical pcr and quantitative pcr. these methods revealed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus malodoratus, group d streptococcus sp., lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, clostridium sp./eubacterium tenue. real-time pcr  enabled quantification of e. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. the present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of lebanese artisanal dairy products.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16s rdna sequence analysis.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total dna extraction and purification procedure and pcr amplification of 16s rdna for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. these partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database  of ncbi. the identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. this analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as lactococcus lactis, streptococcus suis, lactobacillus plantarum, lact. casei, lact. alimentarium, and lact. delbruekii and clostridium sp. two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
