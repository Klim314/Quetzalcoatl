TI  == recurrent infective endocarditis due to aggregatibacter aphrophilus and staphylococcus lugdunensis.
AB  == uncommon microorganisms are increasingly being recognized as causative agents of  paediatric infectious endocarditis (ie). we report a 4-year old girl with congenital heart disease, who suffered from 2 ie episodes secondary to aggregatibacter aphrophilus (formerly haemophilus aphrophilus) and staphylococcus lugdunensis, both rarely reported pathogens in this age group. the patient was initially successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses, however removal of the contegra valved conduit during the second episode was required due to recurrence of fever and development of pulmonary embolism despite completion of antibiotic therapy. a. aphrohilus is a member of the fastidious gram negative microorganisms of the hacek group (haemophilus spp., aggregatibacter spp, cardiobaterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella kingae), that colonize the oropharynx and are a recognised cause of ie. prognosis of children with ie due to hacek group members varies, half of them suffering from complications and mortality rates of 10-12.5%. although s. lugdunensis belongs to coagulase negative staphylococci (cons), it behaves more like s. aureus species rather than cons. this microorganism is a well-described cause of  endocarditis in adult patients, associated with high requirements of surgical procedures and mortality (42-78%). in conclusion, paediatric ie can be caused by  uncommon microorganisms associated with severe complications and potential fatality. the isolation of s. lugdunensis or a. aphrophilus in febrile patients should be considered clinically relevant and cardiac involvement must be ruled out. those patients with proved ie will require prolonged intravenous antibiotic  courses and in complicated cases surgical intervention.

TI  == association between hacek bacteraemia and endocarditis.
AB  == we retrospectively examined medical records of 87 patients with bacteraemia caused by members of the hacek group (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter paraphrophilus, cardiobacterium spp., eikenella corrodens and kingella spp.) to determine whether endocarditis was present, as defined by the duke criteria. the  overall positive predictive value (ppv) of hacek bacteraemia for endocarditis was 60 %. the ppv varied with different hacek species from 0 % (e. corrodens) to 100  % (a. actinomycetemcomitans).

TI  == accurate identification of fastidious gram-negative rods: integration of both conventional phenotypic methods and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == background: accurate identification of fastidious gram-negative rods (gnr) by conventional phenotypic characteristics is a challenge for diagnostic microbiology. the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of molecular methods, e.g., 16s rrna gene sequence analysis for identification of fastidious gnr in the clinical microbiology laboratory. results: a total of 158 clinical isolates covering 20 genera and 50 species isolated from 1993 to 2010 were analyzed by comparing biochemical and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis based identification. 16s rrna gene homology analysis identified 148/158 (94%) of the isolates to species level, 9/158 (5%) to genus and 1/158 (1%) to family level. compared to 16s rrna gene sequencing as reference method, phenotypic identification correctly identified 64/158 (40%) isolates to species level, mainly aggregatibacter aphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, pasteurella multocida, and 21/158 (13%) isolates correctly to genus level, notably capnocytophaga sp.; 73/158 (47%) of the isolates were not identified or misidentified. conclusions: we herein propose an efficient strategy for accurate identification of fastidious gnr in the clinical microbiology laboratory by integrating both conventional phenotypic methods and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we conclude that 16s rrna gene sequencing is an effective means for identification of fastidious gnr, which are not readily identified by conventional phenotypic methods.

TI  == kingella kingae endocarditis: a rare case of mitral valve perforation.
AB  == kingella kingae, a hacek (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae) organism, is a common resident of the upper airway in children; it has been associated with endocarditis in children with pre-existing heart conditions. this case report describes k. kingae endocarditis  leading to valvular damage in a previously healthy 18-month-old child. our patient developed a k. kingae bacteremia that was later complicated by meningitis, septic embolic stroke, and endocarditis of the mitral valve, leading  to perforation of the posterolateral leaflet. the patient was initially treated conservatively with cefotaxime but, subsequently, required a mitral valve repair  with a pericardial patch and annuloplasty. this report draws attention to the need for clinicians to be aware of the potentially serious complications of k. kingae infection in young children. if k. kingae infection is suspected then therapy should be initiated promptly with a beta-lactam, followed by early echocardiographic assessment. this case also highlights the lack of specific guidelines available for k. kingae endocarditis.

TI  == identification of hacek clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. we assessed this technology for the identification of 103 haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae (hacek) clinical isolates and 20 haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. ninety-three percent of hacek organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.

TI  == [endocarditis due to aggregatibacter (formerly: actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, a bacterium that grows in characteristic star-shaped colonies].
AB  == a 72-year-old man, having had an artificial valve for almost 20 years now, presented with tiredness that had persisted for several weeks and reported weight loss of 5 kg. in more recent days he experienced fever and cold shivers, and an associated dry cough. bearing in mind the potential for endocarditis, blood cultures were grown. in this, we identified a small, gram-negative rod with a small, smooth, raised colony that grew slowly. we considered a micro-organism from the 'hacek group', which is a group of micro-organisms including haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae and aggregatibacter (formerly: actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans. more careful observation revealed that the bacteria formed star-shaped colonies, proving that a. actinomycetemcomitans was the cause of this non-acute endocarditis. the patient received antibiotic treatment. because non-acute endocarditis is often caused by hidden abnormalities in the mouth or teeth and a. actinomycetemcomitans plays an important role in severe cases of peridontitis, a dental surgeon was consulted. the dental surgeon diagnosed multifocal peridontitis and treated the patient, who was able to leave the hospital after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  == myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. there are three myeloperoxidase isoforms:  mpo i, mpo ii and mpo iii. we examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena and streptococcus sanguis. isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-a-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in mpo i and diminished in mpo iii. exceptionally, serum-opsonized a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests  based upon myeloperoxidase.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.
