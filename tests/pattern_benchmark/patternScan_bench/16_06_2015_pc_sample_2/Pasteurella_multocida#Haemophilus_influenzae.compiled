TI  - Bacterial periplasmic sialic acid-binding proteins exhibit a conserved binding site.
AB  - Sialic acids are a family of related nine-carbon sugar acids that play important  roles in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. These sialic acids are incorporated/decorated onto lipooligosaccharides as terminal sugars in multiple bacteria to evade the host immune system. Many pathogenic bacteria scavenge sialic acids from their host and use them for molecular mimicry. The first step of this process is the transport of sialic acid to the cytoplasm, which often takes place using a tripartite ATP-independent transport system consisting of a periplasmic binding protein and a membrane transporter. In this paper, the structural characterization of periplasmic binding proteins from the pathogenic bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum, Pasteurella multocida and Vibrio cholerae and their thermodynamic characterization are reported. The binding affinities of several mutations in the Neu5Ac binding site of the Haemophilus influenzae protein are also reported. The structure and the thermodynamics of the binding of sugars suggest that all of these proteins have a very well conserved binding pocket and similar binding affinities. A significant conformational change occurs when these proteins bind the sugar. While the C1 carboxylate has been identified as the primary binding site, a second conserved hydrogen-bonding network is involved in the initiation and stabilization of the conformational states.
TI  - KpsC and KpsS are retaining 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) transferases involved in synthesis of bacterial capsules.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are high-molecular-mass cell-surface polysaccharides, that act as important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. Several clinically important Gram-negative pathogens share similar systems for CPS biosynthesis and export; examples include Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Pasteurella multocida. Each CPS contains a serotype-specific repeat-unit structure, but the glycans all possess a lipid moiety at their reducing termini. In E. coli and N. meningitidis, the predominant lipid is a lysophosphatidylglycerol moiety that is attached to the repeat-unit domain of the CPS via multiple residues of 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo), referred to as a poly-Kdo linker. The Kdo residues are beta-linked, suggesting that they are synthesized by retaining glycosyltransferases. To date, the only characterized Kdo transferases are the inverting enzymes that catalyze the alpha-linkages found in lipopolysaccharide. Here, we identify two conserved proteins from CPS assembly systems, KpsC and KpsS, as the beta-Kdo-transferases and demonstrate in vitro reconstitution of poly-Kdo linker assembly on a fluorescent phosphatidylglycerol acceptor. KpsS adds the first Kdo residue, and this reaction product is then extended by KpsC. Cross-complementation experiments demonstrate that the E. coli and N. meningitidis protein homologs are functionally conserved.
TI  - Conserved glycolipid termini in capsular polysaccharides synthesized by ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathways in Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial capsules are surface layers made of long-chain polysaccharides. They are anchored to the outer membrane of many Gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pasteurella multocida. Capsules protect pathogens from host defenses including complement-mediated killing and phagocytosis and therefore represent a major virulence factor. Capsular polysaccharides are synthesized by enzymes located in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane and are then translocated to the cell surface. Whereas the enzymes that synthesize the polysaccharides have been studied in detail, the structure and biosynthesis of the anchoring elements have not been definitively resolved. Here we determine the structure of the glycolipid attached to the reducing terminus of the polysialic acid capsular polysaccharides from E. coli K1 and N. meningitidis group B and the heparosan-like capsular polysaccharide from E. coli K5. All possess the same unique glycolipid terminus consisting of a lyso-phosphatidylglycerol moiety with a beta-linked poly-(3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid) (poly-Kdo) linker attached to the reducing terminus of the capsular polysaccharide.
TI  - Ocular penetration of topical antibiotics: study on the penetration of chloramphenicol, tobramycin and netilmicin into the anterior chamber after topical administration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare penetration in the aqueous humour of topically applied antibiotics. DESIGN: Randomized prospective study, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Perugia, Italy PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing cataract surgery. METHODS: One hundred twenty-two patients were included: 14 received one drop of chloramphenicol suspension; 12 one application of chloramphenicol gel; 11 one drop of netilmicin suspension; 13 one drop of tobramycin suspension; 37 repeated instillations of chloramphenicol suspension every 10 min for a total of four drops; and 35 repeated instillations of chloramphenicol gel every 10 min for a total of four drops. Samples were taken immediately before surgery from the anterior chamber in order to determine the antibiotic by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples were taken 45-190 min after the eye drops were instilled. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular penetration of chloramphenicol, netilmicin and tobramicyn. RESULTS: After a single administration, netilmicin and tobramycin were undetectable, whereas the chloramphenicol suspension reached a mean concentration of 0.23 +/- 0.21 mug/mL, and the chloramphenicol gel a mean concentration of 0.13 +/- 0.14 mug/mL. After repeated administrations, the mean concentrations of the chloramphenicol suspension and gel were 0.60 +/- 0.26 mug/mL and 0.58 +/- 0.18 mug/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tobramycin and netilmicin do not reach detectable concentrations, whereas chloramphenicol, after multiple administrations, reaches concentrations that are effective against Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This means that chloramphenicol can be rationally used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections supported by sensitive germs.
TI  - Identification of the lic1ABCD operon that controls the phase-variable expression of phosphorylcholine on lipopolysaccharide from Avibacterium paragallinarum.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) is an important virulence factor found on the surface of many mucosal pathogens and its expression enhances bacterial colonization on mucous membranes and reduces susceptibility to antimicrobial peptides. Whole-genome sequencing analyses showed that Avibacterium paragallinarum contained an operon with strong sequence similarity to the lic1ABCD operon from Haemophilus influenzae and the pcgDABC operon from Pasteurella multocida; both operons are involved in metabolism and addition of ChoP on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Western immunoblot analysis with ChoP-specific monoclonal antibody showed that ChoP is present on LPS of Av. paragallinarum and the expression of ChoP is controlled by phase variation mediated by the number of 5'-CAAT-3' tetranucleotide tandem repeats within the coding region of the lic1A gene. The number of tetranucleotide repeats varied widely among strains, and variation in the number of repeats was observed following in vivo passage but not in vitro passage. Antimicrobial susceptibility assays showed that ChoP expression decreased susceptibility of Av. paragallinarum to chicken antimicrobial peptide fowlicidin-1. This is the first report showing that ChoP is present on LPS from Av. paragallinarum and that Av. paragallinarum contains a phase-variable gene. These results could be valuable for understanding the mechanism of pathogenicity of Av. paragallinarum.
TI  - Haemophilus parainfluenzae has a limited core lipopolysaccharide repertoire with  no phase variation.
AB  - Cell surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a well characterized virulence determinant for the human pathogen Haemophilus influenzae, so an investigation of LPS in the less pathogenic Haemophilus parainfluenzae could yield important insights. Using a panel of 18 commensal H. parainfluenzae isolates we demonstrate that the set of genes for inner core LPS biosynthesis largely resembles that of H. influenzae, with an additional heptosyltransferase I gene similar to waaC from Pasteurella multocida. Inner core LPS structure is therefore likely to be largely conserved across the two Haemophilus species. Outer core LPS biosynthetic genes are much less prevalent in H. parainfluenzae, although homologues of the H. influenzae LPS genes lpsB, non-phase variable lic2A and lgtC, and losA1, losB1 and lic2C are found in certain isolates. Immunoblotting using antibodies directed against selected LPS epitopes was consistent with these data. We found no evidence for tetranucleotide repeat-mediated phase variation in H. parainfluenzae. Phosphocholine, a phase variable H. influenzae LPS epitope that has been implicated in disease, was absent in H. parainfluenzae LPS as were the respective (lic1) biosynthetic genes. The introduction of the lic1 genes into H. parainfluenzae led to the phase variable incorporation of phosphocholine into its LPS. Differences in LPS structure between Haemophilus species could affect interactions at the bacterial-host interface and therefore the pathogenic potential of these bacteria.
TI  - The OmpA family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  - The OmpA family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in the outer membrane of mainly Gram-negative bacteria. OmpA proteins are characterized by an N-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. The C-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. Escherichia coli OmpA is the best characterized of the proteins. Other well-characterized OmpA-equivalent proteins from pathogenic bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF, Haemophilus influenzae P5, Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpA, and Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP). OmpA from the veterinary pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica, Haemophilus parasuis, Leptospira interrogans, and Pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. Among many of the pathogenic bacteria, OmpA proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. Alternatively, OmpA family proteins can serve as targets of the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. In several cases, OmpA proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.
TI  - Proteobacterial ArfA peptides are synthesized from non-stop messenger RNAs.
AB  - The translation of non-stop mRNA (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. In eubacteria, the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes from non-stop mRNA in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. During rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. Escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the ArfA peptide. The E. coli arfA message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by RNase III to produce a non-stop transcript. Therefore, ArfA levels are controlled by tmRNA through ssrA-peptide tagging and proteolysis. Here, we examine whether ArfA homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by RNase III and tmRNA. We searched 431 arfA coding sequences for mRNA secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in their 3'-coding regions. The arfA hairpins from Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio fischeri, and Pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by RNase III as predicted, whereas the hairpin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mRNA. Each ArfA homologue is ssrA-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type E. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmRNA. Together, these findings show that ArfA synthesis from non-stop mRNA is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. This strategy ensures that ArfA homologues are only deployed when the tmRNA system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes.
TI  - The role of lipooligosaccharide phosphorylcholine in colonization and pathogenesis of Histophilus somni in cattle.
AB  - Histophilus somni is a Gram-negative bacterium and member of the Pasteurellaceae  that is responsible for respiratory disease and other systemic infections in cattle. One of the bacterium's virulence factors is antigenic phase variation of its lipooligosaccharide (LOS). LOS antigenic variation may occur through variation in composition or structure of glycoses or their substitutions, such as phosphorylcholine (ChoP). However, the role of ChoP in the pathogenesis of H. somni disease has not been established. In Haemophilus influenzae ChoP on the LOS binds to platelet activating factor on epithelial cells, promoting bacterial colonization of the host upper respiratory tract. However, ChoP is not expressed in the blood as it also binds C-reactive protein, resulting in complement activation and killing of the bacteria. In order to simulate the susceptibility of calves with suppressed immunity due to stress or previous infection, calves were challenged with bovine herpes virus-1 or dexamethazone 3 days prior to challenge with H. somni. Following challenge, expression of ChoP on the LOS of 2 different H. somni strains was associated with colonization of the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, lack of ChoP expression was associated with bacteria recovered from systemic sites. Histopathology of cardiac tissue from myocarditis revealed lesions containing bacterial clusters that appeared similar to a biofilm. Furthermore, some respiratory cultures contained substantial numbers of Pasteurella multocida, which were not present on preculture screens. Subsequent biofilm experiments have shown that H. somni and P. multocida grow equally well together in a biofilm, suggesting a commensal relationship may exist between the two species. Our results also showed that ChoP contributed to, but was not required for, adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells. In conclusion, expression of ChoP on H. somni LOS contributed to colonization of the bacteria to the host upper respiratory tract, but phase variable loss of ChoP expression may help the bacteria survive systemically.
TI  - Crystal structure and immunogenicity of the class C acid phosphatase from Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is a pathogen of veterinary and medical importance. Here, we report the 1.85A resolution crystal structure of the class C acid phosphatase from this organism (denoted rPmCCAP). The structure shows that rPmCCAP exhibits the same haloacid dehalogenase fold and dimeric assembly as the class C enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae. Formation of the dimer in solution is demonstrated using analytical ultracentrifugation. The active site is devoid of a magnesium ion due to the presence of citrate in the crystallization buffer. Absence of the metal ion minimally perturbs the active site structure, which suggests that the main role of the ion is to balance the negative charge of the substrate rather than stabilize the active site structure. The crystal lattice displays unusual crystal packing involving the C-terminal polyhistidine tag mimicking the substrate. Steady-state kinetic constants are determined for the substrates NMN, 5'-AMP, 3'-AMP, 2'-AMP, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The highest catalytic efficiency is observed with NMN. The production of polyclonal anti-rPmCCAP antibodies is demonstrated, and these antibodies are shown to cross-react with the H. influenzae class C phosphatase. The antibodies are used to detect PmCCAP in clinical P. multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica strains cultured from infected animals.
TI  - Contribution of ROB-1 and PBP3 mutations to the resistance phenotype of a beta-lactamase-positive amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-resistant Haemophilus influenzae carrying plasmid pB1000 in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: plasmid pB1000 bearing bla(ROB-1) is responsible for high-level beta-lactam resistance in Haemophilus influenzae as well as in Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus parasuis isolates from Spain. Here, we explore the presence of ROB-1 in Italy and investigate the relative contribution of penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3) mutations and ROB-1 to the beta-lactam resistance phenotype in H. influenzae. METHODS: the collection of the Italian Reference Laboratory of H. influenzae was investigated for ROB-1-positive isolates between 2004 and 2009. H. influenzae Rd KW20 was used as recipient for pB1000 electroporation and for mutagenesis of the ftsI gene encoding PBP3. RESULTS: the presence of plasmid pB1000 in a non-typeable H. influenzae isolated in Italy, BB1059, is reported in this work. This strain is not genetically related to the H. influenzae clinical isolates bearing pB1000 described in Spain. The sequence of ftsI from BB1059 revealed several mutations in the predicted amino acid sequence of PBP3. To determine the relative contribution of pB1000 and PBP3 mutations to the beta-lactam resistance phenotype of BB1059, H. influenzae Rd KW20 was transformed with ftsI and/or pB1000 from BB1059. beta-Lactam resistance profiles revealed the additive effect of pB1000 and PBP3 mutations conferring resistance to beta-lactams, including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: intra-European spread of plasmid pB1000 among H. influenzae has been shown. The coexistence of plasmid pB1000 and mutations in PBP3 produces an additive resistance phenotype in H. influenzae.
TI  - [Usefulness and limit of Gram staining smear examination].
AB  - Gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. It yields results much faster than culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. However, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by Gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. Therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from Gram staining smears is also present. The Gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. Species of Gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. Gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. Even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive diplococcus, forming Gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling Streptococcus pneumoniae. Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in the sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Capnocytophaga sp. is a Gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling Fusobacterium nucleatum.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates with plasmid pB1000 bearing blaROB-1: fitness cost and interspecies dissemination.
AB  - Plasmid pB1000 is a mobilizable replicon bearing the bla(ROB-1) beta-lactamase gene that we have recently described in Haemophilus parasuis and Pasteurella multocida animal isolates. Here we report the presence of pB1000 and a derivative plasmid, pB1000', in four Haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates of human origin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed unrelated patterns in all strains, indicating that the existence of pB1000 in H. influenzae isolates is not the consequence of clonal dissemination. The replicon can be transferred both by transformation and by conjugation into H. influenzae, giving rise to recipients resistant to ampicillin and cefaclor (MICs, > or =64 microg/ml). Stability experiments showed that pB1000 is stable in H. influenzae without antimicrobial pressure for at least 60 generations. Competition experiments between isogenic H. influenzae strains with and without pB1000 revealed a competitive disadvantage of 9% per 10 generations for the transformant versus the recipient. The complete nucleotide sequences of nine pB1000 plasmids from human and animal isolates, as well as the epidemiological data, suggest that animal isolates belonging to the Pasteurellaceae act as an antimicrobial resistance reservoir for H. influenzae. Further, since P. multocida is the only member of this family that can colonize both humans and animals, we propose that P. multocida is the vehicle for the transport of pB1000 between animal- and human-adapted members of the Pasteurellaceae.
TI  - New plasmid tools for genetic analysis of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other pasteurellaceae.
AB  - We have generated a set of plasmids, based on the mobilizable shuttle vector pMIDG100, which can be used as tools for genetic manipulation of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other members of the Pasteurellaceae. A tandem reporter plasmid, pMC-Tandem, carrying promoterless xylE and gfpmut3 genes downstream of a multiple-cloning site (MCS), can be used for identification of transcriptional regulators and conditions which favor gene expression from different cloned promoters. The ability to detect transcriptional regulators using the tandem reporter system was validated in A. pleuropneumoniae using the cloned rpoE (sigma(E)) promoter (P). The resulting plasmid, pMCrpoEP, was used to identify a mutant defective in production of RseA, the negative regulator of sigma(E), among a bank of random transposon mutants, as well as to detect induction of sigma(E) following exposure of A. pleuropneumoniae to ethanol or heat shock. pMCsodCP, carrying the cloned sodC promoter of A. pleuropneumoniae, was functional in A. pleuropneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parasuis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida. Two general expression vectors, pMK-Express and pMC-Express, which differ in their antibiotic resistance markers (kanamycin and chloramphenicol, respectively), were constructed for the Pasteurellaceae. Both plasmids have the A. pleuropneumoniae sodC promoter upstream of the gfpmut3 gene and an extended MCS. Replacement of gfpmut3 with a gene of interest allows complementation and heterologous gene expression, as evidenced by expression of the Haemophilus ducreyi nadV gene in A. pleuropneumoniae, rendering the latter NAD independent.
TI  - [Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection 22 years after splenectomy].
AB  - A 25-year-old man undergoing splenectomy at 3 years of age to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura but no history of Streptococcus pneumonia vaccination, and reporting high fever, nausea, and headache developed purpura, confusion, and hypotension the next day and was admitted. Detailed examination showed disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple-organ dysfunction. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed pneumonia and pleural effusion. Blood culture was positive for S. pneumoniae. Gram staining of sputa yielded numerous white blood cells and gram-negative rods, and sputa culture was positive for Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus influenzae. The medical history and presence of these organisms yielded a diagnosis of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI), and the patient responded to treatment with a combination of benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, and meropenem. This case suggests that patients with a history of splenectomy may benefit from vaccination for S. pneumoniae and adequate education on OPSI.
TI  - [Fatty acid composition of cells and lipopolysaccliarides of Mannheimia haemolytica, Mannheimia glucosida and Bibersteinia trehalosi strains].
AB  - The Mannheimia haemolytica, Mannheimia glucosida and Bibersteinia trehalosi strains and the similar fatty acid composition of cells with domination of C(16:1) and C(16:0), which were in almost equal quantities, C(14:0 and C(18:1) + C(18:2). The fatty acid composition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the studied bacteria had no essential differences too. It was mainly represented by C(14:0) and 3-OH-C(14:0) which consisted of more than 80% of all LPS fatty acids. C(12:0), C(16:1) and C(16:0) were presented in LPS in small quantities. The M. haemolytica, M. glucosida and B. trehalosi strains did not differ essentially by fatty acid compositions of cells and LPS from earlier studied strains of genera Pasteurella (P. multocida), Haemophilus (H. influenzae and other species), Actinobacillus (A. pleuropneumoniae). This shows the close phylogenetic relationship of the mentioned bacteria and significance of investigated signs as chemotaxonomic markers for differentiation of taxons of the above genus level. The paper is presented in Russian.
TI  - Host-pathogen interactions of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae with porcine lung and tracheal epithelial cells.
AB  - Host-pathogen interactions are of great importance in understanding the pathogenesis of infectious microorganisms. We developed in vitro models to study the host-pathogen interactions of porcine respiratory tract pathogens using two immortalized epithelial cell lines, namely, the newborn pig trachea (NPTr) and St. Jude porcine lung (SJPL) cell lines. We first studied the interactions of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, an important swine pathogen, using these models. Under conditions where cytotoxicity was absent or low, we showed that A. pleuropneumoniae adheres to both cell lines, stimulating the induction of NF-kappaB. The NPTr cells consequently secrete interleukin 8, while the SJPL cells do not, since they are deprived of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. Cell death ultimately occurs by necrosis, not apoptosis. The transcriptomic profile of A. pleuropneumoniae was determined after contact with the porcine lung epithelial cells by using DNA microarrays. Genes such as tadB and rcpA, members of a putative adhesin locus, and a gene whose product has high homology to the Hsf autotransporter adhesin of Haemophilus influenzae were upregulated, as were the genes pgaBC, involved in biofilm biosynthesis, while capsular polysaccharide-associated genes were downregulated. The in vitro models also proved to be efficient with other swine pathogens, such as Actinobacillus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Pasteurella multocida. Our results demonstrate that interactions of A. pleuropneumoniae with host epithelial cells seem to involve complex cross talk which results in regulation of various bacterial genes, including some coding for putative adhesins. Furthermore, our data demonstrate the potential of these in vitro models in studying the host-pathogen interactions of other porcine respiratory tract pathogens.
TI  - Pattern classification of phylogeny signals.
AB  - In this paper we propose the minimum entropy clustering (MEC) method for clustering genes based on their phylogenetic signals. This entropy based method will cluster two genes together when their concatenation can decrease the entropy. An integral feature of MEC is that it chooses the number of clusters automatically, which is a major advantage over the other methods. Our simulation results show that this method is quite successful in clustering genes with a common phylogeny.
TI  - Molecular phylogenetic analysis of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family enzymes are of particular interest for creating  universal phylogenetic trees and understanding the gene flow as these enzymes perform the basic and analogous biochemical function of protein synthesis in all extant organisms. Among them, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Trp-RS) plays a foremost role in phylogeny owing to the close relationship with tyrosine-tRNA synthetase. In this study, the sequence of the gene Trp-RS was amplified using degenerated adenylation domain primers in the periodontal bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The sequence of the cloned PCR amplicon confirmed the adenylation domain sequence with glutamic acid residue, which is absent in five other oral bacteria used in this study as well as in a number of other bacteria described in the database. The Trp-RS sequence analysis prevailed the identify elements such as Rossmann-fold sequence and tRNA(Trp) binding domains including acceptor stem and anticodon. A theoretical model of Trp-RS of A. actinomycetemcomitans was generated. Guided docking of the ligand tryptophanyl-5'-AMP revealed a highly identical active site in comparison with the bacterial template. The phylogenetic positioning of Trp-RS among a group of oral bacterial species revealed that A. actinomycetemcomitans is closely related to Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi and Pasteurella multocida.
TI  - Membrane morphology and leukotoxin secretion are associated with a novel membrane protein of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria display either a flat or an irregular outer membrane. The  periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans has an irregular outer membrane. We have identified a gene that is associated with the biogenesis of this morphology. The gene is part of a three-gene operon and codes for a 141-kDa protein designated morphogenesis protein C (MorC), which is conserved in several gram-negative bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae and Pasteurella multocida. Insertional inactivation of this gene resulted in the conversion of an irregularly shaped membrane to a flat membrane. Associated with this morphological change were the autoaggregation of the bacteria during planktonic growth and a concomitant increase in the surface hydrophobicity of the bacterium. The absence of MorC also resulted in the loss of the secretion of leukotoxin but not the ltxA transcription. Our findings suggest that MorC is critical for membrane morphology and leukotoxin secretion in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Comparative functional genomic analysis of Pasteurellaceae adhesins using phage display.
AB  - The Pasteurellaceae contain a number of important animal pathogens. Although related, the various members of this family cause a diversity of pathology in a wide variety of organ systems. Adhesion is an important virulence factor in bacterial infections. Surprisingly little is known about the adhesins of the Pasteurellaceae. To attempt to identify the genes coding for adhesins to some key components of the hosts extracellular matrix molecules, phage display libraries of fragmented genomic DNA from Haemophilus influenzae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were prepared in the phage display vector pG8SAET. The libraries were screened against human or porcine fibronectin, serum albumin or a commercial extracellular matrix containing type IV collagen, laminin and heparin sulphate. Four genes encoding putative adhesins were identified. These genes code for: (i) a 34 kDa human serum albumin binding protein from Haemophilus influenzae; (ii) a 12.8 kDa fibronectin-binding protein from Pasteurella multocida; (iii) a 13.7 kDa fibronectin-binding protein from A. actinomycetemcomitans; (iv) a 9.5 kDa serum albumin-binding protein from A. pleuropneumoniae. None of these genes have previously been proposed to code for adhesins. The applications of phage display with whole bacterial genomes to identify genes encoding novel adhesins in this family of bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Evolution of competence and DNA uptake specificity in the Pasteurellaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many bacteria can take up DNA, but the evolutionary history and function of natural competence and transformation remain obscure. The sporadic distribution of competence suggests it is frequently lost and/or gained, but this has not been examined in an explicitly phylogenetic context. Additional insight may come from the sequence specificity of uptake by species such as Haemophilus influenzae, where a 9 bp uptake signal sequence (USS) repeat is both highly overrepresented in the genome and needed for efficient DNA uptake. We used the distribution of competence genes and DNA uptake specificity in H. influenzae's family, the Pasteurellaceae, to examine the ancestry of competence. RESULTS: A phylogeny of the Pasteurellaceae based on 12 protein coding genes from species with sequenced genomes shows two strongly supported subclades: the Hin subclade (H. influenzae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, and H. somnus), and the Apl subclade (A. pleuropneumoniae, M. haemolytica, and H. ducreyi). All species contained homologues of all known H. influenzae competence genes, consistent with an ancestral origin of competence. Competence gene defects were identified in three species (H. somnus, H. ducreyi and M. haemolytica); each appeared to be of recent origin. The assumption that USS arise by mutation rather than copying was first confirmed using alignments of H. influenzae proteins with distant homologues. Abundant USS-like repeats were found in all eight Pasteurellacean genomes; the repeat consensuses of species in the Hin subclade were identical to that of H. influenzae (AAGTGCGGT), whereas members of the Apl subclade shared the consensus ACAAGCGGT. All species' USSs had the strong consensus and flanking AT-rich repeats of H. influenzae USSs. DNA uptake and competition experiments demonstrated that the Apl-type repeat is a true USS distinct from the Hin-type USS: A. pleuropneumoniae preferentially takes up DNA fragments containing the Apl-type USS over both H. influenzae and unrelated DNAs, and H. influenzae prefers its own USS over the Apl type. CONCLUSION: Competence and DNA uptake specificity are ancestral properties of the Pasteurellaceae, with divergent USSs and uptake specificity distinguishing only the two major subclades. The conservation of most competence genes over the approximately 350 million year history of the family suggests that lineages that lose competence may be evolutionary dead ends.
TI  - Isolation and sequencing of a temperate transducing phage for Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - A temperate bacteriophage (F108) has been isolated through mitomycin C induction  of a Pasteurella multocida serogroup A strain. F108 has a typical morphology of the family Myoviridae, presenting a hexagonal head and a long contractile tail. F108 is able to infect all P. multocida serogroup A strains tested but not those belonging to other serotypes. Bacteriophage F108, the first P. multocida phage sequenced so far, presents a 30,505-bp double-stranded DNA genome with cohesive ends (CTTCCTCCCC cos site). The F108 genome shows the highest homology with those of Haemophilus influenzae HP1 and HP2 phages. Furthermore, an F108 prophage attachment site in the P. multocida chromosome has been established to be inside a gene encoding tRNA(Leu). By using several chromosomal markers that are spread along the P. multocida chromosome, it has been demonstrated that F108 is able to perform generalized transduction. This fact, together with the absence of pathogenic genes in the F108 genome, makes this bacteriophage a valuable tool for P. multocida genetic manipulation.
TI  - Characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (GshF) of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ECL) and glutathione synthetase (GS) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ECL is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas GS enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain ATP-grasp fold. This generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the Pasteurellaceae member Haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain Gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed GshF), as has been reported recently for the Gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. Here, we show that yet another member of the Pasteurellaceae family, Pasteurella multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and GshF-driven biosynthesis. Domain architecture analysis shows that this P. multocida GshF bifunctional ligase contains an N-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ECL-like domain followed by a typical ATP-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known GS ligases. Recombinant P. multocida GshF overexpresses as an approximately 85-kDa protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. The gamma-ECL activity of GshF is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (K(i) = 13.6 mM). Furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of GshF proteins.
TI  - Unexpected functional diversity among FadR fatty acid transcriptional regulatory  proteins.
AB  - The FadR protein of Escherichia coli has been shown to play a dual role in transcription of the genes of bacterial fatty acid metabolism. The protein acts as a repressor of beta-oxidation and an activator of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. FadR DNA binding is antagonized by long chain acyl-CoAs, and thus FadR acts as a sensor of fatty acid availability in the environment. When viewed from a genomic viewpoint, FadR proteins are unusual in that the DNA binding domain is very highly conserved among FadR-containing bacteria, whereas the C-terminal acyl-CoA binding domain shows only weak conservation. To further our understanding of the role of FadR in bacterial lipid metabolism we have examined the in vivo and in vitro properties of a diverse set of FadR proteins expressed in E. coli. In addition to E. coli FadR the proteins examined were those of Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus influenzae. These FadR proteins were found to differ markedly in their effects on repression and induction of beta-oxidation in E. coli and in their acyl-CoA binding abilities as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. The E. coli and S. enterica proteins were the most similar, although they differed in their effects on utilization of oleic acid and acyl-CoA binding affinities, whereas the P. multocida and H. influenzae proteins showed only weak repression and poor acyl-CoA binding affinities. The V. cholerae FadR was strikingly superior to the other proteins in the amplitude of its regulatory response, and it bound long chain acyl-CoAs appreciably more strongly than the E. coli and S. enterica proteins. The significance of these findings is discussed in view of the protein sequences and the physiological niches occupied by these organisms.
TI  - PnuC and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The utilization pathway for the uptake of NAD and nicotinamide riboside was previously characterized for Haemophilus influenzae. We now report on the cellular location, topology, and substrate specificity of PnuC. pnuC of H. influenzae is only distantly related to pnuC of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. When E. coli PnuC was expressed in an H. influenzae pnuC mutant, it was able to take up only nicotinamide riboside and not nicotinamide mononucleotide. Therefore, we postulated that PnuC transporters in general possess specificity for nicotinamide riboside. Earlier studies showed that 3-aminopyridine derivatives (e.g., 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide) are inhibitory for H. influenzae growth. By testing characterized strains with mutations in the NAD utilization pathway, we show that 3-aminopyridine riboside is inhibitory to H. influenzae and is taken up by the NAD-processing and nicotinamide riboside route. 3-Aminopyridine riboside is utilized effectively in a pnuC+ background. In addition, we demonstrate that 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide resynthesis is produced by NadR. 3-Aminopyridine riboside-resistant H. influenzae isolates were characterized, and mutations in nadR could be detected. We also tested other species of the family Pasteurellaceae, Pasteurella multocida and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and found that 3-aminopyridine riboside does not act as a growth inhibitor; hence, 3-aminopyridine riboside represents an anti-infective agent with a very narrow host range.
TI  - Genetic organisation of the capsule transport gene region from Haemophilus paragallinarum.
AB  - The region involved in export of the capsule polysaccharides to the cell surface  of Haemophilus paragallinarum was cloned and the genetic organisation determined. Degenerate primers designed from sequence alignment of the capsule transport genes of Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were used to amplify a 2.6 kb fragment containing a segment of the H. paragallinarum capsule transport gene locus. This fragment was used as a digoxigenin labelled probe to isolate the complete H. paragallinarum capsule transport gene locus from genomic DNA. The sequence of the cloned DNA was determined and analysis revealed the presence of four genes, each showing high homology with known capsule transport genes. The four genes were designated hctA, B, C and D (for H. paragallinarum capsule transport genes) and the predicted products of these genes likely encode an ATP-dependent export system responsible for transport of the capsule polysaccharides to the cell surface, possibly a member of a super family designated ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters.
TI  - Partial analysis of the genomes of two nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae otitis  media isolates.
AB  - In 1995, The Institute for Genomic Research completed the genomic sequence of a rough derivative of Haemophilus influenzae serotype d, strain KW20. This sequence, though extremely useful in understanding the basic biology of H. influenzae, has yet to provide significant insight into our understanding of disease caused by nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI), because serotype d strains are not generally pathogens. In contrast, NTHI strains are frequently mucosal pathogens and are the primary pathogens of chronic otitis media as well as a significant cause of acute otitis media in children. Thus, it is of great importance to further understand their biology. We used a DNA-based microarray approach to identify genes present in a clinical isolate of NTHI that were absent from strain Rd. We also sequenced the genome of a second NTHI isolate from a child with chronic otitis media to threefold coverage and then used an array of bioinformatics tools to identify genes present in this NTHI strain but absent from strain Rd. These methods were complementary in approach and results. We identified, in both strains, homologues of H. influenzae lav, an autotransported protein of unknown function; tnaA, which encodes tryptophanase; as well as a homologue of Pasteurella multocida tsaA, which encodes an alkyl peroxidase that may play a role in protection against reactive oxygen species. We also identified a number of putative restriction-modification systems, bacteriophage genes and transposon-related genes. These data provide new insight that complements and extends our ongoing analysis of NTHI virulence determinants.
TI  - Evolutionary stability of DNA uptake signal sequences in the Pasteurellaceae.
AB  - The DNA-uptake signal sequence (USS) of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae is highly over-represented in its genome (1,471 copies of the core sequence AAGTGCGGT), and DNA fragments containing USS are preferentially taken up by competent cells. Because this bias favors uptake of conspecific DNA, USSs are often considered a kind of mate recognition system in bacteria, acting as species-specific barriers against uptake of unrelated DNA. However, the H. influenzae USS is highly over-represented in the genomes of three otherwise-divergent Pasteurellaceae species (Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 927, 1,205, and 1,760 copies, respectively), suggesting that USSs do not always limit exchange. USSs in all these genomes are mainly in coding regions and show no orientation bias around the chromosome, weakening proposed USS functions in transcription termination and chromosome replication. Alignment of homologous genes was used to determine evolutionary relationships between individual USSs. Most H. influenzae USSs were found to have perfect or imperfect homologs (USS at the same location) in at least one other species, and most USSs in the other species had perfect or imperfect homologs in H. influenzae. These homologies suggest that the use of a common USS is due to inheritance of the USS-based uptake system from a common ancestor of the Pasteurellaceae, and it indicates that individual USSs can be evolutionarily stable elements of their genomes. The pattern is consistent with a molecular drive model of USS evolution, with new USSs arising by mutation and preferentially spread to new genomes by the biased DNA-uptake system.
TI  - Biased distribution of DNA uptake sequences towards genome maintenance genes.
AB  - Repeated sequence signatures are characteristic features of all genomic DNA. We have made a rigorous search for repeat genomic sequences in the human pathogens Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae and found that by far the most frequent 9-10mers residing within coding regions are the DNA uptake sequences (DUS) required for natural genetic transformation. More importantly, we found a significantly higher density of DUS within genes involved in DNA repair, recombination, restriction-modification and replication than in any other annotated gene group in these organisms. Pasteurella multocida also displayed high frequencies of a putative DUS identical to that previously identified in H.influenzae and with a skewed distribution towards genome maintenance genes, indicating that this bacterium might be transformation competent under certain conditions. These results imply that the high frequency of DUS in genome maintenance genes is conserved among phylogenetically divergent species and thus are of significant biological importance. Increased DUS density is expected to enhance DNA uptake and the over-representation of DUS in genome maintenance genes might reflect facilitated recovery of genome preserving functions. For example, transient and beneficial increase in genome instability can be allowed during pathogenesis simply through loss of antimutator genes, since these DUS-containing sequences will be preferentially recovered. Furthermore, uptake of such genes could provide a mechanism for facilitated recovery from DNA damage after genotoxic stress.
TI  - Characterization of two lipoproteins in Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - An in vivo expression technology (IVET) system was previously developed and used  to identify Pasteurella multocida genes, which are upregulated during infection of the host. Of the many genes identified, two encoded products which showed similarity to the Haemophilus influenzae lipoproteins, protein D and PCP, which have been shown to stimulate heterologous immunity against infection with H. influenzae. Therefore, the lipoprotein homologues in P. multocida, designated GlpQ and PCP, were investigated. GlpQ and PCP were shown to be lipoproteins by demonstrating that post-translational processing of the proteins was inhibited by globomycin. The P. multocida GlpQ homologue showed glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme activity, indicating that it is a functional homologue of other characterized GlpQ enzymes. Using surface immunoprecipitation, PCP was found to be surface exposed, but GlpQ was not. Non-lipidated forms of GlpQ and PCP were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and used to vaccinate mice. However, mice were not protected from challenge with live P. multocida. The lipoproteins were then expressed in E. coli in the lipidated form and used to vaccinate mice and chickens. Protection against challenge with live P. multocida was not observed.
TI  - Genetic analysis of a plasmid encoding haemocin production in Haemophilus paragallinarum.
AB  - The full sequence of plasmid p250, isolated from Haemophilus paragallinarum strain HP250, has been obtained. The plasmid contains seven ORFs: a putative integrase, a putative replication protein (repB) and five ORFs similar to those from the haemocin (bacteriocin) hmcDCBAI operon from Haemophilus influenzae. Of 19 other non-plasmid-containing H. paragallinarum strains screened (11 serovar reference strains and 8 field isolates), 17 strains produced haemocin and were resistant to killing by strain HP250. These strains, unlike strain HP250, have a chromosomally encoded haemocin operon. A number of other members of the family Pasteurellaceae were tested for haemocin sensitivity. Pasteurella avium, Pasteurella volantium and Pasteurella species A, all non-pathogenic bacteria found in the respiratory tract of chickens suffering from respiratory diseases, were sensitive to H. paragallinarum haemocin. However, amongst the pathogenic Pasteurellaceae, 50 % of P. multocida isolates and all five isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica tested were sensitive to the haemocin. Given the prevalence of haemocin production in H. paragallinarum strains, it may play a role in aiding colonization by inhibiting other Gram-negative bacteria that are associated with the respiratory tract in chickens. The origin of replication from plasmid p250 has been used to generate an Escherichia coli-H. paragallinarum shuttle vector which may be useful in genetically manipulating H. paragallinarum.
TI  - Interference of outer membrane protein PalA with protective immunity against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections in vaccinated pigs.
AB  - The role of antibodies to the outer membrane protein PalA of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in protective immunity was studied in pigs vaccinated with purified PalA alone and PalA in combination with toxoids of the RTX toxins ApxI and ApxII using an established challenge model with the virulent serotype 1 of A. pleuropneumoniae. Pigs that developed antibody titers against PalA after immunization were more significantly affected by challenge with A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1. Following challenge, pigs that were immunized with PalA showed more severe respiratory symptoms, had a higher mortality rate and died faster. They also displayed much more severe lung lesions after necropsy than animals not immunized with PalA. Pigs that were immunized with toxoids of the two cytotoxins ApxI and ApxII were protected against challenge with A. pleuropneumoniae. In contrast, the protective efficacy of the ApxI and ApxII vaccine was completely lost when it was supplemented with PalA. Hence, antibodies induced against the outer membrane protein PalA of A. pleuropneumoniae aggravated the consequences of infection and counteracted the protective effect of anti-ApxI and anti-ApxII antibodies. Due to the high similarity between protein analogues of PalA from various bacteria of the Pasteurellaceae family such as P6 of Haemophilus influenzae or 16kDa Omp of Pasteurella multocida, this deleterious effect of PalA in vaccination should be taken into consideration in the development of vaccines against infections with other Pasteurellaceae.
TI  - Functional characterization of HgbB, a new hemoglobin binding protein of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The biological function and role in pathogenesis of a Pasteurella multocida A:1 strain hemoglobin binding protein was investigated. The hgbB gene from the P. multocida A:1 strain, VP161, was cloned and characterized. hgbB was 2991 bp in length and encoded a mature length protein of 111 kDa. HgbB was predicted to be an outer membrane protein and shared 68 and 69% similarity to the hemoglobin/hemoglobin-haptoglobin binding protein, HI0712 from Haemophilus influenzae Rd and HgpC, from H. influenzae b, respectively. HgbB exhibited features typical of TonB dependent receptors, including seven conserved regions typical of these proteins, and conserved invariant residues. Escherichia coli expressing recombinant HgbB was found to bind hemoglobin in a solid phase dot blot binding assay. However, when a truncated form of the protein was expressed in E. coli, cells could no longer bind hemoglobin. Insertional inactivation of hgbB did not affect the ability of P. multocida to bind hemoglobin, nor its ability to produce disease in a mouse model. In addition, recombinant HgbB did not confer any protection against homologous or heterologous challenge.

TI  - [Purine regulon of gamma-proteobacteria: a detailed description].
AB  - The structure of the purine regulon was studied by a comparative genomic approach in seven genomes of gamma-proteobacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Vibrio cholerae. The palindromic binding site of the purine repressor (consensus ACGCAAACGTTTGCGT) is fairly well retained of genes encoding enzymes that participate in the synthesis of inosinemonophosphate from phosphoribozylpyrophosphate and in transfer of unicarbon groups, and also upstream of some transport protein genes. These genes may be regarded as the main part of the purine regulon. In terms of physiology, the regulation of the purC and gcvTHP/folD genes seems to be especially important, because the PurR site was found upstream of nonorthologous but functionally replaceable genes. However, the PurR site is poorly retained in front of orthologs of some genes belonging to the E. coli purine regulon, such as genes involved in general nitrogen metabolism, biosynthesis of pyrimidines, and synthesis of AMP and GMP from IMP, and also upstream of the purine repressor gene. It is predicted that purine regulons of the examined bacteria include the following genes: upp participating in synthesis of pyrimidines; uraA encoding an uracil transporter gene; serA involved in serine biosynthesis; folD responsible for the conversion of N5,N10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate into N10-formyltetrahydrofolate; rpiA involved in ribose metabolism; and protein genes with an unknown function (yhhQ and ydiK). The PurR site was shown to have different structure in different genomes. Thus, the tendency for a decline of the conservatism of site positions 2 and 15 was observed in genomes of bacteria belonging to the Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae groups.
TI  - Expression of the Pasteurella multocida ompH gene is negatively regulated by the  Fur protein.
AB  - The fur gene of Pasteurella multocida has been cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli fur mutant. The P. multocida fur gene, which encodes a predicted protein of 147 amino acids, displaying the highest identity (89%) with the same protein of Haemophilus influenzae, is negatively regulated by its own product. By construction of a P. multocida fur mutant, it has been demonstrated that the ompH gene, encoding a major structural protein of the outer membrane, presenting high antigenicity power, is negatively regulated by iron and glucose. Furthermore, wild-type and fur-defective cells of P. multocida show the same level of virulence.
TI  - Cloning, overexpression, purification, and immunobiology of an 85-kilodalton outer membrane protein from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We have identified an 85-kDa outer membrane protein that is expressed by all tested strains of Haemophilus ducreyi. Studies of related proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Shigella dysenteriae, suggested a role for these proteins in pathogenesis and immunity. In keeping with the first such described protein from Haemophilus influenzae type B, we termed the H. ducreyi protein D15. The gene encoding the H. ducreyi D15 protein was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be most similar to sequences of the D15-related proteins from other Pasteurella spp. The arrangement of the flanking genes was similar to that of H. influenzae Rd and suggested that D15 was part of a multigene operon. Attempts to make a null mutation of the D15 gene were unsuccessful, paralleling results in other D15 gene studies. Overexpression of H. ducreyi D15 in Escherichia coli resulted in a source of recombinant D15 (rD15) from which it was readily purified. rD15 was immunogenic, and it was found that immunization of rabbits with an rD15 vaccine preparation conferred partial protection against a virulent challenge infection. Antisera to an N-terminal peptide recognized all tested strains of H. ducreyi.
TI  - Virulence of Pasteurella multocida recA mutants.
AB  - In order to determine the role of the RecA protein in the virulence of Pasteurella multocida, a recA mutant was constructed and used in studies of virulence and competition in relation to wild-type strain. To achieve this, firstly, the recA gene was isolated and sequenced, showing an Escherichia coli-like SOS box and encoding a protein of 354 amino acids which has the closest identity with the Haemophilus influenzae RecA protein. Further, the recA mutant was constructed, by inactivating this gene by single recombination of a suicide plasmid containing an internal region of the P. multocida recA gene, and shown to be more sensitive to UV radiation than the parental strain. The P. multocida mutant was slightly attenuated in virulence, as indicated by the LD(50), the time of death of infected animals, and a failure to compete with the wild-type strain in mixed infections. Compared to the parent strain, the mutant had a similar growth rate but a longer lag phase. These data suggest that the diminished virulence of the recA mutant as well as its failure in competition were more a consequence of the long lag phase rather than a direct effect of the inactivation of the recA gene on genes involved in virulence.
TI  - Complete genomic sequence of Pasteurella multocida, Pm70.
AB  - We present here the complete genome sequence of a common avian clone of Pasteurella multocida, Pm70. The genome of Pm70 is a single circular chromosome 2,257,487 base pairs in length and contains 2,014 predicted coding regions, 6 ribosomal RNA operons, and 57 tRNAs. Genome-scale evolutionary analyses based on pairwise comparisons of 1,197 orthologous sequences between P. multocida, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli suggest that P. multocida and H. influenzae diverged approximately 270 million years ago and the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria radiated about 680 million years ago. Two previously undescribed open reading frames, accounting for approximately 1% of the genome, encode large proteins with homology to the virulence-associated filamentous hemagglutinin of Bordetella pertussis. Consistent with the critical role of iron in the survival of many microbial pathogens, in silico and whole-genome microarray analyses identified more than 50 Pm70 genes with a potential role in iron acquisition and metabolism. Overall, the complete genomic sequence and preliminary functional analyses provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host specificity of this important multispecies pathogen.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an in vivo regulated D15/Oma87 homologue in Shigella flexneri using differential display polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Shigella genes expressed during infection likely contribute to adaptation and virulence in the host. Using differential display PCR (DDPCR), a cDNA fragment from Shigella flexneri serotype 5 that showed enhanced expression in a murine model was identified, cloned and sequenced. Enhanced expression was verified by RNA dot blot. The full-length gene was cloned using PCR and sequenced. The complete gene sequence was BLAST searched against GenBank, and exhibited strong homology to genes encoding Haemophilus influenzae D15 and Pasteurella multocida Oma87 protective outer membrane antigens. The S. flexneri gene putatively encodes a approximately 90-kDa protein and was termed oma90. The deduced amino acid sequence from oma90 was analyzed and compared to the D15/Oma87 antigens. Additionally, oma90 mapped to a cluster of orthologous groups, and probably contains an ancient conserved domain. The chromosomal organization of oma90 was similar to that for H. influenzae and P. multocida as well as for other known homologues. Northern blot revealed that the oma90 transcript encoded only oma90. This report represents the first description of a S. flexneri gene identified based on enhanced expression in the host. Furthermore, we report the first evidence demonstrating in vivo regulation of a member of the d15/oma87 gene family.
TI  - Identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from Haemophilus ducreyi which confers NAD independence.
AB  - Members of the family Pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an NAD supplement for growth on laboratory media. In this study, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadV, whose presence allows NAD-independent growth of Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. This gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for NAD independence in Haemophilus ducreyi. When transformed into A. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed NAD-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of NAD on defined media. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 55,619 Da. Compared with the sequence databases, NadV was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor PBEF and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Synechocystis sp., Deinococcus radiodurans, Pasteurella multocida, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. P. multocida and A. actinomycetemcomitans are among the NAD-independent members of the Pasteurellaceae. Homologues of NadV were not found in the sequenced genome of H. influenzae, an NAD-dependent member of the Pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of NAD, such as Escherichia coli. Sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. Identification of a function for this gene in the Pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.
TI  - Analysis of HI0220 protein from Haemophilus influenzae, a novel structural and functional analog of ArcB protein from Escherichia coli.
AB  - A Haemophilus influenzae gene encoding a protein with high homology to ArcB receptor protein from Escherichia coli has been cloned. An error in the previously reported sequence of this gene has been found, thus increasing its open reading frame. The cloned gene comprising the entire open reading frame restores oxygen-dependent regulation of succinate dehydrogenase in an ArcB-deficient E. coli strain. Thus, this gene is a functional analog of ArcB from E. coli. By screening partially sequenced bacterial genomes using the BLAST program, proteins with high homology to ArcB protein from E. coli were found in Salmonella typhi, Yersinia pestis, Vibrio cholerae, and Pasteurella multocida. Comparison of these proteins with ArcB protein from E. coli and H. influenzae revealed conserved amino acid regions. Transmembrane helix II was shown to be highly homologous in all the ArcB-type proteins. The involvement of this region in ArcB-mediated oxygen-dependent regulation is suggested.
TI  - Opsonic potential, protective capacity, and sequence conservation of the Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Tp92.
AB  - By means of a differential screening technique, a 92-kDa antigen, designated Tp92, was identified from Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. This protein is similar in sequence to the protective surface antigens D15 from Haemophilus influenzae and Oma87 from Pasteurella multocida. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence and predicted the outer membrane location for Tp92. In support of this, antiserum raised against recombinant Tp92 promotes opsonization and phagocytosis of T. pallidum by rabbit macrophages, and anti-Tp92 reactivity is absent from washed treponemal preparations presumed to be lacking outer membranes. The Tp92 amino acid sequence is 95.5%-100% conserved among 11 strains representing 4 pathogenic treponemes, and immunization with recombinant Tp92 partially protected rabbits from subsequent T. pallidum challenge. These results demonstrate that Tp92 is an invariant, immunoprotective antigen that may be present on the surface of T. pallidum and may represent a potential vaccine candidate for syphilis.
TI  - Overexpression and immunogenicity of the Oma87 outer membrane protein of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The outer membrane protein of Oma87 from Pasteurella multocida A:1 has significant similarity to the D15 protective antigen of Haemophilus influenzae (Ruffolo and Adler, 1996). Four fragments of Oma87 from a P. multocida serotype D strain were cloned into a pGEX expression vector and transformed into E. coli JM105. Western blot analysis revealed that convalescent chicken sera reacted with only GST-F1 fusion protein which contained amino acids 18 through to 130 of Oma87 fused to the GST protein. Vaccination with the GST-F1 protein failed to protect chickens against challenge with a virulent P. multocida serotype A.
TI  - Pasteurella multocida meningitis in infancy - (a lick may be as bad as a bite).
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is the commonest cause of local infection after an animal bite, but is an unusual cause of meningitis. We report a case of P. multocida meningitis occurring in a 7-week-old infant which was contracted after non-traumatic contact with a household pet, that is, without any animal bite or scratch. The organism may be easily confused with more common Gram-negative pathogens. In this case, it was initially incorrectly diagnosed as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); a possibility which has important implications in the era of routine use of Hib vaccine in infant immunisation programs. CONCLUSION: Pasteurella multocida is an unusual, but serious cause of meningitis in infancy. It is potentially preventable by the avoidance of contact between young infants and the saliva of household pets, in particular by assiduous hand hygiene.
TI  - Candidate vaccine antigens and genes in Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is the causative agent of fowl cholera and other diseases of production animals. Isolates are classified into five groups based on capsular antigens and into 16 serotypes based on LPS antigens. Strains causing fowl cholera are most frequently designated A:1, A:3 or A:4. Whole cell bacterins can provide some degree of protection, but only against the homologous LPS serotype. There is good evidence that cross-protective antigens are expressed only under in vivo conditions. Empirically derived, live, attenuated vaccines can protect against heterologous serotypes, but because the basis for attenuation is undefined, reversion to virulence is not uncommon. Work in our laboratory is aimed at using a variety of approaches to identify potential protective antigens or virulence genes to be used as candidates for attenuating mutations or as the basis for vaccine antigen delivery systems. The gene encoding an outer membrane protein, Oma87, which is a homologue of the D15 protective antigen of Haemophilus influenzae, was cloned and sequenced. Rabbit antiserum prepared against recombinant Oma87 could passively protect mice against infection. Type 4 fimbriae form the basis of vaccines against ovine footrot and bovine keratoconjunctivitis. We have identified type 4 fimbriae on the surface of P. multocida, purified the fimbrial subunit protein, PtfA, and determined its N-terminal amino acid sequence. Subsequent cloning of the ptfA gene and its inactivation will now be used to assess the importance of type 4 fimbriae in virulence. There has long been anecdotal evidence for the importance of capsule in virulence, but unequivocal genetic evidence for such a role is lacking. We have cloned and characterised the capsule biosynthetic locus in P. multocida A:1 and identified four bex genes involved in capsule transport and genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and transfer of the N-acetyl glucosamine and glucuronic acid components of the capsule. It has been suggested that the low concentration of available iron in vivo acts as an environmental cue for expression of cross-protective antigens. Accordingly, we have cloned and characterised the gene encoding transferrin binding protein, Tbpl, so that its role in immunity and virulence can be investigated. Although P. multocida is not normally considered haemolytic, we have observed haemolysis under anaerobic conditions. Standard library construction and screening resulted in the identification of the mesA gene which encodes an esterase enzyme resulting in a haemolytic phenotype under anaerobic conditions. Virulence studies with mesA- mutants were performed to assess its role in pathogenesis. Using a promoterless phoA gene vector system, the cloning of proteins homologous to known surface proteins of other species as well as proteins unique to P. multocida, allowing their potential as vaccine components to be assessed.
TI  - Septic arthritis of the hand and wrist.
AB  - Septic arthritis of the hand and wrist is relatively uncommon. The most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a human or animal bite. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcal species. Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pasteurella multocida, Eikenella corrodens, and Mycobacterium marinum also may occur in specific clinical settings. The best clinical results occur following an accurate diagnosis, prompt surgical drainage, and debridement in concert with appropriate antibiotics and early postoperative range of motion. A delay in diagnosis or treatment is associated with an unsatisfactory outcome.
TI  - Omp85 proteins of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are similar to Haemophilus influenzae D-15-Ag and Pasteurella multocida Oma87.
AB  - The genes encoding homologous 85 kDa outer membrane proteins of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis have been cloned and sequenced. The gonococcal gene, omp85, was identified by screening a genomic library with an antiserum raised against purified gonococcal outer membranes. The gene encoded a 792 amino acid protein, Omp85, having a typical signal peptide and a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine characteristic of outer membrane proteins. The amino acid sequence was similar to that of the D15 protective surface antigen (D-15-Ag) of Haemophilus influenzae, and the Oma87 of Pasteurella multocida. Southern analysis demonstrated that omp85 was present as a single copy in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. PCR amplification was used to obtain a clone of the N. meningitidis omp85 homologue. Sequence analysis revealed that the N. meningitidis Omp85 was 95% identical to the N. gonorrhoeae Omp85.
TI  - Importance of the galE gene on the virulence of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The galE gene of Pasteurella multocida has been isolated by complementing galE-defective mutants of Salmonella typhimurium with a plasmid library of this organism. The complete nucleotide sequence of the P. multocida galE gene consists of 1017 nucleotides, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 339 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence displayed the highest identity (85%) to the GalE protein of Haemophilus influenzae. However, the gene organization surrounding the galE locus was different from that of H. influenzae. A galE-defective mutant of P. multocida was obtained by replacement of the active galE gene by a copy inactivated in vitro. The resulting galE mutant was highly attenuated as seen in a biological test carried out in a mouse model.
TI  - Neuraminidase (sialidase) activity of Haemophilus parasuis.
AB  - Neuraminidase (sialidase), a potential virulence factor in bacteria, was demonstrated in Haemophilus parasuis, an invasive swine pathogen, but not in four other pathogens of the Pasteurellaceae family: H. influenzae, H. somnus, H. paragallinarum, or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. H. parasuis neuraminidase had an acidic pH optimum and a specificity for several substrates also cleaved by other bacterial neuraminidases. Similar to the neuraminidase of Pasteurella multocida, H. parasuis neuraminidase was cell associated and did not require divalent cations for activity. Exogenous sialic acid added to growth medium of H. parasuis was cleared after a lag of about 10 h and these cultures grew to a greater final density than cultures without added sialic acid, indicating that exogenous sialic acid is metabolized. The role of sialidase in providing nutrients to H. parasuis may be an important factor in its obligate parasitism.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - Bacterial ghosts as multifunctional vaccine particles.
AB  - Expression of cloned PhiX174 gene E in Gram-negative bacteria results in lysis of the bacteria by formation of an E-specific transmembrane tunnel structure built through the cell envelope complex. Bacterial ghosts have been produced from a variety of bacteria including Escherichia coli. Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Vibrio cholerae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Helicobacter pylori. Such ghosts are used as non-living candidate vaccines and represent an alternative to heat or chemically inactivated bacteria. In recombinant ghosts, foreign proteins can be inserted into the inner membrane prior to E-mediated lysis via specific N-, or C-, or N- and C-terminal anchor sequences. The export of proteins into the periplasmic space or the expression of recombinant S-layer proteins vastly extents the capacity of ghosts or recombinant ghosts as carriers of foreign epitopes or proteins. Oral, aerogenic or parenteral applications of (recombinant) ghosts in experimental animals induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses against bacterial and target components including protective mucosal immunity. The most relevant advantage of ghosts and recombinant bacterial ghosts as immunogens is that no inactivation procedures that denature relevant immunogenic determinants are employed in the production of ghosts used as vaccines or as carriers of relevant antigens. The inserted target antigens into the inner membrane or into S-layer proteins are not limited in size.
TI  - Occurrence of [copper, zinc]-cofactored superoxide dismutase in Pasteurella haemolytica and its serotype distribution.
AB  - Fifty-two ovine strains of Pasteurella haemolytica and P. trehalosi representing  serotypes 1-16 were examined for the presence of [copper, zinc]superoxide dismutase DNA sequences. This was done using a combination of polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers based on the sequence of the [Cu,Zn]superoxide dismutase gene (sodC) in related species and Southern hybridization using a fragment of sodC from P. haemolytica A2 serotype as a probe. Both detection methods identified a fragment of the sodC gene in 9/9 strains of P. haemolytica serotype 2 examined and in 5/8 strains of serotype 7. No evidence of this gene was found in any other serotype of P. haemolytica or in any P. trehalosi serotype. Comparison of DNA sequence showed near identity between sodC from the A2 and A7 serotypes of P. haemolytica and substantial similarity (70%) to sodC previously sequenced in P. multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae. Analysis by gel electrophoresis of the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell lysates showed that one or more superoxide dismutase is present in all serotypes. However, cyanide-inhibitable activity, corresponding to [Cu,Zn]superoxide dismutase, was detected only in those strains of serotypes A2 and A7 which showed evidence of the sodC gene fragment.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, expression, and protective capacity of the oma87 gene encoding the Pasteurella multocida 87-kilodalton outer membrane antigen.
AB  - Membrane proteins of Pasteurella multocida have been shown previously to elicit protective immunity. We have identified an 87-kDa outer membrane antigen, Oma87, which is present in all 16 serotypes of P. multocida. The gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced and found to have significant similarity to the D15 protective surface antigen of Haemophilus influenzae. Oma87 was localized to the outer membrane of the cell, and proteinase K treatment suggested that the protein is surface exposed. Native and recombinant Oma87 were strongly immunostained by convalescent-phase antiserum, indicating that the protein is expressed in vivo. Specific Oma87 antiserum protected mice against homologous, lethal P. multocida challenge. These results suggest that Oma87 is a protective outer membrane antigen of P. multocida.
TI  - Pasteurella multocida produces a protein with homology to the P6 outer membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - An antibody specific for a 16-kDa outer membrane protein of a rabbit strain of Pasteurella multocida was used to probe representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes of P. multocida, as well as the vaccine strains CU and M9, and all were shown to express the protein. The gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced and found to have extensive sequence homology with the gene encoding the P6 protein of Haemophilus influenzae. The protein in P. multocida has been designated P6-like. The gene encoding the P6-like protein was used to probe members of the family Pasteurellaceae and other gram-negative bacteria. Representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes (as well as the vaccine strains CU and M9) of P. multocida hybridized with the P6-like gene under conditions of high stringency. The DNA from H. influenzae hybridized weakly with the P6-like gene under these conditions, but Pasteurella haemolytica (representatives of A and T biotypes), Bordetella bronchiseptica, B. avium, Actinobacillus suis, A. suis-like, A. lignieresii, A. ureae, A. rossii, A. pleuropneumoniae, A. equuli, and various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium) did not hybridize detectably. Under conditions of lower stringency, the P6-like gene also hybridized strongly with DNA from P. multocida, H. influenzae, and A. rossii but weakly with DNA from P. haemolytica and members of the genus Actinobacillus. These results suggest that the P6-like protein of P. multocida might be useful as an immunizing product to protect poultry from avian cholera. This suggestion stems from (i) our finding that the P6-like protein in P. multocida is widely distributed among all the somatic serotypes and (ii) the previous work of others demonstrating that the P6 protein of H. influenzae elicits a protective immune response in animal models of human disease.
TI  - [Macrolides. New therapeutic prospects].
AB  - The aim of the development of semisynthetic derivatives was to overcome the problem of chemical stability of erythromycin A in acid medium, with less variability in gastro-intestinal absorption and leading to renewed interest in macrolides. The new macrolides have the same antibacterial spectrum as erythromycin A including Gram-positive and Gram-negative cocci, intracellular bacteria, mycoplasma, Campylobacter sp., Helicobacter pylori, mycobacteria spp., Gram-negative bacilli including Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Pasteurella multocida, Gram-positive bacilli including Corynebacterium diphtheriae and anaerobic species. In vitro activity against Haemophilus influenzae is still a controversial subject. Macrolides are among the best tolerated antibacterial agents. Theoretically, macrolides could be given to a large range of patients even those suffering from underlying diseases. The new macrolides, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, rokitamycin and miokamycin, are indicated for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections due to intracellular bacteria or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Macrolides could be used as first line therapy for non-gonococcal urethritis, especially those due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum. In pelvic inflammatory infections in which Chlamydia trachomatis is involved macrolides could also be used. Other non-conventional indications under discussion are H. pylori and Lyme's disease. Macrolides in combination with other antibacterials could be an alternative for Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. The antiparasite effect of erythromycin has been known since the 1950s. Extensive experimental work is currently underway to determine the potential use of these drugs in this setting. Research during the 80s in the macrolide field, led to enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. Current research is focused on expanding the antibacterial spectrum and to overcome cross-resistance among 14-membered-ring macrolides.
TI  - Electron microscopy of phages in serotypes of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinobacillus ureae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of bacteriophages. Phages were detected in serotype a (SUNY 75) and e (UOH 1705) and in the fresh clinical isolates UOH Q1243 and UOH Q1247 of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Phages were not found in serotype b, c and d strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, in the fresh clinical isolate UOH Q1244 of this species or in old strains (including reference strains) of related species from the Actinobacillus-Haemophilus-Pasteurella group.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae adenylate cyclase gene: cloning, sequence, and essential role in competence.
AB  - Competence for transformation in Haemophilus influenzae is stimulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and requires the cAMP-dependent catabolite regulatory protein CRP. Thus, understanding the control of competence will require understanding how cAMP levels are regulated. As a first step, we have cloned the H. influenzae adenylate cyclase gene (cya) by complementing the Lac- phenotype of delta cya Escherichia coli. Its sequence specifies an 843-amino-acid protein which has significant identity to other known bacterial adenylate cyclases (41 to 43% and 61% identical to the cya genes of enteric bacteria and of Pasteurella multocida, respectively). As seen in other bacterial cya genes, there is evidence for regulation similar to that demonstrated for E. coli: the presence of a strong consensus CRP binding site within the promoter of the gene may provide feedback control of cAMP levels by repressing cya transcription, and translation may be limited by the weak ribosome binding site and by initiation of protein synthesis with GUG rather than AUG or the UUG used in other bacterial cya genes. We confirmed the essential role of cAMP in competence by constructing and characterizing H. influenzae cya mutants. This strain failed to develop competence either spontaneously or after transfer to a competence-inducing medium. However, it became as competent as its wild-type parent in the presence of exogenous cAMP. This result suggests that the failure of exogenously added cAMP to induce optimum competence in wild-type cells is not due to a limitation to the entry of cAMP into the cells. Rather, it strongly favors models in which competence induction requires both an increase in intracellular cAMP and a second as yet unidentified regulatory event. H. influenzae strains mutant in cya or crp were unable to ferment xylose or ribose. This confirms that influenzae, like E. coli, uses cAMP and CRP to regulate nutrient uptake and utilization and lends increasing support to the hypothesis that DNA uptake is mechanism of nutrient acquisition.
TI  - Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin: use of frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance.
AB  - MICs of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. Frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. Clarithromycin was the most active drug against Bacteroides spp. but the least active against Haemophilus influenzae. Azithromycin was most active against H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pasteurella multocida, and Fusobacterium spp. but the least active against Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. All three drugs had equivalent activities against Staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. None of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae (particularly Escherichia coli and Citrobacter diversus) and Acinetobacter baumannii. Although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. Cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for Fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.
TI  - Ecology and significance of Pasteurellaceae in man--an update.
AB  - Within the last decade new knowledge has emerged concerning the significance of Pasteurellaceae in man; the classification has undergone some changes, and new taxa were described. Haemophilus influenzae serotype b was shown to have a clonal distribution that is related to demographic patterns of the human host. Brazilian purpuric fever is caused by a special clone of Haemophilus aegyptius. H. influenzae biotype IV seems to be a genital pathogen, and may deserve species rank. New Pasteurella species have been described, that occur in well known pathological foci in man, e.g. bite wounds. Toxigenic P. multocida may occur in man also; the significance of toxigenicity in man is not known. The real actinobacilli of man, A. ureae and A. hominis are still very rarely reported. In order to avoid wrong epidemiological conclusions, correct diagnosis is emphasized.
TI  - Multivariate chemosystematics demonstrate two groups of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains.
AB  - Chemical analysis by us has indicated that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is not a homogeneous species. The present study used chemometric methods and a multitude of chemical characters to examine this further. Strains were characterized by cell sugar and fatty acid contents, lysis kinetics during EDTA and EDTA plus lysozyme exposure, methylene blue reduction, and API ZYM enzymatic assessment of whole cells and outer membrane vesicles/fragments. In total, 41 quantitative variables were analyzed from each of 9 strains and treated with principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy. These methods divided A. actinomycetemcomitans into 2 strain groups. One group contained ATCC 33384, ATCC 29522, FDC 2112 and FDC 2043; the other comprised ATCC 29524, ATCC 29523, FDC 2097, FDC 511 and FDC Y4. With an F-test, the groups (classes) of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains could be distinguished at 95% confidence limits. Both groups were distinct from members of the genera Haemophilus and Pasteurella (Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica).
TI  - Purification and characterization of protein H, the major porin of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Protein H (B. Lugtenberg, R. van Boxtel, D. Evenberg, M. de Jong, P. Storm, and J. Frik, Infect. Immun. 52:175-182, 1986) is the major polypeptide of the outer membrane of Pasteurella multocida, a bacterium pathogenic for humans and animals. We have purified this protein to homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography after selective extraction with surfactants and demonstrated its pore-forming ability after reincorporation into planar lipid bilayers. In these experiments, the current through the pores was a linear function of the applied voltage in the range of -50 to +50 mV. Voltages beyond +/- 50 mV tended to partially close the channels, giving rise to apparent negative resistances. These observations suggest that protein H channels are probably not voltage regulated in vivo. With the patch clamp technique, single-channel conductance fluctuations of 0.33 nS were recorded in 1 M KCl. Electrophoretic and circular dichroism analyses showed that protein H forms homotrimers stable in sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature, with a high content of beta-sheet secondary structure. Upon boiling, the trimers were fully dissociated into monomers with an increase of alpha helix and irregular structure, at the expense of beta sheets. The apparent molecular mass of fully denatured monomers ranged between 37 and 41.8 kDa, depending on the electrophoretic system used for analysis. The trimeric arrangement of protein H was confirmed by image analysis of negatively stained, two-dimensional crystal arrays. This morphological study revealed, in agreement with electrophoretical data, a trimeric structure with an overall diameter of 7.7 nm. Each monomer appeared to contain a pore with an average diameter of 1 nm. Quantitative comparisons revealed that the amino acid composition (hydropathy index of -0.40) and the N-terminal sequence (determined over 36 residues) of protein H are similar to those of bacterial general porins, notably porin P2 of Haemophilus influenzae. We conclude from this set of structural and functional data that protein H of P. multocida is a pore-forming protein related to the superfamily of the nonspecific bacterial porins.
TI  - Phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family Pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16S rRNA sequences.
AB  - Virtually complete 16S rRNA sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family Pasteurellaceae. Of these strains, 15 were Pasteurella, 16 were Actinobacillus, and 23 were Haemophilus. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the Neighbor-Joining method. Fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. The first cluster included the type strains of Haemophilus influenzae, H. aegyptius, H. aphrophilus, H. haemolyticus, H. paraphrophilus, H. segnis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. This cluster also contained A. actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4, ATCC 29522, ATCC 29523, and ATCC 29524 and H. aphrophilus NCTC 7901. The second cluster included the type strains of A. seminis and Pasteurella aerogenes and H. somnus OVCG 43826. The third cluster was composed of the type strains of Pasteurella multocida, P. anatis, P. avium, P. canis, P. dagmatis, P. gallinarum, P. langaa, P. stomatis, P. volantium, H. haemoglobinophilus, H. parasuis, H. paracuniculus, H. paragallinarum, and A. capsulatus. This cluster also contained Pasteurella species A CCUG 18782, Pasteurella species B CCUG 19974, Haemophilus taxon C CAPM 5111, H. parasuis type 5 Nagasaki, P. volantium (H. parainfluenzae) NCTC 4101, and P. trehalosi NCTC 10624. The fourth cluster included the type strains of Actinobacillus lignieresii, A. equuli, A. pleuropneumoniae, A. suis, A. ureae, H. parahaemolyticus, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrohaemolyticus, H. ducreyi, and P. haemolytica. This cluster also contained Actinobacillus species strain CCUG 19799 (Bisgaard taxon 11), A. suis ATCC 15557, H. ducreyi ATCC 27722 and HD 35000, Haemophilus minor group strain 202, and H. parainfluenzae ATCC 29242. The type strain of P. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group. The branching of the Pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. The four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. The clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16S rRNA sequence relative to outgroup organisms). While the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. We do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.
TI  - Application of multivariate analyses of enzymic data to classification of members of the Actinobacillus-Haemophilus-Pasteurella group.
AB  - Outer membrane vesicles and fragments from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  Actinobacillus lignieresii, Actinobacillus ureae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida were isolated and examined semiquantitatively for 19 enzyme activities by using the API ZYM micromethod. The enzyme contents of vesicles and fragments were compared with the enzyme contents of whole cells of the same organisms. Enzymic data were analyzed by using principal-component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy. This technique allowed us to distinguish among the closely related organisms A. actinomycetemcomitans, H. aphrophilus, and H. paraphrophilus. A. actinomycetemcomitans was divided into two groups of strains. A. lignieresii fell outside or on the border of the A. actinobacillus class. A. ureae, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, P. haemolytica, and P. multocida fell outside the A. actinomycetemcomitans, H. aphrophilus, and H. paraphrophilus classes.
TI  - [Purification, amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence of the major protein (protein H) of the outer membrane of Pasteurella multocida].
AB  - The major protein (protein H) of the outer membrane of Pasteurella multocida was  purified by size-exclusion chromatography after selective extraction with detergents. The protein forms homotrimers which are stable in the presence of SDS at room temperature. Upon treatment at 100 degrees C, the protein is fully dissociated by the detergent into monomers exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa as estimated by electrophoresis. The amino acid composition of protein H is characterized by a low hydropathy index (HI = -0.40) and is strongly related to the compositions of bacterial porins, notably porins P2 (Haemophilus influenzae), PIA (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and Cl.2 ("class 2 porin" of N. meningitidis). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of protein H shares a strong homology with those of porins OmpC (Escherichia coli) and P2. These data indicate that protein H of P. multocida is a porin belonging to the superfamily of the non-specific porins of Gram-negative eubacteria outer membrane.
TI  - Molecular distribution of ROB-1 beta-lactamase in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - The plasmid content and molecular distribution of the ROB-1 beta-lactamase was investigated in 31 swine isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Three types of plasmid patterns were observed in ampicillin-resistant isolates: a predominant one consisting of 2.6-, 2.9-, and 5.0-kb plasmids and two other patterns consisting of 4.2- and 5.5-kb plasmids and of a 6.8-kb plasmid. Plasmid DNA preparations were hybridized with a blaROB-1 intragenic fragment from the Haemophilus influenzae Rrob plasmid. Positive hybridizations were observed with all ampicillin-resistant isolates. The blaROB-1 gene was found on 3 plasmids of 2.6, 5.5, and 6.8 kb. One swine isolate of Pasteurella multocida also had a 2.6-kb plasmid bearing blaROB-1. ROB-1 was confirmed in typical isolates by isoelectric focusing and blaROB-1 sequences were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification with an intragenic set of primers. Plasmids bearing blaROB-1 were successfully electro-transformed in a susceptible A. pleuropneumoniae isolate. These results emphasize the importance of ROB-1 in A. pleuropneumoniae and identify a possible reservoir of beta-lactam resistance.
TI  - Comparison and analysis of the nucleotide sequences of pilin genes from Haemophilus influenzae type b strains Eagan and M43.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated antigenic differences among the pili expressed by various strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). In order to understand the molecular basis for these differences, the structural gene for pilin was cloned from Hib strain Eagan (p+) and the nucleotide sequence was compared to those of strains M43 (p+) and 770235 b0f+, which had been previously determined. The pilin gene of Hib strain Eagan (p+) had a 648-bp open reading frame that encoded a 20-amino-acid leader sequence followed by the 196 amino acids found in mature pilin. The translated sequence was three amino acids larger than pilins of strains M43 (p+) and 770235 b0f+ and was 78% identical and 95% homologous when conservative amino acid substitutions were considered. Differences between the amino acid sequences were not localized to any one region but rather were distributed throughout the proteins. Comparison of protein hydrophilicity profiles showed several hydrophilic regions with sequences that were conserved between strain Eagan (p+) and pilins of other Hib strains, and these regions represent potentially conserved antigenic domains. Southern blot analyses using an intragenic probe from the pilin gene of strain Eagan (p+) showed that the pilin gene was conserved among all type b and nontypeable strains of H. influenzae examined, and only a single copy was present in these strains. Homologous genes were not present in the phylogenetically related species Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. These data indicate that the pilin gene was highly conserved among different strains of H. influenzae and that small differences in the pilin amino acid sequences account for the observed antigenic differences of assembled pili from these strains.
TI  - The development of macrolides: clarithromycin in perspective.
AB  - Macrolide antibiotics have been available and used clinically since 1952. The class of drugs originated from a soil sample obtained from the City of Ilo-Ilo on the Island of Paray in the Philippines. Erythromycin has been the most widely used agent of this class called 'macrolides' because they possess the macrocyclic lactone nucleus. Many esters of erythromycin are well established as agents to treat a variety of respiratory and cutaneous infections, particularly in children. There has been a resurgence of interest in macrolides as a result of the recognition of pathogens such as Legionella, Chlamydia and Campylobacter spp. A number of new 14-membered macrolides have been synthesised in recent years with the goal of overcoming some of the problems of the older erythromycin agents. There has been variable activity of erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae; there has been gastrointestinal irritation, particularly in adults; and the older agents are administered four times a day. Clarithromycin has increased activity against Legionella, and Branhamella spp., and Pasteurella multocida, and, with its 14-OH metabolite, inhibits Haemophilus spp. It is also more active against chlamydia and against anaerobic species while retaining excellent activity against streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae. It has increased plasma peak levels and a sufficiently long half-life for twice daily administration. Furthermore, it is well tolerated. Thus clarithromycin offers potential for use in those areas in which a safe, well tolerated macrolide will be used, namely respiratory, skin structure and selected diarrhoeal and genital infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY v 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY v 3522 was compared with the activities of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. MICs (in micrograms/ml) of BAY v 3522 were as follows: Staphylococcus spp. (except for oxacillin-resistant strains), 0.13 to 1; Streptococcus spp. (except for some viridans group streptococci), less than or equal to 0.015 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 to 8; other enterococci, 0.5 to greater than 32; beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, 0.13 to 1; beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, 0.5 to 4; Pasteurella multocida, 0.06 to 0.25; and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5 to greater than 32. Among the cephalosporins, BAY v 3522 was the most active against gram-positive cocci and cefixime was the most active against gram-negative bacilli; BAY v 3522 was similar in activity to amoxicillin-clavulanate against most species.
TI  - Multivariate analysis of quantitative chemical and enzymic characterization data  in classification of Actinobacillus, Haemophilus and Pasteurella spp.
AB  - Chemotaxonomic data for strains of Actinobacillus, Haemophilus and Pasteurella spp. were analysed using three multivariate statistical strategies: principal components, partial least squares discriminant, and soft independent modelling of class analogy. The species comprised Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Haemophilus aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, H. influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, P. haemolytica and P. ureae. Strains were characterized by cell sugar and fatty acid composition, lysis kinetics during EDTA and EDTA plus lysozyme treatment, and methylene blue reduction. In total 23 quantitative variables were compiled from chemotaxonomic analyses of 25 strains. A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. aphrophilus formed distinct classes which differed from those of H. paraphrophilus, H. influenzae and Pasteurella spp. All characterization variables, except those describing fatty acid content, contributed significantly to inter-species discrimination.
TI  - [Meningoencephalitis due to Pasteurella multocida: clinico-laboratory study of a  case in an infant].
AB  - The authors report a case of Pasteurella multocida meningoencephalitis in a 5 week-old female infant, with special attention to clinical, laboratory and evolutive features. A moderate neurological sequel was observed at follow-up examinations. A brief review of the importance of P. multocida in human pathology is presented on the basis of the international literature, since the authors did not find any Brazilian reports. The most important feature on P. multocida is the prevalence of bacterial meningitis at the extremes of age. Otherwise, significant mistaken was found between Gram stained smears of body fluids for P. multocida and Haemophilus influenzae or Neisseria meningitidis. Because its role in infections following animal bite or scratch and its opportunistic feature, P. multocida must be included among the possible etiologic agent of bacteremia or sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis or immunosuppression.
TI  - [The fatty acid composition of Haemophilus and Pasteurella multocida cells as a phylogenetic marker].
AB  - When grown on meat-peptone agar with heated blood, different Haemophilus species  (H. influenzae, H. parahaemolyticus, H. parasuis, H. pleuropneumoniae), including different H. influenzae serovars (a, b, c, d, e, f), and Pasteurella multocida have identical fatty acid composition, characterized by the prevalence of fatty acids with 16 carbon atoms, constituting about 70% and more of the total number of fatty acids, and a low level of fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms. P. multocida strains cultivated on meat-peptone agar with unheated blood have a greatly increased content of fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms, while the content of fatty acids with 16 carbon atoms is much lower. The identity of fatty acid composition under similar cultivation conditions, together with their similarity in other phenetic signs, is indicative of close phylogenic relationship between bacteria belonging to the genus Haemophilus and P. multocida.
TI  - Genetic determinant of the ROB-1 beta-lactamase in bovine and porcine Pasteurella strains.
AB  - The ROB-1 beta-lactamase, previously described in Haemophilus influenzae, has been found in the genus Pasteurella. In three bovine strains of Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica, ROB-1 production was determined by plasmids of 4.4 kilobases. In one porcine strain of Pasteurella aerogenes, the enzyme seems to be chromosomally encoded.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups A and B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. Azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 1 microgram/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It inhibited Campylobacter spp. and Pasteurella multocida, and had an MIC50 of 8 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.
TI  - DNA probe technology for detection of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A 5 kb Haemophilus influenzae DNA fragment involved in penicillin-binding proteins expression was used as a probe for specific detection of H. influenzae strains. The 32p-labeled probe specificity was assessed by hybridization to bacterial dots and 75 strains were tested. All H. influenzae (18) and H. aegyptius (1) strains reacted very strongly with the probe. The H. influenzae serotypes tested (a, b, and non-typable strains) did not differ in their hybridization. Some hybridization was also found with the 12 other Haemophilus species tested as well as other Pasteurellaceae such as Actinobacillus lignieresii and Pasteurella multocida. Two other less related species (Klebsiella ozaenae and Providencia stuartii) also showed low hybridization. The probe detected as low as 10(5)-10(6) H. influenzae cells and 0.1 microgram of DNA in a dot sensitivity test. Hybridization to electroblotted, digested DNA from different species which reacted in the bacterial dot test revealed strong hybridization to H. influenzae and H. aegyptius only. This DNA probe should prove useful for H. influenzae and possibly H. aegyptius detection due to its high specificity and sensitivity under stringent hybridization conditions.
TI  - Chemotaxonomy of selected species of the Actinobacillus-Haemophilus-Pasteurella group by means of gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and bioenzymatic methods.
AB  - Instrumental analytical and bioenzymatic methods were used to differentiate between species of the Actinobacillus-Haemophilus-Pasteurella group. Long-chain fatty acids were analysed directly with gas chromatography (GC) without derivatization. GC of trifluoroacetylated whole-cell methanolysates was a rapid method for differentiation. Cellular sugars were more suitable for differentiation than fatty acids. D-Glycero-D-mannoheptose, the major localization of which was lipopolysaccharide, distinguished H. aphrophilus from A. actinomycetemcomitans, H. paraphrophilus, H. influenzae type b, P. haemolytica, P. multocida, and P. ureae. GC of single colonies, which is a new chemotaxonomic method, was preferable to GC of liquid-grown cells. Lysozyme-and EDTA-induced bacteriolysis and reduction of methylene blue by cellular hydrogenase served as additional criteria for differentiation.
TI  - [Respiratory tract infections--clinical results with ofloxacin].
AB  - In an open clinical trial, out-patients with respiratory tract infections were given 200 mg ofloxacin b. i. d. orally. 36 had acute bronchitis and pneumonia was diagnosed in 44. The average duration of therapy was nine days for bronchitis and 12 days for pneumonia. In the sputum of bronchitis patients, Haemophilus influenzae (n = 25), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 18), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2) and Pasteurella multocida (n = 1) were isolated. 17 H. influenzae and 12 S. pneumoniae were eliminated. All 20 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from patients with pneumonia were eliminated. A cure or improvement of clinical symptoms was seen in 32 of 36 cases of bronchitis and in 33 of 44 cases of pneumonia treated with ofloxacin.
TI  - Differentiation among closely related organisms of the Actinobacillus-Haemophilus-Pasteurella group by means of lysozyme and EDTA.
AB  - Bacteriolysis in Tris-maleate buffer (0.005 M, pH 7.2) supplemented with EDTA (0.01 M) and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL, 1.0 microgram/ml) was set up to assist differentiation between the taxonomically closely related Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus. A. actinomycetemcomitans was more sensitive to lysis in this system than H. aphrophilus. The standard method for bacteriolysis separated the 10 tested strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans into two groups (I and II) based on their lysis patterns, whereas the 7 strains of H. aphrophilus examined were homogeneous. In group I of A. actinomycetemcomitans, EDTA displayed a considerable lytic effect, which was not increased by supplementation with HEWL. In group II, the lytic effect of EDTA was much less, but HEWL had a considerable supplementary lytic effect. When the turbidity of A. actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 29522) or H. aphrophilus (ATCC 33389) suspended in Tris buffer was monitored at close pH intervals (0.2) from pH 5.2 to 9.2, maximal lysis of ATCC 29522 occurred with EDTA at pH 8.0 and with EDTA-HEWL at pH 7.6, while ATCC 33389 lysed with EDTA at pH 9.0 and with EDTA-HEWL at pH 9.2. When other members of the family Pasteurellaceae (Haemophilus influenzae type b, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Pasteurella ureae) were included for comparison, the group I strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans were the most rapidly lysed by EDTA. H. paraphrophilus was the least sensitive of the gram-negative strains tested, but not as resistant as Micrococcus luteus (control). M. luteus was the organism most sensitive to lysozyme, followed by P. ureae and the group II strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, while the group I strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, H. paraphrophilus, and P. haemolytica were the least sensitive organisms.
TI  - Differentiation between major species of the Actinobacillus--Haemophilus--Pasteurella group by gas chromatography of trifluoroacetic acid anhydride derivatives from whole-cell methanolysates.
AB  - A method based on whole-cell methanolysis and trifluoroacetic acid anhydride derivatization was developed for routine laboratory differentiation between isolates from the Actinobacillus--Haemophilus--Pasteurella group. All species, except Haemophilus aphrophilus, contained D-glycero-D-mannoheptose, although in varying concentrations. The distribution of this sugar could be used to distinguish H. aphrophilus from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, H. paraphrophilus, H. influenzae type b, Pasteurella haemolytica, P. multocida and P. ureae, and also H. influenzae type b from Pasteurellae. The pattern of major sugars in P. ureae and P. haemolytica resembled that of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Major fatty acids of the whole-cell methanolysates provided no basis of interspecies differentiation.
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - The microbial evaluation of acute cellulitis.
AB  - Twenty consecutive patients with acute cellulitis were studied by retrospective chart review. Patients with suffusion and edema, with or without vesicles, were included. Patients with breaks in the skin, with focal suppurations or with concurrent antimicrobial therapy were excluded. In nineteen of the twenty patients, aspirates (95 percent) failed to grow organisms. Pasteurella multocida was grown from subcutaneous aspirate and blood cultures of a single patient; he was immunocompromised by Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and chlorambucil therapy. Two of the nineteen patients with negative aspirate cultures had positive blood cultures, one for type B Hemophilus influenzae and the other for a probably spurious Campylobacter fetus. All twenty patients, including the two immunocompromised patients, responded completely to appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. There were no complications of the needle aspirate technique observed. Needle aspiration is indicated early in the course of acute cellulitis in the immunocompromised, the young child with facial cellulitis, those with open wounds, and those who fail to respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy. For the otherwise well patient with intact host defenses, it is of extremely low sensitivity.
TI  - Pasteurella multocida meningitis.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida appears to be a very rare cause of meningitis. The bacterium has morphological similarities with other causative organisms, particularly Haemophilus influenzae, and its apparent rarity may be due partly to misidentification. This case, only the fourth reported from the United Kingdom, could not be distinuished clinically from the meningitis, owing to other pyogenic bacteria.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition of Haemophilus species, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus Actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  - The fatty acid composition of 35 Haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-OH-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. The three C18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. This general pattern was also found for most of the other species of Haemophilus examined (H. aegyptius, H. aphrophilus, H. canis, H. gallinarum, H. haemolyticus, and H. parainfluenzae). Small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for H. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species H. paraphrohaemolyticus, H. paraphrophilus and H. suis. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from H. influenzae. Pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely related to that of Haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the C18 fatty acids. The fatty acid pattern of H. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. This species lacked 3-OH-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.
TI  - [Nitrofurantoin-test for the differentiation of bordetella bronchiseptica (author's transl)].
AB  - Bordetella bronchiseptica is primarily resistant against nitrofurantoin (MIC greater than 200 mug/ml), and this feature can be used for the differentiation of the organism from other gram-negative coccobacteria. Nitrofurantoin paper disks (300 mug) failed to affect the growth of 150 strains of B. bronchiseptica isolated from different animal hosts, but they produced marked inhibition zones in the cultures of the followingspecies: Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Pasteurella haemolytica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Francisella tularensis, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis and Brucella neotomae.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens in monkeys.
AB  - Respiratory disease in a dynamic colony of nonhuman primates during a 4-year period was due primarily to infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus influenzae. The principal secondary invaders were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci. A high fatality rate was associated with infections caused by each of the primary pathogens, and females appeared to be more susceptible than males. Incidence of respiratory disease was greatest in the fall and early winter; however, at all times newly colonized monkeys had a higher infection rate than conditioned monkeys. Infections were occasionally confined only to the lungs and were sometimes present without grossly observable lung lesions. The information given on susceptibility of 10 species of nonhuman primates to respiratory infections provides a basis for developing disease models.
