TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. method: thirty ibd patients [15 with crohn's disease (cd) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (uc)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. all patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. from every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees  c until analysis using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. results: multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for bacteroides ureolyticus, campylobacter gracilis, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and treponema denticola (p<0.001). cd  patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than uc patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (p<0.05). cd patients harbored higher levels of p. melaninogenica, s. aureus, s. anginosus, and s. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (p<0.05). uc patients harbored higher levels of s. aureus (p=0.01) and p. anaerobius (p=0.05)  than controls only in gingivitis sites. conclusion: our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, ibd patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival  sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  == experimental alveolitis in rats: microbiological, acute phase response and histometric characterization of delayed alveolar healing.
AB  == the pathogenesis of alveolitis is not well known and therefore experimental situations that mimic some features of this disease should be developed. objective: in this study, the evolution of the experimentally induced infection in rat sockets is characterized, which leads to clinical signs of suppurative alveolitis with remarkable wound healing disturbs. material and methods: non-infected (group i) and experimentally infected sockets in rattus novergicus (group ii) were histometrically evaluated regarding the kinetics of alveolar healing. in addition, the characterization of the present bacteria in inoculation material and the serum levels of c-reactive protein (crp) were performed. the detected species were capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum ss nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus anginosus, treponema socranskii and streptococcus sanguis. results: all experimentally infected rats developed suppurative alveolitis, showing higher levels of crp in comparison to those non-infected ones. furthermore, infected rats presented a significant delayed wound healing as measured by the histometric analysis (higher persistent  polymorphonuclear infiltrate and lower density of newly formed bone). conclusion: these findings indicate that rat sockets with experimentally induced infection produced higher levels of serum crp, showing the potential of disseminated infection and a disturb in the alveolar repair process in an interesting experimental model for alveolitis studies.

TI  == the role of bacteria in oral cancer.
AB  == despite the widening interest in the possible association between bacteria and different stages of cancer development, our knowledge in its relation to oral cancers remains inadequate. the aim of this review article is to derive a better  understanding on the role of various micro-organisms in the etiogenesis of oral cancers through all the available data on the pubmed. different bacteria have been proposed to induce carcinogenesis either through induction of chronic inflammation or by interference, either directly or indirectly, with eukaryotic cell cycle and signaling pathways, or by metabolism of potentially carcinogenic substances like acetaldehyde causing mutagenesis. studies have shown diversity of isolated bacterial taxa between the oral cancer tissue specimens and the control, with exiguobacterium oxidotolerans, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula being specific for tumorogenic tissues. most isolates are saccharolytic and acid tolerant. streptococcus anginosus, commonly linked with esophageal and pharyngeal cancers, is not of significance in oral cancers. similarly, significant salivary specificity is noted for three bacteria, namely, capnocytophaga gingivalis, p. melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis in  oral cancer patients, making these species salivary markers for the early detection of oral cancers and thus improving the survival rate significantly. also, such high degree of bacterial specificity in oral cancers has also provoked the designing of new treatment options for cancer prevention by way of vaccine delivery. however, for the success of these steps, a deeper exploration into this subject with a greater understanding is warranted.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  == previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. we conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. most injuries were to the hands. fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. the median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. isolates included streptococcus anginosus (52%), staphylococcus aureus (30%), eikenella corrodens (30%), fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and prevotella melaninogenica (22%). candida species were found in 8%. fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, and candida species  were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. many strains of prevotella and s. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.
