TI  == association between the presence of bacterial 16s rna in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (sweden).
AB  == objective: to study bacterial 16s rna in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial dna was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n =  171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). methods: 16s dna pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. results: in 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16s rna were detected.  sequence analysis revealed propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16s rna positive patients). the second most frequent isolate-escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. the other isolates included pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml]. in 25%  of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml. the microorganisms isolated most frequently were: streptococcus, sp. ("viridans group"), veillonella parvula, hemophilus parainfluenzae, lactobacillus, sp., corynebacterium, sp., actinomyces, sp., bacteroides, sp., and hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. the upper range for the  number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  == bacteriological study in chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the bacterial findings of 73 maxillary sinuses in 48 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis, together with 7 non-inflamed sinuses, are reported. employing an intraoperative technique and simultaneous collection of 3 different  types of specimens in the present investigation made possible comparison of their bacterial characteristics. the results indicated that intraoperative culture of antral mucosa seems to provide the most reliable finding of bacterial flora in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the anaerobic bacteria were never found in the mucosal culture of non-inflamed sinus. the anaerobes appeared to invade the sinus cavity following the sealing of the ostium through the lymphatic or venous system and maintain the inflammatory process. microbiological analysis of the results between the infected and non-inflamed sinuses established anaerobic bacteria as the most important pathogen in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the predominant anaerobes recovered in descending order of frequency were veillonella sp., peptococcus sp., propionibacterium acne and anaerobic nonspore-forming gpb. statistical analysis of the results of mucosal culture of inflamed and control materials demonstrated that those aerobic and faculatative bacteria recovered in  the inflamed sinus appeared to be the normal inhabitants of non-inflamed sinus mucosa. the presence of normal flora in the normal healthy sinus mucosa may explain the chain of events that follows the occlusion of the ostium. these aerobic bacteria may become pathogenic and play a role in the pathogenesis of sinusitis.

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

TI  == bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
