predicting inhibition and inactivation of yersinia enterocolitica through lactic  acid production by lactobacillus sakei.
in food technology, there is a need for models taking into account the interactions between microorganisms, in order to correctly predict the safety and shelf life of food products. when leaving these interactions out of consideration, a discrepancy between the model prediction and the actual microbial evolution may occur for certain types of food products. in this study, a model describing the inhibition of the pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica in mono- and coculture with lactobacillus sakei was extended to describe also the subsequent inactivation of y. enterocolitica. during the development of a suitable model structure to describe the inactivation process, biological knowledge about this process was incorporated. the extended model was able to predict evolution of y. enterocolitica in coculture as well as in monoculture.
