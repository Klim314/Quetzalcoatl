TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == intravenous teicoplanin does not prevent clostridium difficile associated diarrhea.
AB  == a 59-year-old man with the diagnosis of endocarditis of the mitral valve due to streptococcus mitis was treated with penicillin g, gentamicin, and later with clindamycin as inpatient for 3 weeks. thereafter outpatient therapy with parenteral teicoplanin 3 x per week was initiated. after 17 days of teicoplanin treatment he developed severe diarrhea, and stool samples were positive for clostridium difficile toxin. in addition to the ongoing parenteral therapy with teicoplanin, oral teicoplanin was administered. on the third day of this regimen  the diarrhea and other disabling symptoms subsided, and test results for c. difficile toxin became negative. oral teicoplanin was continued for 10 days and cleared c. difficile effectively after treatment as assessed by consecutive stool cultures (until 60 days thereafter). the parenteral administration of teicoplanin could not prevent the onset of c. difficile associated diarrhea in this patient,  who previously had been treated with clindamycin. thus, the administration of parenteral teicoplanin does not seem to be a treatment option for c. difficile associated diarrhea in patients in which oral therapy is not possible.
