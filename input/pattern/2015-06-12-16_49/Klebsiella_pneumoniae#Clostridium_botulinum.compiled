TI  - Gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  - Wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.
TI  - Infant botulism mimicking an acute abdomen.
AB  - Botulism is the acute, flaccid paralysis caused by a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. In the infant, clinical symptoms are usually unspecific such as poor feeding, weak suck, feeble cry, drooling, followed by a symmetric, descending, flaccid paralysis beginning with the cranial nerve musculature. The initial symptoms of the disease are often similar to several diseases and therefore differential diagnosis is very difficult and rarely suspected by the physician. Since 2004 only 22 cases of infant botulism have been reported in Italy. Since most paediatricians are unfamiliar with the clinical manifestations of infant botulism, the diagnosis can be easily missed. Hence the disease may well be underestimated and underreported. We report a clinical case of botulism presenting initially with abdominal distention, thereby mimicking acute abdomen.
TI  - Antibody response to bacterial antigens covalently bound to biodegradable polymerized serum albumin beads.
AB  - Model vaccines have been made by covalently linking Clostridium botulinum type D  toxin and Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide antigen to polymerized rabbit serum albumin beads. When injected into rabbits these bead vaccines induced an enhanced production of specific humoral antibody without causing adverse reactions. The adjuvant effect is due to a slow release from the bead structure and offers an alternative to oil emulsions and mineral salt adsorbents.
