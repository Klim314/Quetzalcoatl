TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of indigofera trita linn.
AB  == an in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of indigofera trita l. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. a total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and  2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), salmonella paratyphi a (12.80 mm), streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, s. typhi and burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). the chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), s. typhimurium (12.60 mm), s. paratyphi a, s. brunei and yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). the acetone extract of i. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. epidermidis (18.20 mm), s. typhimurium (14.60 mm), s. infantis (13.80 mm), s. aureus (13.40 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (18.60 mm), s. paratyphi a (14.60 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), s. typhi (12.40 mm), s. aureus, e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium and s. infantis (12.00 mm). aqueous extract  of i. trita considerably inhibited s. epidermidis (13.80 mm), s. paratyphi a and  y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), e. aerogenes and haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). all the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. the result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of i. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.

TI  == measurement of antibacterial activities of t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  a, aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.
