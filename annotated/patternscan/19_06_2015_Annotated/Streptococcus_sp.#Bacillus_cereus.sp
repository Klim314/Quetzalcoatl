TI  == bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. as a unique class ii lantibiotic, bovicin hj50 is produced by streptococcus bovis hj50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. by using its precursor bova as a drive sequence, 16 bova-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. from them, three representative novel lan loci from clostridium perfringens d str. jgs1721, bacillus cereus as 1.348 and b. thuringiensis as 1.013 were identified by pcr screening. the corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. the disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. further analysis indicated  that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin hj50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. this  study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial and antiinsectan phenolic metabolites of dalea searlsiae.
AB  == continued interest in the chemistry of dalea spp. led to investigation of dalea searlsiae, a plant native to areas of the western united states. methanol extractions of d. searlsiae roots and subsequent chromatographic fractionation afforded the new prenylated and geranylated flavanones malheurans a-d (1-4) and known flavanones (5 and 6). known rotenoids (7 and 8) and isoflavones (9 and 10)  were isolated from aerial portions. structure determination of pure compounds was accomplished primarily by extensive 1d- and 2d-nmr spectroscopy. the absolute configurations of compounds 1-5, 7, and 8 were assigned using electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. antimicrobial bioassays revealed significant activity concentrated in the plant roots. compounds 1-6 exhibited mics of 2-8 mug/ml against streptococcus mutans, bacillus cereus, and oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus. aerial metabolites 7-10 were inactive against these organisms, but the presence of 7 and 8 prompted investigation of the antiinsectan activity of d. searlsiae metabolites toward the major crop pest spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm). while compounds 1-10 all caused significant reductions in larval growth rates, associated mortality (33-66%) was  highest with flavanone 4 and rotenoids 7 and 8. these findings suggest a differential allocation of antimicrobial and antiinsectan plant resources to root and aerial portions of the plant, respectively.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in nigeria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital, sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital,  sagamu, nigeria was conducted. sedimentation technique using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). male medical ward (mmw) and male surgical general  (msg) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (ot) was almost free of microbial burden. the bacteria isolates were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included  aspergillus flavus, penicillium sp., fusarium sp., candida albicans and alternaria sp. staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. conclusions: though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of  nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. from the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to  be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.

TI  == microbial contamination associated with consumption and the growth in plastic bottled beverage.
AB  == plastic bottles enable the storage of unfinished beverages, and most of microbial contamination has occurred in the unfinished beverage that was left. therefore, we investigated microorganisms in various beverages contaminated by pouring and drinking directly by mouth from the bottle, and analyzed the growth of microorganisms in the beverages at room temperature. in the pouring test, microbial growth was detected in 60 of 320 samples, and 13 bacterial strains, 49  mold strains, and 8 yeast strains were isolated. molds including cladosporium spp., tramets spp., bjerkandera spp., and penicillium spp. accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. in the drinking test, microbial growth was detected in 181 of 352 samples, and 225 bacterial strains, 27 mold strains and 77 yeast strains were isolated. bacteria including streptococcus spp. such as s. salivarius and staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. enterotoxin-producing s. aureus and bacillus cereus were also isolated. the ph of the beverage influenced the growth of bacteria. the brix values of the beverage did not correlate with the growth of microorganisms.  these results revealed that various microorganisms including foodborne pathogens  were able to grow in numerous types of beverages and that the storage of unfinished beverage in inappropriate condition, such as the storage at room temperature led microorganism to grow easily in beverage. therefore, it is necessary to consume beverages as soon as possible after opening the bottle.

TI  == screening antimicrobial activity of various extracts of urtica dioica.
AB  == urtica dioica or stinging nettle is traditionally used as an herbal medicine in western asia. the current study represents the investigation of antimicrobial activity of u. dioica from nine crude extracts that were prepared using different organic solvents, obtained from two extraction methods: the soxhlet extractor (method i), which included the use of four solvents with ethyl acetate and hexane, or the sequential partitions (method ii) with a five solvent system (butanol). the antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude extracts were tested against 28 bacteria, three yeast strains and seven fungal isolates by the  disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. amoxicillin was used as positive control for bacteria strains, vancomycin for streptococcus sp., miconazole nitrate (30 microg/ml) as positive control for fungi and yeast, and pure methanol (v/v) as negative control. the disc diffusion assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the samples, whilst the broth dilution method was used for the determination of the minimal inhibition concentration (mic). the ethyl acetate and hexane extract from extraction method i (ea i and he i) exhibited highest inhibition against some pathogenic bacteria such as bacillus cereus, mrsa and vibrio parahaemolyticus. a selection of extracts that showed some activity was further tested for the mic and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc). mic values of bacillus subtilis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) using butanol extract of extraction method ii (be ii) were 8.33 and 16.33mg/ml, respectively; while the mic value using ethyl acetate extract of extraction method ii (eae ii) for vibrio parahaemolyticus was 0.13mg/ml. our study showed that 47.06% of extracts inhibited gram-negative (8 out of 17), and 63.63% of extracts also inhibited gram-positive bacteria (7 out of 11); besides,  statistically the frequency of antimicrobial activity was 13.45% (35 out of 342)  which in this among 21.71% belongs to antimicrobial activity extracts from extraction method i (33 out of 152 of crude extracts) and 6.82% from extraction method ii (13 out of 190 of crude extracts). however, crude extracts from method  i exhibited better antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria than the gram-negative bacteria. the positive results on medicinal plants screening for antibacterial activity constitutes primary information for further phytochemical and pharmacological studies. therefore, the extracts could be suitable as antimicrobial agents in pharmaceutical and food industry.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented manzanilla alorena green table olives.
AB  == manzanilla alorena (or alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (dop). the aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (lab) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. a collection of 144 lab obtained from alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (smes) from malaga (spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. rep-pcr clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different smes were lactobacillus pentosus. pediococci were identified as pediococcus parvulus (sme1) and leuconostocs as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (sme1 and sme4). genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees c and in the presence of 6.5% nacl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. however, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. on the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low ph and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == meta-analysis of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents: causative organisms and possible prevention strategies.
AB  == purpose: to report the rates of endophthalmitis and the spectrum of causative organisms after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents and possible prevention strategies. methods: meta-analysis of the u.s. literature from 2005 to 2009 reporting endophthalmitis bacterial isolates after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents and comparison with reports of endophthalmitis bacterial isolates after intraocular surgery in the united states. result: endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection occurred in 52 of 105,536 injections (0.049%) (95% confidence interval  [ci], 0.038-0.065%). among 50 cases of endophthalmitis with bacterial culture isolates, 24 (48.0% [95% ci, 34.8-61.5%]) were culture negative and 26 (52% [95%  ci, 38.5-65.2%]) were culture positive. among the 26 culture-positive isolates, causative organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 17 cases (65.4% [95% ci, 46.0-80.6%]), streptococcus species in 8 cases (30.8% [95% ci, 16.5-50.2%]), and bacillus cereus in 1 case (3.8% [95% ci, 0.9-19.0%]). streptococcus species were significantly more frequent after intravitreal injection than after intraocular surgery in the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study  (29 of 226 isolates, 9.0% [95% ci, 6.3-12.6%], p = 0.005), a report on clear corneal cataract surgery endophthalmitis (6 of 73 isolates, 8.2% [95% ci, 3.9-16.8%], p = 0.022), and a report on postvitrectomy endophthalmitis with no cases of streptococcus species. conclusion: streptococcal isolates are approximately three times more frequent after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection than after intraocular surgery. strategies to consider minimizing oropharyngeal droplet transmission may include avoiding talking, coughing, and sneezing or wearing surgical masks.

TI  == the effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on staphylococcus aureus dmst 4745.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (lg) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on  s. aureus biofilm formation. attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological  changes of s. aureus dmst 4745 were also made. the results demonstrate that s. agalactiae and b. cereus are more susceptible to lg, citral and geraniol than s.  aureus and e. coli. moreover, they also inhibit s. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. the lg appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide bond formation in gram-positive bacterial pili: a qm/mm simulation.
AB  == many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between asn and lys side chains within the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit spy0128 and subsequently in gbs52 from streptococcus agalactiae, in the bcpa major pilin of bacillus cereus and in the rrgb pilin of streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. within each pilin subunit,  intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. these bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. for the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including asn, lys, and a catalytically important acidic glu (or asp) residue are responsible. however, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to  isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as spy0128 and rrgb. this suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. from this mechanistic perspective, we used the qm/mm minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. it  was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia.  more importantly, within the dual active sites of spy0128, glu(117), and glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. this work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of walsura robusta roxb.
AB  == walsura robusta roxb. (family: meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. in the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside a (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of w. robusta. biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and  antigiardial activities was performed. we investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph), hydroxyl radical (oh), and superoxide anion (o(2)) scavenging assays. three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. they scavenged dpph(*) with ic(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microm. we also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with ic(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microm, respectively. other biological activities including  antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and s. pyogenes. aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. however, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of w. robusta on all tested bacterial strains  showed only weak activity, and their mbcs were greater than 25 mg ml(-1). for antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites ml(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg ml(-1) demonstrated no activity (mic > 1000 microg ml(-1)).

TI  == the corynebacterium diphtheriae shaft pilin spaa is built of tandem ig-like modules with stabilizing isopeptide and disulfide bonds.
AB  == cell-surface pili are important virulence factors that enable bacterial pathogens to adhere to specific host tissues and modulate host immune response. relatively  little is known about the structure of gram-positive bacterial pili, which are built by the sortase-catalyzed covalent crosslinking of individual pilin proteins. here we report the 1.6-a resolution crystal structure of the shaft pilin component spaa from corynebacterium diphtheriae, revealing both common and  unique features. the spaa pilin comprises 3 tandem ig-like domains, with characteristic folds related to those typically found in non-pilus adhesins. whereas both the middle and the c-terminal domains contain an intramolecular lys-asn isopeptide bond, previously detected in the shaft pilins of streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus, the middle ig-like domain also harbors a calcium ion, and the c-terminal domain contains a disulfide bond. by mass spectrometry, we show that the spaa monomers are cross-linked in the assembled pili by a lys-thr isopeptide bond, as predicted by previous genetic studies. together, our  results reveal that despite profound dissimilarities in primary sequences, the shaft pilins of gram-positive pathogens have strikingly similar tertiary structures, suggesting a modular backbone construction, including stabilizing intermolecular and intramolecular isopeptide bonds.

TI  == assessment of the medicinal potentials of the methanol extracts of the leaves and stems of buddleja saligna.
AB  == background: buddleja saligna willd (loganiaceae) is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree; trunk short, often gnarled and crooked; crown dense, rounded or domed-shaped; foliage greyish green. the wild olives are traditionally used to lower blood pressures in many parts of the world. in southern africa, bark and leaf decoctions are used to treat colic, coughs, colds, sore eyes, urinary problems and as purgatives. methods: the antibacterial, antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the methanol extracts of the leaves and stems of buddleja saligna were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. spectrophotometry was the basis for the determinations of total phenol, total flavonoids, flavonols, and proanthocyanidins. tannins, quercetin and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. the antioxidant activities of the leaves and stem extracts of buddleja saligna were determined by abts, dpph, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (frap) methods. laboratory isolates of 10 bacteria species which included five gram-positive and five gram-negative strains were used to assay for antibacterial activity of this plant. results: the antioxidant activities of the leaves as determined by the abts and dpph were similar to that of the stem. the flavonoids and the flavonols contents of the leaves were higher than that of the stem but the total phenols, proanthocyanidins and frap activities were higher in the methanol extracts of the stem. the extracts did show activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. for instance, while the methanol extract of the leaves showed good activities on  all the organisms except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa at mics of between 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml, the extract of the stem only showed activities on bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyrogens and pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same concentration. conclusion: the results from this study indicate that the leaves and stem extracts of buddleja saligna possess antioxidant properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger or, acting possibly as primary antioxidants. although, the antibacterial properties of buddleja saligna are not  as effective as the standard drugs-chloramphenicol and streptomycin, they still possess some activity against bacterial strains used in this study. buddleja saligna may therefore be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutical plant-based products.

AB  == skin plays a key role in the daily survival of amphibians. in the present study,  six cdnas encoding amphibian skin antimicrobial peptide precursors from the chinese brown frog rana chensinensis, were cloned and identified as preprobrevinin-1cec, preprobrevinin-1ceb, preprotemporin-1cea, preprotemporin-1ceb, preprotemporin-1cec, and preprochensinin-1. preprotemporin-1cea, ceb, and cec are members of the temporin family, which are usually short, hydrophobic, and c-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial peptides. preprobrevinin-1cea and ceb were identified as members of the brevinin-1 family of antimicrobial peptides, because both peptides contain a "rana box" that is responsible for forming c-terminal cys-bridged cyclic heptapeptides. the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of preprochensinin-1 were not similar to any known amphibian skin defensive peptides. four bioactive peptides were chemically synthesized according to the deduced amino acid sequences of six prepropeptides from r. chensinensis skin, and their antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and haemolytic properties were evaluated. all of  the synthesized peptides inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria. brevinin-1cea showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. the novel amphibian skin peptide chensinin-1 was active against bacillus cereus and streptococcus lactis at a concentration of 11.6 microm, but did not inhibit the growth of mcf-7 and hela cells at 200 microm, and had no haemolytic activity at a concentration of 500 microm. temporin-1cea exhibited the greatest ability to inhibit the growth of mcf-7 cells. its antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities may be due to its high degree of alpha-helical confirmation and amphipathic nature.

TI  == fluorescent-box-pcr for resolving bacterial genetic diversity, endemism and biogeography.
AB  == background: box-a1r-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr (box-pcr) is one  of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. however the traditional separation of box-pcr patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. the aim of this research was to set up  a fluorescent box-pcr (f-box-pcr) assay in which separation of pcr products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. f-box-pcr was compared with the  traditional box-pcr using bacterial strains with different g+c content (bacillus  cereus; escherichia coli; isolates of the family geodermatophilaceae). resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, pcr reactions and independent dna extractions. box-pcr and f-box-pcr were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from cagliari, italy, and 45 strains of streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product matsoni, collected in different locations in georgia. results: fluorophore 6-fam  proved more informative than hex and box-pcr both in agarose gel electrophoresis  (p < 0.004 and p < 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with  hex, p < 2 x 10(-7)). 6-fam- and hex-based f-box-pcr respectively detected up to  12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than box-pcr. replicate separations of f-box-pcr showed an accuracy of the size calling of +/- 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to +/- 10 bp at 2000 bp. cluster analysis of f-box-pcr profiles grouped m. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and s. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of matsoni, but  resulted intermixed when a box-pcr dataset was used. conclusion: f-box-pcr represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both  in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.

TI  == towards on-site pathogen detection using antibody-based sensors.
AB  == in this paper, the recent progress within biosensors for plant pathogen detection will be reviewed. bio-recognition layers on sensors can be designed in various ways, however the most popular approach is to immobilise antibodies for specific  capture of analytes. focus will be put on antibody surface-immobilisation strategies as well as the use of antibodies in the widely used sensors, quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance and cantilevers. we will describe the available data on antibody-based plant pathogen detection and furthermore use examples from detection of the pathogens salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, bacillus cereus, bacillus anthracis, campylobacter and escherichia coli. we will touch upon optimal assay design and further discuss the strengths and limitations of current sensor technologies for detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi.

TI  == single-chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen p23 of cryptosporidium parvum.
AB  == cryptosporidium parvum, an apicomplexan parasite transmitted via animal fecal wastes, is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis. clones were selected from 2  synthetic naive human single-chain variable fragment (scfv) phagemid libraries that bound to the recombinant p23 protein of c. parvum. panning the tomlinson i and j phagemid libraries resulted in 6 distinct clones. two clones had full-length scfv sequences, while the remaining clones were either truncated or missing a section of the heavy chain. despite these differences, all clones were  able to detect both native c. parvum proteins and recombinant p23. none of the selected clones cross-reacted with escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, giardia lamblia (cysts or trophozoites), or with s16, another dominant surface antigen on c. parvum sporozoites. clones expressed as the scfv-giiip fusion construct in soluble form detected c. parvum.  panning from naive libraries is a useful method for isolation and identification  of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and immunotherapy.

TI  == collagen's triglycine repeat number and phylogeny suggest an interdomain transfer event from a devonian or silurian organism into trichodesmium erythraeum.
AB  == two competing effects at two vastly different scales may explain collagen's current translation length. the necessity to have long molecules for maintaining  mechanical integrity at the organism and supraorganism scales may be limited by the need to have small molecules capable of robust self-assembly at the nanoscale. the triglycine repeat regions of all 556 currently cataloged organisms with collagen-like genes were ranked by length. this revealed a sharp boundary in the gxy transcript number at 1032 amino acids (344 gxy repeats). an anomalous exception, however, is the intron-free trichodesmium erythraeum collagen gene. immunogold atomic force microscopy reveals, for the first time, the presence of a collagen-like protein in t. erythraeum. a phylogenetic protein sequence analysis  which includes vertebrates, nonvertebrates, shrimp white spot syndrome virus, streptococcus equi, and bacillus cereus predicts that the collagen-like sequence  may have emerged shortly after the divergence of fibrillar and nonfibrillar collagens. the presence of this anomalously long collagen gene within a prokaryote may represent an interdomain transfer from eukaryotes into prokaryotes that gives t. erythraeum the ability to form blooms that cover hundreds of square kilometers of ocean. we propose that the collagen gene entered the prokaryote intron-free only after it had been molded by years of mechanical selective pressure in larger organisms and only after large, dense food sources such as marine vertebrates became available. this anomalously long collagen-like sequence may explain t. erythraeum's ability to aggregate and thus concentrate its toxin for food-source procurement.

TI  == a small-scale, low-cost isolation system for the incubation and rearing of low bacterial load chicks as a model to study microbial-intestinal interactions.
AB  == a small-scale, economical isolator system was adapted to hatch and raise chicks in a bacteria-free environment as a means to observe bacterial interactions with  the intestinal mucosa during early development. the design and construction of flexible plastic isolators for incubation and brooding are described along with methodologies for preparation of eggs for entry into the isolators, incubation and hatching. two trials were conducted, the first in august 2005 and the second  in march 2006. results from both trials showed no differences in body weights of  chicks raised in isolation when compared with those raised conventionally. growth of bacteria was detected from rectal swabs at day 2 post-hatch, with both trials, showing a light growth of bacillus sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci and haemolytic streptococcus in trial 1, and a light growth of bacillus cereus only in trial 2. although not germfree, the growth of bacteria in chicks raised in isolation was decreased or absent when compared with chicks raised conventionally. feed was negative for contamination and surface swabs of equipment were also negative until day 3 post-hatch, suggesting possible contamination within the eggs themselves. despite the presence of bacterial species, the isolator system was successful in producing low bacterial load chicks for comparison studies with conventionally raised chicks.

TI  == [microbiological monitoring of milk samples and surface samples in a hospital infant formula room].
AB  == objective: analyze the microbiological quality of reconstituted milk formulas and the surface hygiene in a hospital infant formula room, in the context of a worldwide emergence of enterobacter sakazakii infections. material and methods: over 3.5 years, monthly samples of reconstituted milk formulas as well as quarterly infant formula room surface samples were taken for bacteriological analysis. results: of the 156 formulas analyzed, 54 carried microorganisms but no pathogenic bacteria. the presence of bacillus species was found in 54% of the formulas for premature infants and in 19% of the other formulas (significant difference). bacteria, probably brought by operators during reconstitution of the powdered formulas, were found in four of 156 samples (two negative-coagulase staphylococcus, one alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and one clostridium bifermentans). surfaces were studied using 117 samples divided into 11 series: 4.3% of the points carried pathogenic bacteria (enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas fluorescens, bulhkholderia cepacia, staphylococcus aureus). discussion: the presence of bacillus species should be analyzed thoroughly so as to differentiate bacillus cereus from other nonpathogenic species. the microbiological analysis techniques used for reconstituted infant formulas can be simplified. conclusion:  the quality of the infant formulas seems satisfactory. hygiene practices provide  good microbiological quality in reconstituted infant milk formulas. microbiological monitoring of these preparations and the infant formula room surfaces is an important aspect of the quality assurance policy, which makes it possible to take corrective measures when an unsatisfactory result is found.

AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

AB  == piper solmsianum c. dc. var. solmsianum (piperaceae) is a shrub commonly found in areas with wet tropical soils. other piper species have been used in folk medicine as antitumoral and antiseptic agents. we studied the crude methanolic extract, some organic fractions and compounds isolated from this plant for possible antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the bioautographic assays disclosed three inhibition zones. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined showing excellent activity, particularly against the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and streptococcus agalactiae). it appears that the antimicrobial activity of piper solmsianum is related mainly to the presence of conocarpan and eupomatenoid-5 (neolignans). however another, as yet unidentified, active compound could also be extracted from the plant.

TI  == differential identification of bacillus anthracis from environmental bacillus species using microarray analysis.
AB  == aims: to determine whether microarray analysis could be employed for the differential identification of a range of environmental bacillus sp. from four strains of bacillus anthracis. methods and results: oligonucleotide probes were designed that were specific to virulence factor genes of b. anthracis (pag, lef and cap), the variable number tandem repeat region of the b. anthracis vrra gene  and to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region (its) and pleiotropic regulator (plcr) regions of the bacillus cereus subgroup species. generic probes were also designed to hybridize with conserved regions of the 16s  rrna genes of bacillus (as a positive control), neisseria sp., pseudomonas sp., streptococcus sp., mycobacterium sp. and to all members of the enterobacteriaceae to allow simultaneous detection of these bacteria. identification of b. anthracis was found to rely entirely on hybridization of dna specific to regions of the pag, lef and cap genes. cross-reaction was observed between b. anthracis and other bacillus species with all the other bacillus probes tested. results obtained using microarray hybridizations were confirmed using conventional microbiological techniques and found to have very high comparability. conclusions: microarray-based assays are an effective method for the identification of b. anthracis from mixed-culture environmental samples without problems of false-positivity that have been observed with conventional pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: identification of environmental bacillus sp. by conventional pcr is prone to potential for reporting false-positives. this study provides a method for the exclusion of such isolates.

TI  == in vitro studies of the digestion of caprine whey proteins by human gastric and duodenal juice and the effects on selected microorganisms.
AB  == the in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (hgj) at ph 2.5 and human duodenal juice (hdj) at ph 7.5. different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (hgj) and second (hdj) enzymatic degradation. the minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and ig were rapidly degraded by hgj, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. further digestion with hdj still showed intact beta-lg, and the main part of alpha-la also remained unchanged. the protein degradation by hgj and hdj was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at ph 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at ph 7.5. the two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. the digests after treatment with hgj and hdj were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and streptococcus mutans. active growing cells of e. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with hgj and hdj. cells of b. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with hgj, while the products after further degradation with hdj demonstrated no significant effect. screenings performed on cells of lb. rhamnosus gg and s. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.

TI  == evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) bacterial contamination (pbc) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. it is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. study design and methods: pbc was studied  by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from july 1991 to december 2004. active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old plts at issue and intermittent use of gram stain, ph measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (sdp) units. results: active surveillance detected  38 instances of pbc, 7 in sdp units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor plt units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; n = 27), staphylococcus aureus (4), bacillus cereus (1), serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 s. bovis, 1 s. uberis), and cons with viridans group streptococcus (1). only one instance of contamination, caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per ml at time of issue. pbc was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through gram stain screening. transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). ph testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of sdp units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. conclusion: improved active surveillance methods for detecting pbc are needed to improve the  safety of plt transfusions.

TI  == structural elements in dextran glucosidase responsible for high specificity to long chain substrate.
AB  == dextran glucosidase from streptococcus mutans (smdg) and bacillus oligo-1,6-glucosidases, members of glycoside hydrolase family 13 enzymes, have the high sequence similarity. each of them is specific to alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkage at the non-reducing end of substrate to liberate glucose. the activities  toward long isomaltooligosaccharides were different in both enzymes, in which smdg and oligo-1,6-glucosidase showed high and low activities, respectively. we determined the structural elements essential for high activity toward long-chain  substrate. from conformational comparison between smdg and b. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase (three-dimensional structure has been solved), trp238 and short beta-->alpha loop 4 of smdg were considered to contribute to the high activity to long-chain substrate. w238a had similar kcat/km value for isomaltotriose to that for isomaltose, suggesting that the affinity of subsite +2 was decreased by trp238 replacement. trp238 mutants as well as the chimeric enzyme having longer beta-->alpha loop 4 of b. subtilis oligo-1,6-glucosidase showed lower preference for long-chain substrates, indicating that both trp238 and short beta-->alpha loop 4 were important for high activity to long-chain substrates.

TI  == the impact of homologous recombination on the generation of diversity in bacteria.
AB  == the imprint of demographic and selective processes on bacterial population structure needs to be evaluated as deviation from the expectations of an appropriate null neutral model. we explore the impact of varying the population mutation and recombination rates theta and rho on ideal populations, using a recently developed model of neutral drift at multiple loci. this model may be fitted to experimental data to provide estimates of these parameters, and we do so for seven bacterial species (neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, helicobacter pylori, burkholderia  pseudomallei and bacillus cereus), illustrating that bacterial species vary extensively in these fundamental parameters. historically, the influence of recombination has often been estimated through its influence on the index of association i(a). we show that this may be relatively insensitive to changes in either mutation or recombination rates. it is known that biased sampling can lead to artificially high estimates of i(a). we therefore provide a method of precisely separating the effects of such bias and true linkage between alleles. we also demonstrate that by fitting the neutral model to experimental data, more  informative and precise estimates of the relative roles of recombination and mutation may be obtained.

AB  == background: bacillus cereus, bacillus anthracis and bacillus thuringiensis belong to the genetically close-knit bacillus cereus sensu lato group, a family of rod-shaped gram-positive bacteria. paw63 is the first conjugative plasmid from the b. cereus group to be completely sequenced. results: the 71,777 bp nucleotide sequence of paw63 reveals a modular structure, including a 42 kb tra region encoding homologs of the type iv secretion systems components virb11, virb4 and vird4, as well as homologs of gram-positive conjugation genes from enterococcus,  lactococcus, listeria, streptococcus and staphylococcus species. it also firmly establishes the existence of a common backbone between paw63, pxo2 from bacillus  anthracis and pbt9727 from the pathogenic bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 97-27. the alignment of these three plasmids highlights the presence of well conserved segments, in contrast to distinct regions of high sequence plasticity. the study of their specific differences has provided a three-point reference framework that can be exploited to formulate solid hypotheses concerning the functionalities and the molecular evolution of these three closely related plasmids. this has provided insight into the chronology of  their divergence, and led to the discovery of two type ii introns on paw63, matching copies of the mobile element is231l in different loci of pxo2 and pbt9727, and the identification on pxo2 of a 37 kb pathogenicity island (pai) containing the anthrax capsule genes. conclusion: the complete sequence determination of paw63 has led to a functional map of the plasmid yielding insights into its conjugative apparatus, which includes t4ss-like components, as  well as its resemblance to other large plasmids of gram-positive bacteria. of particular interest is the extensive homology shared between paw63 and pxo2, the  second virulence plasmid of b. anthracis, as well as pbt9727 from the pathogenic  strain b. thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 97-27.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == host-pathogen interactions: a proteomic view.
AB  == host-pathogen interactions reflect the balance of host defenses and pathogen virulence mechanisms. advances in proteomic technologies now afford opportunities to compare protein content between complex biologic systems ranging from cells to animals and clinical samples. thus, it is now possible to characterize host-pathogen interactions from a global proteomic view. most reports to date focus on cataloging protein content of pathogens and identifying virulence-associated proteins or proteomic alterations in host response. a more in-depth understanding of host-pathogen interactions has the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity and virulence, thereby defining novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. in addition, proteomic characterization of the host response can provide pathogen-specific host biomarkers for rapid pathogen detection and characterization, as well as for early and specific detection of infectious diseases. a review of host-pathogen interactions focusing on proteomic analyses of both pathogen and host will be presented. relevant genomic studies and host model systems will be also be discussed.

TI  == penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery  between september 1 and december 31, 2003. aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (mic(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. however, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h  vitreous group for staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. the pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous  levels can be achieved after topical administration. further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  == candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-gc gram-positive bacteria, thermotogales and bacteroidetes/chlorobi. this allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. in particular, orthologs of ygea of escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. three new families of histidine transporters  were predicted, orthologs of yuif and yvsh of bacillus subtilis, and lysq of lactococcus lactis. in pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thra was predicted to be regulated not only  by threonine and isoleucine, as in e. coli, but also by methionine. in alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvih was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in bacillus cereus and clostridium difficile, and by histidine t-boxes in l. lactis and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == phytoestrogen genistein as an anti-staphylococcal agent.
AB  == the soybean-derived isoflavone genistein has been shown to exert beneficial effects on many disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. the effects of genistein on mammalian cells are mediated by its abilities to inhibit  topoisomerase ii and protein tyrosine kinase. in order to examine the potential antibacterial activities of genistein, we incubated the bacteria with various concentrations of this compound for different periods of time and assessed the viable counts. exposure to genistein exhibited an inhibitory effect on all staphylococcal strains tested, including methicillin-resistant strains. furthermore, the growth of streptococcus pasteurianus, bacillus cereus, and helicobacter pylori was clearly inhibited by genistein, whereas escherichia coli  growth was not suppressed. daidzein, which is structurally similar to genistein,  but deficient in topoisomerase ii inhibitory activity, also inhibited the growth  of staphylococcus aureus, albeit with lower potency than genistein. our results indicate that genistein exerts potent antibacterial properties in vitro, which are possibly mediated by the stabilization of the covalent topoisomerase ii-dna cleavage complex.

AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from thymus spinulosus ten. (lamiaceae).
AB  == the chemical composition of essential oils from aerial parts of thymus spinulosus ten. (lamiaceae) is reported. four oils from plants growing in different environmental conditions were characterized by gc and gc-ms methods; the oils seem to indicate a new chemotype in the genus thymus. influences of soil and altitude characteristics on the essential oil composition are discussed. the oils showed antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimuium ty2, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa) bacteria.

TI  == horizontal transfer of drug-resistant aminoacyl-transfer-rna synthetases of anthrax and gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the screening of new antibiotics against several bacterial strains often reveals  unexpected occurrences of natural drug resistance. two examples of this involve specific inhibitors of staphylococcus aureus isoleucyl-transfer-rna synthetase 1  (ilers1) and, more recently, streptococcus pneumoniae methionyl-trna synthetase 1 (metrs1). in both cases, resistance is due to the presence of a second gene that  encodes another synthetase (ilers2 or metrs2). here, we show that both s. pneumoniae metrs2 and s. aureus ilers2 have closely related homologues in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. furthermore, similar to drug-resistant pathogens, strains of b. anthracis and its closest relative, b. cereus, also have wild-type iles1 and mets1 genes. clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gangrene, also has two mets genes, whereas oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from deep-sea sediments has a single iles2-type gene. this study shows the importance of understanding complex  evolutionary networks of ancient horizontal gene transfer for the development of  novel antibiotics.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == study of the bacterial load in a gelatine production process focussed on bacillus and related endosporeforming genera.
AB  == gelatine is an animal protein with many industrial applications. previous studies pointed out that endosporeforming bacteria, belonging to the genus bacillus or related genera, might contaminate and survive the production process of gelatine, leading to products of low quality and safety. the aim of this study is to determine the bacterial diversity of contaminants isolated from a gelatine production chain with emphasis on aerobic endosporeforming bacteria. contaminants were isolated from samples taken at five crucial points along two different production lines of a gelatine production process and from water supplies used for extraction and cooling. gaschromatographic methyl ester analysis of fatty acids was performed to differentiate isolates at the genus level. apart from members of the genus bacillus or related endosporeforming genera, also members of salmonella, kluyvera, staphylococcus, burkholderia, enterococcus, pseudomonas, yersinia, streptococcus and brevundimonas could be detected. isolates identified  as belonging to bacillus and related endosporeforming genera were further characterised by gelatinase tests, rep-pcr and 16s rdna sequencing. all these isolates showed the ability to liquefy gelatine. endosporeforming isolates were assigned to bacillus licheniformis, b. fumarioli, members of the b. cereus group, b. badius, b. coagulans, b. subtilis, brevibacillus agri, alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and a yet undescribed paenibacillus species.

TI  == presence of erm genes among macrolide-resistant gram-positive bacteria isolated from danish farm soil.
AB  == the presence of erm genes was investigated among macrolide-resistant gram-positive bacteria isolated from soil samples collected from four danish farms that had been treated with animal waste. soil samples were collected before, a few days after spread and 1 1/2 months and 5 months later. in 33% (9/27) of these isolates, an erm gene was detected using pcr. eight isolates were positive for erm(b) and one isolate was positive for erm(c). no isolates contained erm(a), erm(d) or erm(f). the positive isolates were identified to genus level. two erm(b) positive isolates were identified as enterococcus spp., and the erm(c)-positive isolate as a streptococcus spp., probably indicating survival from animal waste. the remaining six erm(b) positive isolates all belonged to the bacillus cereus group. the erm(b) gene has not previously been identified in b. cereus but is frequently found among enterococci. this result could indicate horizontal transfer from bacteria of animal origin to indigenous soil bacteria.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

AB  == aims: to determine the role of lactoperoxidase (lp) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. methods and results: four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (lp)-enriched ultra-heat treated (uht) milk after subsequent pasteurization. milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees c/15 s and 80 degrees c/15 s to determine the effect of the lp system on the micro-organisms. an active lp system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (kq) of milks inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees c, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees c, presumably due to virtual inactivation of lp at 80 degrees c. however, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the kq of milks challenged with bacillus cereus spores. conclusions: this study suggests that the lp system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater kq of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees c/15 s compared with 80 degrees c/15 s. significance and impact of the study: the study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of propolis extracts on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to various antibiotics and some microorganisms.
AB  == abstract propolis is collected by worker honey bees from the trees. the bees pack propolis on their hind legs, carry it to their colony, and use it as a sterilant  in the hive. propolis has also been used by humans since early times for various  purposes and, especially, as a medicine because of its antimicrobial properties.  in this study, antimicrobial effects of propolis samples on three escherichia coli and two staphylococcus aureus strains that are multiresistant to antibiotics and on salmonella typhimurium, bruceila abortus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, candida tropicalis, and aspergillus niger were studied. propolis extracts were prepared with acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso). at concentrations of 10 and 25 ml, propolis extracts affected all of the  microorganisms in acetone and dmso in concentrations of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 ppm. the results detected in this in vitro study provided evidence that propolis  may be used as an antimicrobial agent against many microorganisms.

TI  == factors affecting the resting ph of in vitro human microcosm dental plaque and streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  == the aim was to examine factors that potentially control the resting ph, defined as the ph unaffected by meals, of microcosm dental plaques and streptococcus mutans biofilms under standard conditions, and to examine the effect of supplying urea at concentrations found intraorally. microcosm plaques were cultured from plaque bacteria-enriched saliva in an 'artificial mouth' with a continuous supply of a medium including 0.25% mucin [basal medium mucin, (bmm), 3.6 ml/hr per plaque] and a periodic supply of sucrose. the steady-state resting ph was 6.4 (range +/- 0.1) in bmm containing no urea and supplied at the standard flowrate.  this is a robust property of the ecosystem. in one experiment with a replicated (n = 9) set of measurements, the resting ph was approx. ph 6.3, 6.4, 6.7 and 7.3  with 0, 1, 5 and 20 mmol/l urea in the bmm. the magnitude of sucrose- and urea-induced ph responses was unaffected by elevating the resting ph to produce parallel ph curves. the sucrose-induced ph curves were analogous to those classically reported by stephan that showed an association between caries activity and increasingly acidic plaque ph responses to glucose. stopping the bmm flow caused a ph rise, indicating continuing net alkali generation from bmm components in the absence of a fluid flow. step. mutans monoculture biofilms had  an acidic resting ph of 5.0 to 5.3, which increased to 6.8 following an adventitious superinfection by bacillus cereus. it was concluded that the resting ph in plaque results from a delicate balance between alkali and acid generation,  which is in turn dependent both on the bacterial composition of the plaque and on the supply of substrates and buffers from, and metabolite clearance into, flowing oral fluid. in vivo the resting ph will vary with site-specific changing saliva flows. urea continuously supplied at concentrations normal for saliva and gingival crevicular fluid can raise the resting ph of microcosm plaque by an amount tat in vivo would probably be significant in reducing dental caries.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == studies of one invasive and two noninvasive methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates.
AB  == recently, a new method for noninvasive detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates was described [arpi et al.: vox sang 1993;65:335-336]. a co2-sensitive label is applied on the outer surface of the plastic container of the platelet concentrate. when any contaminating bacteria have increased the pco2 to a certain level the label changes color, indicating bacterial growth. we have  studied this technique and applied such sensitive labels both directly onto pcs and onto plastic bags with culture medium into which platelet contents have been  transferred. however, in both cases the sensitivity of the technique was found insufficient for practical quality control of pcs. there seem to be two problems  with this principle: (1) platelets produce co2 and (2) a considerable amount of the gas passes beside the detection label, in this way decreasing the sensitivity of detection by the label. this noninvasive technique was compared with an invasive method using automated bacterial culture, which was found sensitive and  rapid.

TI  == dicranin, an antimicrobial and 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor from the moss dicranum scoparium.
AB  == extracts of nine mosses, collected in switzerland, were screened for antimicrobial, antioxidative, and 15-lipoxygenase (15-lpo) inhibitory activities. the ch2cl2 extract of dicranum scoparium was found to possess pronounced antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. in addition, inhibition of soybean 15-lpo occurred at very low concentration. phytochemical investigation of this extract afforded z,z,z-octadeca-6-yne-9,12,15-trienoic acid [1] by a combination of chromatographic techniques. this compound, named dicranin [1], was found to be responsible for most of the biological activity. the strongest antimicrobial effect was observed against streptococcus faecalis (disc  diffusion assay). in contrast to the ch2cl2 extract of d. scoparium, dicranin was inactive against e. coli. dicranin was identified by ir, ms, and nmr spectroscopy. a 2d inadequate experiment confirmed the structure and yielded the  assignment of all 13c-nmr signals.

TI  == resistance to the antimicrobial agents of bacteria isolated from non-sterile pharmaceuticals.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial resistance of 391 bacterial strains isolated from 389  samples of oral and topical medicaments was examined. the numbers of strains isolated (and percentage of samples that present them) were: 234 bacillus (32.1%), 79 staphylococcus (13.6%), 46 micrococcus (11.3%), nine pseudomonas (1.5%), eight acinetobacter (1.5%), five enterococcus (1.2%), three alcaligenes (0.8%), two escherichia and enterobacter (0.5%), one each providencia, serratia and streptococcus (0.2%). gram-positive bacteria were isolated from topical and oral medicaments and gram-negative rods were detected only in topical medicaments. the 97.4% of bacillus strains were resistant to lincomycin and b. cereus was resistant to beta-lactam and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. staphylococcus spp. showed a high percentage of resistant strains to ampicillin (51.8%), tetracycline (40.5%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (48.1%). staphylococcus epidermidis had the highest number of multiresistant strains. the  23.9% of micrococcus strains were resistant to colistin. enterococcus and streptococcus strains showed multiresistance to penicillin g, aminoglycosides and erythromycin. the 61.5% of gram-negative rod strains showed multiresistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and erythromycin; pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of the tet(l) tetracycline resistance determinant encoded by plasmid pste1 from staphylococcus hyicus.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance (tet) gene and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pste1 from staphylococcus hyicus, was determined. the tet gene was inducible by tetracycline and encoded a hydrophobic  protein of 458 amino acids. comparisons between the predicted amino acid sequences of the pste1-encoded tet from s. hyicus and the previously sequenced tet k variants from staphylococcus aureus, tet l variants from bacillus cereus, bacillus stearothermophilus, and bacillus subtilis, tet m variants from streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus as well as tet o from streptococcus mutans were performed. an alignment of tet amino acid sequences revealed the presence of 30 conserved amino acids among these tet variants. on the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. it demonstrated  large evolutionary distances between the tet m and tet o variants on one hand and the tet k and tet l variants on the other hand. the pste1-encoded tet proved to be closely related to the tet l proteins originally found on small bacillus plasmids. the observed extensive similarities in the nucleotide sequences of the  tet genes and in the deduced tet amino acid sequences allowed the assignment of the pste1-encoded tet to the tet proteins of class l.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == the bactericidal activity of a deuteroporphyrin-hemin mixture on gram-positive bacteria. a microbiological and spectroscopic study.
AB  == the combined antibacterial activity of various porphyrins with hemin on gram-positive bacteria was studied. protoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin derivative and deuteroporphyrin show only a marginal inhibitory effect in the dark. however, hemin has a strong cytotoxic effect which is independent of illumination and is equally strong in the dark. the disadvantage of hemin treatment is that it is temporary. in this study, we have demonstrated that a combination of deuteroporphyrin and hemin has a unique cytotoxic activity on staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus. the effect of the combined compound is stronger than that of the separate constituents, and is as strong in  the dark as in the light. only 0.005% of the initial s. aureus population survive after a 2 h treatment. absorption and fluorescence spectra of hemin-deuteroporphyrin mixtures in water and liposomes suggest the formation of a species with spectroscopic properties which are different from those of the two constituents.

(6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

AB  == thermograms obtained by differential scanning calorimetry of a range of bacteria  of different heat resistances were compared. equations were derived to calculate  the rate at which the numbers of viable organisms in a calorimeter decline as the temperature is raised at a constant rate. vegetative bacteria scanned at 10 degrees c min-1 showed multi-peaked thermograms with four major peaks (denoted m, n, p and q) occurring in the regions 68-73, 77-84, 89-99 and 105-110 degrees c respectively. exceptions were that peak m (the largest peak) occurred at 79-82 degrees c in bacillus stearothermophilus and an additional peak, r, was detected  in escherichia coli at 119 degrees c. at temperatures below the main peak m there were major differences in thermograms between species. there was a direct relationship between the onset of thermal denaturation and the thermoresistance of different organisms. heat-sensitive organisms displayed thermogram features which were absent in the more heat-resistant types. when samples were cooled to 5 degrees c and re-heated, a small endothermic peak, pr, was observed at the same temperature as p. peaks p and pr were identified as the melting endotherms of dna. in all vegetative organisms examined, maximum death rates, computed from published d and z values, occurred at temperatures above the onset of thermal denaturation, i.e. cell death and irreversible denaturation of cell components occurred within the same temperature range.

AB  == the activity of a novel macrolide, ru 28965, was compared to that of erythromycin against gram-positive organisms isolated mainly from cancer patients. ru 28965 was active against streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcal groups a, b and g. it was also active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes. its activity against these organisms was generally equal to that of erythromycin. ru 28965 was moderately active against enterococci and inactive  against jk diphtheroids and three different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. organisms resistant to erythromycin were also resistant to ru 28965.

TI  == a preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in nigeria.
AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == use of microbial beta-lactamase to destroy penicillin added to milk.
AB  == a simple method is described for destruction of penicillin residues in bulk milk  to an undetectable amount (less than .003 u/ml) with commercially available crude beta-lactamase enzyme. milk containing .1 or .5 u/ml penicillin g was treated with .01 to 1.0 mu/ml of beta-lactamase (bacillus cereus) for up to 96 h. the bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis assay was used to quantify penicillin in milk between .003 to 1.0 u/ml. the .5 u/ml of penicillin g was reduced to an undetectable amount within 18 h at 4 degrees c by 1.0 mu/ml of beta-lactamase. the development of titratable acidity over 5 to 6 h in contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase and inoculated with streptococcus  thermophilus gh, streptococcus cremoris, streptococcus lactis, or a commercial starter culture was the same as for control milk samples containing no additives  or only enzyme. pilot-scale manufacture of swiss and cheddar cheeses from contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase yielded cheeses of comparable quality, to control cheeses produced from penicillin-free milk. there were no delays in acid production as judged from ph measurements during production and ripening of the cheeses. about 50% of beta-lactamase activity added to milk remained after pasteurization at 63 degrees c for 30 min. the safety for human consumption of cheese containing small quantities of penicillin degradation products from milk treated with beta-lactamase remains to be established.

TI  == murine monoclonal anti-dna autoantibodies bind to endogenous bacteria.
AB  == several bacterial species (including streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli) were tested for their ability to react with monoclonal anti-dna antibodies that were derived from mrl-lpr/lpr mice. s. faecalis reacted with 8/15 of such antibodies. the binding was unaffected by dnase, but it was competitively inhibited by dna. f(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with the bacteria, but fc fragments did not. phospholipids extracted from the bacterial cells were able to bind to three representative anti-dna antibodies that also bound to whole bacteria. the results suggest that bacterial phospholipids might provide an immunogenic stimulus for the production of antibodies that cross-react with dna. we propose that some anti-dna auto-antibodies and anti-bacterial antibodies evolve from a restricted group of antibodies with high avidity for the phosphodiester groups that occur in dna and bacterial cells walls.

TI  == beta-casomorphin immunoreactive materials in cows' milk incubated with various bacterial species.
AB  == to obtain information about the possible release of beta-casomorphins from beta-casein under in vitro conditions, cows' milk was incubated with 13 strains of gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial species isolated from bovine milk. after incubation periods of 1-24 d, milk samples were assayed for beta-casomorphin-4, -5, -6 or -7 immunoreactive materials. in general, no beta-casomorphin immunoreactive material was found in samples incubated with non-caseolytic strains, e.g. pseudomonas putida or streptococcus faecalis subsp.  faecalis; however, high levels were found in several samples incubated with caseolytic strains, e.g. ps. aeruginosa or bacillus cereus. when such materials were present, the amounts of beta-casomorphin-4, -6 or -7 greatly exceeded beta-casomorphin-5 immunoreactivity. it was concluded that while some of these materials probably represented authentic beta-casomorphins, others were more likely to be beta-casomorphin precursors.

AB  == anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids were prepared and tested for antimicrobial activity. while these anilides were ineffective against gram-negative organisms, there was a good correlation between chemical structure  and biological activity against gram-positive species. both the nature and position of the benzene ring substituents and the length of the carbon side chain affected the activity and specificity of the compounds. the highest activity was  observed when the acyl or sulfuryl moiety had a c7-c9 side chain attached. the conh and so2nh bridging groups were equally effective. the attachment of cooh or  cooch3 groups in the omega-position did not effect activity, but the substitution of the acidic proton of the sulfonamide group by an alkyl group rendered the compound inactive. six compounds, which were substituted anilides of sulfonic acids, fatty acids, or the analagous alpha-methylene-substituted acids, were bacteriostatic at 10 ppm against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus plantarum. one of these compounds, 2-hydroxy-5-nitroanilide of alpha-methylenedecanoic acid, was bactericidal at 1 ppm.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis of the hemolysin (cereolysin) determinant from bacillus cereus.
AB  == from a cosmid gene bank of bacillus cereus gp4 in escherichia coli we isolated clones which, after several days of incubation, formed hemolysis zones on erythrocyte agar plates. these clones contained recombinant cosmids with b. cereus dna insertions of varying lengths which shared some common restriction fragments. the smallest insertion was recloned as a psti fragment into pjkk3-1, a shuttle vector which replicates in bacillus subtilis and e. coli. when this recombinant plasmid (pjkk3-1 hly-1) was transformed into e. coli, it caused hemolysis on erythrocyte agar plates, but in liquid assays no external or internal hemolytic activity could be detected with the e. coli transformants. b.  subtilis carrying the same plasmid exhibited hemolytic activity at levels comparable to those of the b. cereus donor strain. the hemolysin produced in b. subtilis seemed to be indistinguishable from cereolysin in its sensitivity to cholesterol, activation by dithiothreitol, and inactivation by antibodies raised  against cereolysin. when the recombinant dna carrying the cereolysin gene was used as a probe in hybridization experiments with chromosomal dna from a streptolysin o-producing strain of streptococcus pyogenes or from listeriolysin-producing strains of listeria monocytogenes, no positive hybridization signals were obtained. these data suggest that the genes for these  three sh-activated cytolysins do not have extended sequence homology.

TI  == streptococcus plasmid pam alpha 1 is a composite of two separable replicons, one  of which is closely related to bacillus plasmid pbc16.
AB  == a tetracycline resistance plasmid of streptococcus faecalis, pam alpha 1, is shown to contain two independent sets of replication functions, separated from each other on either side by short (300- to 400-base-pair) sequences of homology. the homologous sequences are oriented as direct repeats and therefore permit the  dissociation of pam alpha 1 into its component replicons, referred to here as pam alpha 1 delta 1 and pam alpha 1 delta 2, as the reciprocal products of a simple intramolecular recombination. pam alpha 1 delta 1 is a 4.6-kilobase plasmid which carries the tet gene, and pam alpha 1 delta 2 is a 5.1-kilobase plasmid which carries no known selectable marker. pam alpha 1 delta 1 is shown to replicate efficiently in bacillus subtilis and to confer tetracycline resistance on bacillus hosts. we demonstrate by restriction mapping analysis that pam alpha 1 delta 1 is virtually identical to a 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid  of bacillus cereus, pbc16, which is known to show extensive homology to plasmid isolates from staphylococcus species (such as pub110), as well as from other bacillus species. the pam alpha 1 delta 1-pbc16-pub110 replicon thus exists naturally in at least three different gram-positive genera, indicating that these plasmids have a high degree of interspecific functional adaptability and supporting the view that plasmid dna is commonly exchanged among many species of  gram-positive bacteria in their natural environments.

AB  == the hygienic condition of 6 milking installations, 3 sanitized by circulation cleaning (cc) with chlorine-based chemicals and 3 by flushing with acidified boiling water (abw), was tested using rinses of quarter strength ringer's solution. the bacterial content of the rinses was determined using both colony counts and the direct epifluorescent filter technique (deft). a comparison of testing methods gave correlation coefficients between colony count and deft of 0.82 for plants using cc and 0.46 for plants using abw. five strains of bacteria  belonging to different genera and commonly found on milking equipment were exposed to various degrees of heat and to various concentrations of chlorine. the effects of such treatments on the staining characteristics of the organisms were  studied. it was observed that staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus lactis, although killed by heat treatment, stained a bright orange when treated with acridine orange dye. pseudomonas fluorescens, escherichia coli and vegetative cells of bacillus cereus did not take up the orange stain after heat treatment, nor did any of the 5 strains stain orange after treatment with naocl. it is suggested that the deft is a useful and rapid means of counting bacteria in rinses of equipment where sterilization is due primarily to chlorination, but in  the absence of a stain which can differentiate more accurately between dead and living organisms its use is limited where sterilization is carried out solely by  heat.

TI  == what do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  == beta-lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily  of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which  are primarily cephalosporinases are important. the use of penicillins to treat haemophilus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, salmonella, shigella and pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of  beta-lactamase producing strains. in the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to enterobacter, serratia and bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some pseudomonas and enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. it is only in some streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.

TI  == survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  == lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small  cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of trypan blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. the membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded trypan blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. furthermore, the use of trypan blue uptake as a measure of cell  death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

AB  == pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylanaline cephalosporin (padac), a chromogenic reagent which is purple and changes to yellow upon cleavage of its beta-lactam ring, was  evaluated in comparison with other chromogenic cephalosporins. padac exhibited little antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria, but did have good activity (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml) against staphylococcus aureus, a quality comparable to nitrocefin. nitrocefin, however, demonstrated an unexpected and uniquely potent activity against streptococcus faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration, less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 microgram/ml) the relative hydrolysis rate of padac when subjected to six different beta-lactamases was substantially greater than that of cephacetrile, but less than that of nitrocefin. the relative hydrolysis rates of padac and nitrocefin were comparable with type iiia beta lactamase and the derived from bacillus cereus. the inhibition of beta-lactamase hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin substrates by six enzyme-stable inhibitors was generally greater with padac than with nitrocefin. unlike nitrocefin, padac mixed with 50% human serum or various broth culture media showed no evidence of color change or degradation over several hours. the subsequent enzyme hydrolysis rates of such mixtures were the same as in phosphate buffer. beta-lactamase-containing bacterial suspensions and clinical specimens containing such bacteria produced positive visual and spectrophotometric color changes when mixed with padac or nitrocefin. although color changes occurred more slowly with padac than with nitrocefin, padac was not adversely influenced (non-enzyme-related color change)  by the protein content of specimens. padac appears to be a promising alternative  for beta-lactamase diagnostic testing in the clinical and research microbiology laboratory.

AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

AB  == inclusion of nacl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: staphylococcus aureus (two strains), salmonella senftenberg, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes, c. perfringens (two strains). the magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees  with b. cereus cells. the spores of b. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). the optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 m for the gram-negative organisms to 1.0 m for s. aureus.

TI  == bacterial food-poisoning versus coliforms-faecal streptococci and gamma radiation survival/dose.
AB  == all the species tested were sensitive to gamma radiation treatment, even at a dose as low as 0.001 mrad. the spore-former bacillus cereus (pcj 213) proved to be more resistant than the rest of the tested species, while the gram-negative organisms were more susceptible to irradiation treatment. the tolerance among those organisms is depicted by the descending order: proteus vulgaris, irregular  vi, escherichia coli i, e. coli iii, and salmonella typhi-murium. yet all the tested faecal streptococci species, with the exception of streptococcus bovis, may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between the more resistant b. cereus (pcj 213) and the more sensitive gram-negative organisms.

AB  == in a comparative study the lipoquinones of some chemoorganotrophic, facultatively aerobic bacteria, and representative acholeplasma, mycoplasma, spiroplasma, and thermoplasma strains were investigated. the quinones were partly purified by preparative thin layer chromatography of lipid extracts, and characterized by their difference spectra (reduced minus oxidized) and rf values. respiring bacteria expectedly contained benzoquinones and/or naphthoquinones in micromolar  concentrations whereas some aerotolerant, cytochrome-less, gram-positive bacteria were found to contain menaquinones in nanomolar concentrations, or even no quinones; only streptococcus faecalis, an organism supposed to use a rudimentary, flavin-terminated respiratory chain system produced desmethyl menaquinone in amounts ranging between "high" and "low" quinone contents. among the mycoplasmas  investigated, only thermoplasma acidophilum was found to be capable of synthesizing quinones (mk-7) in the micromolar order of magnitude indicating a respiratory electron transport system. the presence of energetically useful respiratory chain systems in acholeplasma, mycoplasma, and spiroplasma is questioned since these organisms contain quinones (mk-4) in nanomolar concentrations, or no quinones, depending on the presence of exogeneous mk-6 in the growth medium. the possible metabolite role of menaquinones present in "low"  amounts, as well as the role of nadh oxidase systems more or less tightly bound to the cytoplasmic membrane with the mycoplasmas deserves further investigation.

AB  == the activity of phenethyl alcohol (pea) on bacillus cereus, b. megaterium, and streptococcus faecalis was studied by electron microscopy of thin sections and by the assay of intracellular k+ leakage. s. faecalis was unaffected by pea at concentrations up to 0.5%, b. cereus was severely damaged by 0.5% pea, and b. megaterium behaved intermediately. important membrane ultrastructural alterations were observed in b. cereus cells treated with 0.5% pea, namely the change in the  geometry of the membrane profile from asymmetric to symmetric, the occurrence of  prominent, complex mesosome-like structures, and membrane fracturing and solubilization. protoplasts from b. megaterium were found to be quickly lysed by  0.5% pea due to the disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. the electron microscopic observations, together with the results of the study of the k+ efflux from b. cereus and b. megaterium, indicate that pea primarily and directly damages the cytoplasmic membrane of sensitive bacteria. the breakdown of the permeability barrier probably is responsible for the observed bactericidal action of 0.5% pea on b. cereus.

TI  == bacterial mesosomes. real structures or artifacts?
AB  == the ultrastructural study of membrane organization in gram-positive bacteria related to the oso4 fixation conditions revealed that large, complex mesosomes are observed only when the bacteria are subjected to an initial fixation with 0.1%oso4 in the culture broth, as in the prefixation step of the ryter-kellenberger procedure. evidence was obtained suggesting that the large mesosomes are produced by this prefization. the kinetic study of the membrane morphological alterations occurring during the prefixation of bacillus cereus with 0.1%oso4 in the culture broth showed that the amount of mesosome material increases linearly from zero to a maximum observed at 1.7 min of prefixation and  that at about this time a maximum is reached for the number of mesosomes per unity of cell area and for the average individual mesosome area. the large mesosomes observed in gram-positives fixed by the complete ryter-kellenberger procedure would be the result of the membrane-damaging action of 0.1%oso4. such damaging action was deduced from the observation thay 0.1%oso4 quickly lyses protoplasts and induces a quick and extensive leakage of intracellular k+ from b. cereus and streptococcus faecalis. in support of that interpretation is the observation that in bacteria subjected to several membrane-damaging treatments, mesosome-like structures are seen after three different fixation procedures. in bacteria initially fixed with 1% oso4, 4% oso4 or 2.5% glutaraldehyde, no large complex mesosomes are observed, small and simple invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane being present. the size of these minute mesosomes is inversely proportional that causes of fixation. uranyl acetate was found among the studied  fixatives the one to the rate the least damage to bacterial membranes. this fixative satisfactorily preserves protoplasts. in bacteria initially fixed with uranyl acetate no mesosomes were found. the results of the present work throw serious doubts on the existence of mesosomes, both large and small, as real structures of bacterial cells. it is proposed that a continuous cytoplasmic membrane without infoldings (mesosomes) would be the real pattern of membrane organization in gram-positives.

AB  == carbon monoxide formation from heme compounds by bacteria was investigated to study microbial hemoprotein catabolism with reference to heme degradation by mammalian tissues. hemolytic and nonhemolytic bacteria were incubated aerobically and anaerobically with the following substrates: erythrocytes, hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochrome c, hematin, iron hematoporphyrin, copper hematoporphyrin, protoporphyrin, and bilirubin. after 18 hr at 37 c the evolved co was measured by gas chromatography. none of the bacteria formed co anaerobically. under aerobic conditions both alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis and hemolytic bacillus cereus formed co from all of the heme compounds tested, whereas nonhemolytic streptococcus mitis did not evolve co from any of the substrates. the hemolytic bacteria did not produce co when the iron of heme was either replaced by copper or removed, as in copper hematoporphyrin and in protoporphyrin, respectively.

TI  == characteristics of a bacteriocin derived from streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes antagonistic to diplococcus peumoniae.
AB  == a bacteriocin-producing strain of streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes (e-1) was isolated from clinical material (conjunctiva). the active substance differed from bacteriocins described by other investigators primarily in its spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially by its marked inhibition of diplococcus pneumoniae. the e-1 bacteriocin also inhibited nonhemolytic strains of enterococci as well as one-third of the viridans group of streptococcal strains investigated. the degree of inhibition, however, as indicated by the size of the  zones against the latter organisms, was significantly reduced. no activity was detected against any of the strains belonging to the following groups of bacteria: hemolytic enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and various gram-negative species. similarly, three  strains each of bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes and one strain of erysipelothrix insidiosa were not inhibited. the bacteriocin was able to diffuse  through bacterial membranes as well as cellulose dialyzer tubing. it was inactivated by heating to 80 c for 20 min but resisted inactivation by either trypsin or chloroform.

TI  == tetracycline levels in bronchial secretions.
AB  == the excretion of tetracycline hcl in sputum was studied in 42 hospital patients suffering from various respiratory disorders who were receiving oral tetracycline therapy of 1.0 gram daily in divided doses.the tetracycline levels were estimated biologically by a cup-plate agar diffusion method using b. cereus. two separate methods of sputum homogenization are described: enzymic liquefaction with pronase, a powerful proteolytic enzyme, and ultracentrifugation at 103,000 g for  three hours which sediments the viscous mucoids leaving 80-90% as a clear, non-viscous supernatant. the two methods allowed duplicate assays on sputum samples and generally showed close agreement. the ultracentrifugation technique is favoured for normal purposes because of its simplicity and the avoidance of any biochemical interference.a close correlation was shown between the tetracycline levels in sputum samples and the average serum level for each patient. over the serum tetracycline range 1.0-5.0 mug/ml, the mean sputum tetracycline levels after centrifugation were 23-18%, and the average level was 0.50 mug/ml.the levels found in sputum were compared with the minimum inhibitory  concentration of tetracycline for strains of h. influenzae and strep. pneumoniae. eighty-six percent of 29 h. influenzae strains tested and all strep. pneumoniae strains tested were sensitive to 0.5 mug/ml tetracycline. the remaining h. influenzae strains had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 mug/ml or higher, a tetracycline level in sputum which appeared to be outside the mean range at the oral dosage of 1.0 gram daily. hence it is suggested that a small proportion of patients with lower respiratory tract infections due to h. influenzae would be unresponsive, or only partially responsive, to this usual therapeutic range of tetracycline.

TI  == change in the absorbancy of bacterial suspensions before initiation of growth.
AB  == the apparent absorbancy of suspensions of stationary-phase cells of streptococcus lactis strain 354/07 decreased immediately after being placed in fresh media. this optical effect also occurred in defined mixtures of buffer glucose and kcl.  cacl(2) caused the absorbancy to increase. cacl(2) and kcl together had about the same effect as kcl alone. srcl(2) could replace cacl(2), but it was less effective by a factor of 10(2). mncl(2), mgcl(2), and nacl were without effect. the absorbancy did not change when cells were first killed by p-chloromercuribenzoate or when the reaction was carried out at 0 c. the rate of  the reaction was dependent on temperature and concentration of glucose and salts. gradient centrifugation suggests that this optical effect was caused by change in the refractive index of the test organism rather than by change in volume. nine other organisms representing four additional genera gave the same optical effect  as s. lactis 354/07. two other organisms reacted feebly whereas another strain of s. lactis reacted in the opposite way, the absorbancy of the suspension increasing instead of decreasing. spores of bacillus cereus did not respond.

TI  == electron microscopic study of membranes and walls of bacteria and changes occurring during growth initiation.
AB  == thin sections of stationary-phase streptococcus lactis cells showed that the wall and membrane are 20 and 7 nm thick, respectively. whole cells were examined by negative staining with ammonium molybdate and by shadowing. on air-drying of whole cells, the membrane pulled away from the wall revealing adhesions between these organelles. adhesions could not be seen after subculture of the stationary-phase cells into complex media or into solutions containing glucose, kcl, and cacl(2) in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer. the adhesions were also observed in stationary-phase cells of other gram-positive bacteria. fractured freeze-etched cells of s. lactis had a smooth outside surface, but the  inside of the wall (or outside of the membrane) had a regular structure, repeating at 10 nm, which could correspond to the adhesions observed in the negatively stained air-dried cells. freeze-etching also revealed holes in the outside wall which had the shape of inverted truncated cones. the outside diameter of the cone was 60 nm, and the diameter on the inside surface of the wall was 20 nm. the membrane had upstanding plugs, 20 nm in diameter, which could fill the holes in the wall.

TI  == rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  == a gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic  products. the presence of proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, s. liquefaciens, escherichia coli b, bacillus cereus, and b. popilliae was detected  in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7-  to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of serratia marcescens, aerobacter aerogenes, e. coli k-12, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. metabolites elaborated by the  equivalent of less than a single cell of b. cereus, s. faecalis, p. vulgaris, or  e. coli b were sensed by the electron capture detector. the flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

AB  == chorpenning, frank w. (the ohio state university, columbus), and matthew c. dodd. heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria. j. bacteriol. 91:1440-1445. 1966.-soluble antigens obtained by various methods from gram-positive bacteria were used to modify erythrocytes whose hemagglutinating reactions with immune rabbit sera and normal human sera were then studied. antigens from all gram-positive organisms studied except corynbacteria altered red cells, causing them to react with specific bacterial antisera and with normal human sera; however, cross-absorption and inhibition tests indicated that at least three different specificites were involved. one of these antigens seemed to be similar  to rantz's streptococcal nss, which is shared with staphylococcus aureus and bacillus spp., and is therefore heterogenetic. another was found in streptococci  but was apparently not present in s. aureus and bacillus spp. a third antigen, also heterogenetic, appeared to be shared by several species of bacillus and by s. aureus, but not by streptococci or any gram-negative bacteria. the third antigen was heat-stable at ph 8.0, and appeared to be essentially polysaccharide  in nature. normal human sera varied in their content of antibodies which reacted  with erythrocytes modified by extracts from gram-positive bacteria. whereas some  sera reacted very broadly with red cells modified by extracts of practically any  gram-positive organism, other sera agglutinated only cells which had been modified by streptococcal antigen.

TI  == fate of bacteria in chicken meat during freeze-dehydration, rehydration, and storage.
AB  == total plate counts were determined on boneless cooked, cubed chicken meat obtained from a commercial processor. survival of the natural flora was determined after the meat was freeze-dehydrated and rehydrated at room temperature for 30 min and 50, 85, and 100 c for 10 min. total counts of bacteria in the rehydrated samples were determined during storage of the meat at 4, 22, and 37 c until spoilage odor was detectable. meat samples were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, then dried, rehydrated, and stored at the same temperatures. numbers of surviving organisms in the inoculated samples were determined with use of both selective and nonselective media. representative genera surviving the various rehydration treatments were determined. approximately 32% of the bacteria in the meat survived during dehydration and rehydration at room temperature. many numbers and types of vegetative bacteria also survived rehydration at 50 c. when meat was rehydrated at 85 or 100 c, the initial count was less than one per gram. the only organisms isolated from samples rehydrated at 85 or 100 c were of the genus bacillus. s. aureus in inoculated samples survived dehydration and rehydration at 60 c. storage of all rehydrated samples at 4 c gave a good shelf life (18 or more days). the study indicates that freeze-dehydrated meat should be produced with adequate microbiological control and that such meat should be rehydrated in very hot water.

AB  == although lyophilization reduces the bacterial population in plasma, some species  survive for several months. sensitivity or resistance to lyophilization in plasma is a characteristic of each morphological type, with gram-negative species being  more sensitive to destruction than cocci or sporulating gram-positive species. reconstituted preparations of lyophilized plasma must be incubated for 24 hr to prevent false-negative sterility tests. the killing process in lyophilized plasma continues with time if the preparations are stored at room temperature. strict asepsis must be realized during processing of plasma because lyophilization alone does not destroy the microorganisms present.
