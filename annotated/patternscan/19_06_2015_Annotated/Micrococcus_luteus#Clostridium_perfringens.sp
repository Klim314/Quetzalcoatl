TI  == uva-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in dna: a direct photochemical mechanism?
AB  == the carcinogenic action of uva radiation is commonly attributed to dna oxidation  mediated by endogenous photosensitisers. yet, it was recently shown that cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (cpd), well known for their involvement in uvb genotoxicity, are produced in larger yield than oxidative lesions in uva-irradiated cells and skin. in the present work, we gathered mechanistic information on this photoreaction by comparing formation of all possible bipyrimidine photoproducts upon uva irradiation of cells, purified genomic dna and da(20):dt(20) oligonucleotide duplex. we observed that the distribution of photoproducts, characterized by the sole formation of cpd and the absence of (6-4) photoproducts was similar in the three types of samples. the cpd involving  two thymines represented 90% of the amount of photoproducts. moreover, the yields of formation of the dna lesions were similar in cells and isolated dna. in addition, the effect of the wavelength of the incident photons was found to be the same in isolated dna and cells. this set of data shows that uva-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are formed via a direct photochemical mechanism, without mediation of a cellular photosensitiser. this is possible because the double-stranded structure increases the capacity of dna bases to absorb uva photons, as evidenced in the case of the oligomer da(20):dt(20). these results emphasize the need to consider uva in the carcinogenic effects of sunlight. an efficient photoprotection is needed that can only be complete by completely blocking incident photons, rather than by systemic approaches such as antioxidant supplementation.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == improved agar diffusion method for detecting residual antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the improved agar diffusion method for determination of residual antimicrobial agents was investigated, and the sensitivities of various combinations of test organisms and assay media were determined using 7 organisms, 5 media, and 31 antimicrobial agents. bacillus stearothermophilus and synthetic assay medium (sam) showed the greatest sensitivity for screening penicillins (penicillin g and ampicillin). the combination of bacillus subtilis and minimum medium (mm) was the most sensitive for tetracyclines (oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline), b. stearothermophilus and sam or micrococcus luteus and mueller-hinton agar (mha) for detecting tylosin and erythromycin, b. subtilis and mha for aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin), b. stearothermophilus and sam for polyethers (salinomycin and lasalocid), and b. subtilis and mm or clostridium perfringens and gam for polypeptides (thiopeptin,  enramycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin). however, gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli atcc 27166 and mm were better for screening for colistin and polymixin-b. for detecting the synthetic drugs tested, the best combination was b. subtilis and mm for sulfonamides, e. coli 27166 and mm for quinolones (oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid), b. subtilis and mm for furans (furazolidone), and the bioluminescent bacterium photobacterium phosphoreum and luminescence assay medium for chloramphenicol and oxolinic acid. the results showed that the use of four assay plates, b. stearothermophilus and sam, b. subtilis and mm, m. luteus and mha, and e. coli 27166 and mm, was superior to the currently available techniques for screening for residual antimicrobial agents in edible animal tissues.

TI  == structural basis of polyamine-dna recognition: spermidine and spermine interactions with genomic b-dnas of different gc content probed by raman spectroscopy.
AB  == four genomic dnas of differing gc content (micrococcus luteus, 72% gc; escherichia coli, 50% gc; calf thymus, 42% gc; clostridium perfringens, 27% gc) have been employed as targets of interaction by the cationic polyamines spermidine ([h(3)n(ch(2))(3)nh(2)(ch(2))(4)nh(3)](3+)) and spermine ([(ch(2))(4)(nh(2)(ch(2))(3)nh(3))(2)](4+)). in solutions containing 60 mm dna phosphate (approximately 20 mg dna/ml) and either 1, 5 or 60 mm polyamine, only raman bands associated with the phosphates exhibit large spectral changes, demonstrating that b-dna phosphates are the primary targets of interaction. phosphate perturbations, which are independent of base composition, are consistent with a model of non-specific cation binding in which delocalized polyamines diffuse along dna while confined by the strong electrostatic potential gradient perpendicular to the helix axis. this finding provides experimental support for models in which polyamine-induced dna condensation is driven by non-specific electrostatic binding. the raman spectra also demonstrate that major groove sites (guanine n7 and thymine c5h(3)) are less affected than phosphates by polyamine-dna interactions. modest dependence of polyamine binding on genome base composition suggests that sequence context plays only a secondary role in recognition. importantly, the results demonstrate that polyamine binding has a negligible effect on the native b-form secondary structure. the capability of spermidine or spermine to bind and condense genomic b-dna without disrupting the  native structure must be taken into account when considering dna organization within bacterial nucleoids or cell nuclei.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aristolochia paucinervis pomel.
AB  == several fractions of the methanolic extract of the rhizome or the leaves of aristolochia paucinervis pomel were screened for antibacterial activity using the agar dilution method against fourteen reference bacterial strains. only three fractions (defatted chloroformic rhizome fraction: aprc, rhizome ethyl acetate fraction: apre and leaf chloroform fraction: aplc) showed an activity against at  least one of the microorganisms tested. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination showed that aprc was the most active against clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis. the high bacteriostatic activity of aprc was confirmed by its  mic determination against clinical strains of c. perfringens (n = 32), c. difficile (n = 31), and e. faecalis (n = 22). results of this study suggest the potential interest of this highly active fraction and support the use of a. paucinervis pomel in moroccan traditional medicine to treat skin and soft-tissue  infections, especially gas gangrene and intestinal diseases.

TI  == dependence of the raman signature of genomic b-dna on nucleotide base sequence.
AB  == the vibrational spectra of four genomic and two synthetic dnas, encompassing a wide range in base composition [poly(da-dt). poly(da-dt), 0% g + c; clostridium perfringens dna, 27% g + c; calf thymus dna, 42% g + c; escherichia coli dna, 50% g + c; micrococcus luteus dna, 72% g + c; poly(dg-dc).poly(dg-dc), 100% g + c] (da: deoxyadenosine; dg: deoxyguanosine; dc: deoxycytidine; dt: thymidine), have  been analyzed using raman difference methods of high sensitivity. the results show that the raman signature of b dna depends in detail upon both genomic base composition and sequence. raman bands assigned to vibrational modes of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone are among the most sensitive to base sequence, indicating that within the b family of conformations major differences occur in the backbone geometry of at- and gc-rich domains. raman bands assigned to in-plane vibrations of the purine and pyrimidine bases-particularly of a and t-exhibit large deviations from the patterns expected for random base distributions, establishing that raman hypochromic effects in genomic dna are also highly sequence dependent. the present study provides a basis for future use of raman spectroscopy to analyze sequence-specific dna-ligand interactions. the demonstration of sequence dependency in the raman spectrum of genomic b dna also  implies the capability to distinguish genomic dnas by means of their characteristic raman signatures.

TI  == the enzymatic activity of phosphoglycerate mutase from gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria requires mn2+ and is ph sensitive.
AB  == the enzymatic activity of phosphoglycerate mutase (pgm) from three gram-positive  endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, and sporosarcina ureae) requires mn2+ and is very sensitive to ph; at low concentrations of mn2+, a ph change from 8 to 6 resulted in greater than 30- to 200-fold decreases in the activity of these pgms. however, pgm deactivation at ph 6 was reversed by shifting the enzyme to ph 7 or 8. free mn2+ was not directly involved in pgm catalysis, although enzyme-bound mn2+ may be involved. the rate of catalysis by mn(2+)-containing pgm was also slightly ph dependent, although the km for 3-phosphoglyceric acid appeared to be the same at ph 6, 7, and 8. these findings suggest that mn2+ binds to catalytically inactive pgm and converts it to a catalytically competent form, and further, that ph influences the efficiency with which the enzyme binds mn2+. the extreme ph sensitivity of the mn(2+)-dependent pgms supports a model in which this enzyme is inhibited during sporulation by acidification of the forespore, thus allowing accumulation of the  spore's large depot of 3-phosphoglyceric acid. the activity of pgm from two closely related gram-positive bacteria that do not form spores (planococcus citreus and staphylococcus saprophyticus) also requires mn2+ and is ph sensitive. in contrast, the pgm activities from two more distantly related non-endospore-forming gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus and streptomyces coelicolor) are neither dependent on metal ions nor particularly sensitive to ph.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == restriction generated oligonucleotides utilizing the two base recognition endonuclease cviji*.
AB  == the conversion of an anonymous dna sample into numerous oligonucleotides is enzymatically feasible using an unusual restriction endonuclease, cviji. depending on reaction conditions, cviji is capable of digesting dna at a two or three base recognition sequence. cviji normally cleaves rgcy sites between the g  and c to leave blunt ends. under 'relaxed' conditions cviji* cleaves rgcy, and rgcr/ygcy, but not ygcr sites. in theory, cviji* restriction of puc19 (2686 bp) should produce 157 fragments, 75% of which are smaller than 20 bp. instead, 96% of the cviji* fragments were 18-56 bp long and none of the fragments were smaller than 18 bp. thermal denaturation of these fragments generates sequence specific oligonucleotides homologous for the cognate template. the enzymatic conversion of anonymous dna into sequence specific oligomers has implications for several conventional and novel molecular biology procedures.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == flow dichroism evidence for tilting of the bases when dna is in solution.
AB  == flow linear dichroism studies of dnas from clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and micrococcus luteus are extended into the vacuum uv region to 175 nm. the short-wavelength pi pi region shows a less negative reduced linear dichroism  than the well-studied long-wavelength pi pi region. these results are independent of the type of dna and the concentration of salt over the range 0.001 to 1.0 m. this proves that the bases are not perpendicular to the flow orientation. assuming that the dna tends to align along its helix axis, the largest angle that the bases can make with the helix axis is 73 +/- 3 degrees.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid binding studies on several new anthracycline antitumor antibiotics. sequence preference and structure--activity relationships of marcellomycin and its analogues as compared to adriamycin.
AB  == the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) binding characteristics of adriamycin and several new anthracycline glycosides, including marcellomycin, aclacinomycin, rudolfomycin, musettamycin, and pyrromycin, have been studied. the fluorescence spectra were determined for all six anthracyclines, and the fluorescence quenching effects caused by interactions with the natural dnas poly(dadt)--poly(dadt) and poly(dgdc) were characterized. binding parameters were determined by scatchard analyses of results obtained by spectrofluorometric titrations of anthracyclines with dna. consistent with earlier structure--activity relationship studies of nucleic acid synthesis inhibitory effects, the results demonstrate a correlation between the length of the glycosidic side chain and dna binding affinity. in addition, the sugar residue 2-deoxyfucose appears to confer greater dna binding ability than do the sugars rednosamine and cinerulose when present in the terminal position of the glycosidic side chain, also in agreement with earlier studies. the sequence preference of anthracycline--dna interaction has been examined by using dnas of varying gc content, including the naturally occurring calf thymus dna (43% gc), clostridium perfringens dna (28% gc), and micrococcus luteus dna (72% gc) and the synthetic double-stranded copolymers poly(dgdc)--poly(dgdc) and poly(dadt)--poly(dadt). the results demonstrate that although adriamycin shows an absolute requirement for gc sequences for dna binding, marcellomycin and its analogues showed no such sequence requirement. furthermore, an at preference for  dna binding was demonstrated with marcellomycin and its analogues.

TI  == core nucleosomes by digestion of reconstructed histone-dna complexes.
AB  == reconstructed complexes of the inner histones (h2a, h2b, h3, h4) and a variety of dnas were digested with micrococcal nuclease to yield very homogeneous populations of core nucleosomes (nu 1). nucleosomes containing micrococcus luteus dna (72% g+c); chicken dna (43% g+c), clostridium perfringens dna (29% g+c); or poly(a-dt.poly(da-dt) have been examined by circular dichroism, thermaldetenaturation, electron microscopy, and dnase i digestion. circular dichroism spectra of all particles show a typically suppressed ellipticity at 260--280 nm and a prominent alpha-helix signal at 222 nm. all particles show biphasic melting except nu 1 (da-dt), which show three prominent melting transitions at ionic strength less than or equal to 1 mm. dnase i digestion of nu 1 (da-dt) produces a ladder of dna fragments fiffering in lengthy by one base residue. nu 1 (da-dt) contain 146 base pairs of dna and exhibit an average dna helix pitch of 10.4-10.5 bases per turn. there appear to be two regions of different dna pitch wihtin nu 1 (da-dt). it is suggested that the two regions of  dna pitch might correspond to the two regions of the melting profiles.

TI  == histone redistribution and conformational effect on chromatin induced by formaldehyde.
AB  == histone redistributions between endogenous dna in calf thymus chromatin and exogenous dna from clostridium perfringens (69% a + t) or from micrococcus luteus (30% a + t) induced by 0.6 m nacl or by 2% formaldehyde were studied by thermal denaturation. the observed redistribution occurred on histone hl when the exogenous dna was (a + t)-richer than the dna in chromatin, and when the mixture  was exposed to 0.6 m nacl or formaldehyde. when a (g + c)-richer dna was added as the acceptor for histones, no substantial transfer of histones from chromatin dna to exogenous dna was found. thus the activation energy of histone dissociation from chromatin dna seems to be substantially lowered by 0.6 m nacl or formaldehyde such that histones (mostly histone hl) can be dissociated and bind the (a + t)-richer dna and form a more stable complex. it is suggested that the formaldehyde effect on histones may be due to the loss of positive charges on lysine and arginin residues (probably more on lysine than on arginine) in histones after their rapid reaction with formaldehyde. formaldehyde treatment of  chromatin also distorts the dna conformation, as revealed by circular dichroism (cd) studies. this structural effect occurs mainly on those base pairs bound by histones other than hl, or within the chromatin subunit. histone redistribution is treated as a thermodynamic phenomenon of histone binding to dna. the validity  of using formaldehyde to study chromatin structure is discussed.

TI  == competitive inhibition of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis  by heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  == glucosylated deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) from phages t4 and t6 competes poorly with homologous dna causing only a slight decrease of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis. other types of heterologous dnas (micrococcus luteus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, calf thymus and non-glucosylated phage t6 dna), in contrast to glucosylated t4 and t6 dnas, compete with transforming dna to the normal, high extent. these results indicate  that as in transformation of bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached  to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in phage t6 dna considerably decreases the interaction of such dna with competent cells of the challis strain. it also indicates that the guanine plus cytosine content of dna is not decisive in determining its interaction with competent cells.

TI  == studies on interaction between histone v (f2c) and deoxyribonucleic acids.
AB  == histone v (2fc) from chick erythroctes was used in the study of its interaction with dna from various sources. complexes between this histone and dna were formed using the procedure of continuous nacl gradient dialysis in urea. two physical methods, namely thermal denaturation and circular dichroism (cd), were used as analytical tools. thermal denaturation of nucleohistone v with chick or calf thymus dna shows three melting bands: band i at 45-50 degrees corresponds to free base pairs; band ii at 75-79 degrees, and band iii at 90-93 degrees correspond to histone-bound base pairs. in histone-bound regions, there are 1.5 amino acid residues/nucleotide in nucleohistone v. in contrast, a value between 2.9 and 3.3  was determined for nucleohistone i (fl) (h. j. li (1973), biopolymers 12, 287). similar melting properties have been observed for histone v complexed with bacterial dna from micrococcus luteus. histone v binding to dna induces a slight  transition from a b-type cd spectrum to a c-type spectrum. trypsin treatment of nucleohistone v reduces melting band iii much more effectively than band ii. such a treatment also restores dna to b conformation in the free state. reduction of the melting bands of nucleohistone v by polylysine binding follows the order of i greater than ii greater than iii, accompanied by the increase of a new band at 100 degrees. when two bacterial dnas of varied a + t (adenine + thymine) content  simultaneously compete for the binding of histone v, the more (a " t)-rich dna is selectively favored. under experimental conditions described here, clostridium perfringens dna with 69% a + t is bound by histone v in preference to chicken dna with 56% a + t although the latter has natural sequences for histone v binding.

TI  == interaction of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein with dnas of different base composition.
AB  == the changes in absorption spectra in the visible region observed on adding different naturally occurring and synthetic dna duplexes to solutions of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein indicate that the mercurial reacts with polynucleotides of this type. the reaction is reversible as proved by adding excess of kcn which restores the original spectra of the free dye. the interaction is characterised also by quenching of the fluorescence of the dye and the induction of optical activity in it. the extent of these spectral effects depends strongly on the (a+t) content of the complexed dna and decreased in the order: poly [d(a-t)], clostridium perfringens dan, escherichia coli dna, micrococcus luteus dna and poly(dc). from equilibrium-dialysis experiments the same order in affinity is obtained when these poly-nucleotides are at equilibrium with the same concentration of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein. from the changes produced by different mercurials in the ord spectra and viscosity of a dna solution it has been concluded that 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein does not cause any drastic alteration of the secondary structure of dna.
