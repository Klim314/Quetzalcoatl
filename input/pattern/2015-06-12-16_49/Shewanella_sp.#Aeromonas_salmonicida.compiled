TI  - Histamine-producing bacteria in blue scad (Decapterus maruadsi) and their abilities to produce histamine and other biogenic amines.
AB  - Using decarboxylation medium and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, histamine-producing  bacteria (HPB) in blue scad (Decapterus maruadsi) were isolated and identified, and the histamine-producing abilities of the isolated HPB were determined. Nine mesophilic strains (H1-H9) isolated from the muscle of blue scad were identified as the genera of HPB, including Arthrobacter bergeri (H1), Pseudomonas sp. (H2, H5 and H6), Psychrobacter sp. (H3), Shewanella baltica (H4 and H7), and Aeromonas salmonicida (H8 and H9), respectively. Results showed that most of the HPB strains were weak on histamine formation (13.0-20.4 mg/l), except for the H8 strain with the ability of producing 115 mg of histamine/l in trypticase soy broth containing 1.0 % L-histidine. As the strongest HPB in blue scad, bacterial strain H8 also presented a strong ability to produce other biogenic amines, such as putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, spermine, tyramine and tryptamine. Therefore, the H8 strain identified as the genus of A. salmonicida was the dominant mesophilic HPB strain for producing histamine and other biogenic amines in blue scad at room temperature.
TI  - Evaluation of the spoilage potential of bacteria isolated from spoiled cooked whole tropical shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) stored under modified atmosphere packaging.
AB  - The spoilage potential of isolates belonging to five bacterial groups/species (Shewanella baltica, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio sp., "other Gamma-Proteobacteria" [containing one strain of Pseudoalteromonas sp. and one strain of Psychrobacter sp.]) isolated from spoiled cooked and whole tropical shrimp stored under modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) was evaluated by inoculation into ionized cooked and peeled tropical shrimp followed by storage for 32 days at 8 degrees C. Microbial growth and sensory changes were monitored during the storage period. The major spoilage bacterial isolate groups were C. maltaromaticum and S. baltica. In order to characterize their spoilage potential further and to study the effect of their interactions, each of these two specific spoilage organisms (SSO) and one mixed-culture, C. maltaromaticum/S. baltica, were tested using a combination of complementary methods: molecular (PCR-TTGE), sensory, chemical, and conventional microbiological analyses. It was concluded that, in the mixed-culture-inoculated samples, both species groups imposed their spoilage characteristics.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - Curvularia haloperoxidase: antimicrobial activity and potential application as a  surface disinfectant.
AB  - A presumed antimicrobial enzyme system, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, was examined with the aim of evaluating its potential as a sanitizing agent. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Curvularia haloperoxidase facilitates the oxidation of halides, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, to antimicrobial compounds. The Curvularia haloperoxidase system caused several-log-unit reductions in counts of bacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas salmonicida, Shewanella putrefaciens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Candida sp. and Rhodotorula sp.), and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tubigensis, Aspergillus versicolor, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Penicillium paxilli) cultured in suspension. Also, bacteria adhering to the surfaces of contact lenses were killed. The numbers of S. marcescens and S. epidermidis cells adhering to contact lenses were reduced from 4.0 and 4.9 log CFU to 1.2 and 2.7 log CFU, respectively, after treatment with the Curvularia haloperoxidase system. The killing effect of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system was rapid, and 10(6) CFU of E. coli cells/ml were eliminated within 10 min of treatment. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect was short lived, causing no antibacterial effect against E. coli 10 min after the system was mixed. Bovine serum albumin (1%) and alginate (1%) inhibited the antimicrobial activity of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, whereas glucose and Tween 20 did not affect its activity. In conclusion, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system is an effective sanitizing system and has the potential for a vast range of applications, for instance, for disinfection of contact lenses or medical devices.
TI  - Sialic acid-binding lectin with antibacterial activity from the horse mussel: further characterization and immunolocalization.
AB  - A heterogeneous sialic acid-binding lectin with affinity for bacterial LPS was isolated and partially characterized from hemolymph of the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus.(1) Using two-dimensional electrophoresis with immobilized pH gradients, the lectin revealed three subunits with different molecular weight and isoelectric points (pI); Mr14 (pI approximately 5.1 and approximately 5.5), 17.5 (pI approximately 5.5) and 20 (pI approximately 4.9) kDa. The affinity purified lectin existed in its native state as aggregates, and by stepwise centrifugation it could be fractionated into molecular entities with distinct specificities towards human and/or horse erythrocytes (modiolin H and/or E activity, respectively). While the medium size entities (range < or = 30 and < 100 kDa) exhibited only modiolin E activity and the lowest size entities (range < or = 5 and < 10 kDa) demonstrated only modiolin H activity, the largest aggregates (> or = 100 kDa-)expressed both activities. Antibacterial activity of the lectin has been observed against various marine bacteria, whereas the whole hemolymph was less effective. The lectin exhibited strong antibacterial effect against all tested strains of Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio salmonicida, Vibrio viscosus, Vibrio wodanis, and Vibrio ordalii, slight effect on Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida and Shewanella putrefaciens, and no inhibitory effect with Alteromonas sp. Hemolymph of the horse mussel demonstrated no antibacterial effect against A. salmonicida salmonicida, Alteromonas sp., Sh. putrefaciens and some strains of V. anguillarum, but slight effects against some strains of V. anguillarum and both strains of V. ordalii, and more predominantly against V. wodanis, V. salmonicida and V. viscosus. These results indicate that the lectin plays a role in elimination of bacteria. Circulating hemocytes were demonstrated to be the source of the lectins since granules of the hemocytes were immunoreactive to anti-hemolymph lectin antibody and protein A/gold labelling.
