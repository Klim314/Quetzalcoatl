TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16S ribosomal DNA bacterial genes from DNA isolated from advanced noma lesions of four Nigerian children were PCR amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. Partial 16S rRNA sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. A total of 67 bacterial species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. Nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. Other known species that were detected included Achromobacter spp., Afipia spp., Brevundimonas diminuta, Capnocytophaga spp., Cardiobacterium sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., Gemella haemoylsans, and Neisseria spp. Phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera Eubacterium, Flavobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, and Porphyromonas and the related Streptococcus salivarius and genera Sphingomonas and TREPONEMA: Since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. Several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and Fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. However, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
