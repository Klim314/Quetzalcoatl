TI  == oropharyngeal colonization with neisseria lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria species and moraxella catarrhalis among young healthy children in ahvaz, iran.
AB  == background: neisseria lactamica as one of the main commensal in oropharynx during the childhood is related to the induction of a natural immunity against meningococcal meningitis. also moraxella catarrhalis in oropharynx of children is a predisposing factor for otitis media infection. objectives: the current study aimed to investigate the frequency of the n. lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. and m. catarrhalis in the oropharynx of young healthy children in  ahvaz, iran by the two phenotypic tests and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: a total of 192 oropharyngeal swab samples of the young healthy children were studied during four months. swabs were plated onto enriched selective media and non-selective media. gram-negative and oxidase-positive diplococci were identified by several conventional biochemical tests. the pcr and sequencing were used to confirm the accuracy of laboratory diagnosis to identify  n. lactamica and m. catarrhalis. results: among 192 young healthy children with the mean age of 5.93 +/- 2.5903 years, authors identified: n. lactamica (21.9%) in the age group of one to nine years; n. mucosa (6.3%); n. sicca (7.8%); n. cinerea (1.6%); n. subflava (biovar subflava) (4.2%); n. subflava (biovar perflava) (28.1%); n. subflava (biovar flava) (7.3%) and m. catarrhalis (42.7%).  conclusions: the young healthy children screening by colonization of n. lactamica and other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. in oropharynx was the first report in ahvaz, iran. the study results demonstrated the high frequency of colonization of m. catarrhalis in the studied young healthy children other than neisseria spp.

TI  == [gene detection of neisseria spp. isolated from male patients with genitourinary  tract infections].
AB  == objective: to detect the genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, and to study the pathogenicity of non-gonococcal  strains of neisseria and the laboratory diagnosis for the infections caused by neisseria spp. methods: using polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing, we amplified and sequenced 4 genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, including 16s rrna, orfl, cppb and nspa. results: fourteen neisseria strains were identified through analysis of the 16s rrna gene, including 3 n. mucosa strains, 3 n. cinerea strains, 2 n. gonorrhoea strains, 2 n. sicca strains, 2 n. subflava strains, 1 n. lactamica strain, and 1 n. polysaccharea strain. among them, 9 showed positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, 1 in cppb gene reaction, 5 in orfl gene reaction, and 3 in nspa gene reaction. the consistency rate was 85.7% between the above results from our gene detection and those from the routine bacteriological methods. conclusion: the cppb gene is absent in the non-gonococcal strains of neisseria spp. that can cause male genitourinary tract  infection. most of the strains not only lack virulence-associated orfl and nspa genes, but also show positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, which is one of the important reasons for the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. the combination of routine bacteriological methods and gene detection in laboratory examinations may help improve the accuracy rates of neisseria species identification and clinical  diagnosis of the infections caused by neisseria spp.

TI  == biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  neisseria.
AB  == since neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. the recent completion of commensal neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. all species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (norb) and a nitrite  reductase (ania or nirk) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the n-terminal lipid modification and c-terminal glycosylation domains. only neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (nar), and only neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea, neisseria subflava, neisseria flavescens and neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (nos) complex. the regulators of the denitrification genes, fnr, narqp and nsrr, were highly conserved, except  for the gaf domain of narq. biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except n. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than n. gonorrhoeae, while n. meningitidis and most of the commensal neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (no) reductase activity. for n. meningitidis and most of the  commensal neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the no steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with n. gonorrhoeae. all of the species tested generated an no steady-state level in the presence of an no donor that was similar to that of n. gonorrhoeae. the greatest difference between the neisseria species was the lack of a functional nos system in the pathogenic species n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis.

TI  == analysis of amino acid sequences of penicillin-binding protein 2 in clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefixime of 0.125-0.25 microg/ml and ceftriaxone of 0.031-0.125 microg/ml, were isolated from male urethritis patients in tokyo, japan, in 2006. the amino acid sequences of pena, penicillin-binding protein 2, in these strains were of two types: pena mosaic and nonmosaic strains. in the pena mosaic strain, some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in pena were similar to those of neisseria perflava/sicca, neisseria cinerea, neisseria flavescens, neisseria polysaccharea, and neisseria meningitidis. in the pena nonmosaic strain, there was a mutation of ala-501 to val in pena. in addition, we performed homology modeling of pena wild-type and mosaic strains and compared them. the results of the modeling studies suggested that reduced susceptibility to cephems such as cefixime and ceftriaxone is due to a conformational alteration of the beta-lactam-binding pocket. these results also indicated that the mosaic structures and the above point mutation in pena make a major contribution to the reduced susceptibility to cephem antibiotics.

TI  == distribution of transferrin binding protein b gene (tbpb) variants among neisseria species.
AB  == background: transferrin binding protein b (tbpb), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. two tbpb families have been documented in neisseria meningitidis: an isotype i tbpb gene of 1.8 kb  and an isotype ii tbpb gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated st-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including st-8, st-18, st-32, st-41/44 as well as n. gonorrhoeae isolates. the origin of the isotype i tbpb gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic neisseria and the st-11 clonal complex n. meningitidis isolate fam18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype i tbpb gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic neisseria and st-11 meningococci. as a  result, the diversity of the tbpb gene was investigated in a defined collection of neisseria species. results: two families of isotype i tbpb were identified: family a containing conserved genes belonging to st-11 meningococci, n. polysaccharea and n. lactamica isolates and family b including more diverse isotype i tbpb genes from n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. subflava as well as n. cinerea, n. flavescens and n. polysaccharea isolates. three isotype ii tbpb families were identified with: family c containing diverse tbpb genes belonging to n. polysaccharea, n. lactamica, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis isolates, family d including another subset of isotype ii tbpb genes from n. lactamica isolates and family e solely composed of n. gonorrhoeae tbpb genes. conclusion: this study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the st-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic neisseria with the origin of the isotype  i tbpb gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between  these two populations.

TI  == variations in gene organization and dna uptake signal sequence in the folp region between commensal and pathogenic neisseria species.
AB  == background: horizontal gene transfer is an important source of genetic variation  among neisseria species and has contributed to the spread of resistance to penicillin and sulfonamide drugs in the pathogen neisseria meningitidis. sulfonamide resistance in neisseria meningitidis is mediated by altered chromosomal folp genes. at least some folp alleles conferring resistance have been horizontally acquired from other species, presumably from commensal neisseriae. in this work, the dna sequence surrounding folp in commensal neisseria species was determined and compared to corresponding regions in pathogenic neisseriae, in order to elucidate the potential for inter-species dna  transfer within this region. results: the upstream region of folp displayed differences in gene order between species, including an insertion of a complete correia element in neisseria lactamica and an inversion of a larger genomic segment in neisseria sicca, neisseria subflava and neisseria mucosa. the latter species also had dna uptake signal sequences (dus) in this region that were one base different from the dus in pathogenic neisseriae. another interesting finding was evidence of a horizontal transfer event from neisseria lactamica or neisseria cinerea that introduced a novel folp allele to the meningococcal population. conclusion: genetic recombination events immediately upstream of folp and horizontal transfer have resulted in sequence differences in the folp region between the neisseria species. this variability could be a consequence of the selective pressure on this region exerted by the use of sulfonamide drugs.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == serotype distribution, antibiotic susceptibility, and genetic relatedness of neisseria meningitidis strains recently isolated in italy.
AB  == the availability of new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines against neisseria meningitidis serogroup c prompted european national health authorities  to carefully monitor isolate characteristics. in italy, during 1999-2001, the average incidence was 0.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. serogroup b was predominant and accounted for 75% of the isolates, followed by serogroup c with 24%. serogroup c was isolated almost twice as frequently in cases of septicemia than in cases of meningitis, and the most common phenotypes were c:2a:p1.5 and c:2b:p1.5. among serogroup b meningococci, the trend of predominant phenotypes has changed from year to year, with a recent increase in the frequency of b:15:p1.4. only a few meningococci had decreased susceptibility to penicillin, and, in the pena gene, all of these strains had exogenous dna blocks deriving from the dna of commensal neisseria flavescens, neisseria cinerea, and neisseria  perflava/sicca. fluorescent amplified fragment-length polymorphism analysis revealed the nonclonal nature of the strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin.

TI  == mosaic-like structure of penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) in clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mics, 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) were isolated from male urethritis patients in tokyo, japan, in 2000 and 2001. the resistance to cephems including cefixime and penicillin was transferred to a susceptible recipient, n. gonorrhoeae atcc 19424, by transformation of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) that had been amplified by pcr from a strain with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mic, 0.5  micro g/ml). the sequences of pena in the strains with reduced susceptibilities to cefixime were different from those of other susceptible isolates and did not correspond to the reported n. gonorrhoeae pena gene sequences. some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in this pena gene were similar to those in the pena genes of neisseria perflava (n. sicca), neisseria cinerea, neisseria flavescens, and neisseria meningitidis. these results showed that a mosaic-like structure in the pena gene conferred reductions in the levels of susceptibility of n. gonorrhoeae to cephems and penicillin in a manner similar to that found for n. meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == characterization of the ftsz cell division gene of neisseria gonorrhoeae: expression in escherichia coli and n. gonorrhoeae.
AB  == we cloned the cell division gene ftsz of the gram-negative coccus neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) strain ch811, characterized it genetically and phenotypically, and studied its localization in n. gonorrhoeae and escherichia coli (ec). the 1,179-bp orf of ftsz(ng) encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 41.5 kda. protein sequence alignments indicate that ftsz(ng) is similar to other  ftsz proteins and contains the conserved gtp binding motif. ftsz homologues were  identified in several n. gonorrhoeae strains and in neisseria lactamica, neisseria sicca, neisseria polysaccharae and neisseria cinerea either by western  blot or by pcr-southern blot analysis. attempts to inactivate the ftsz(ng) on the chromosome failed, indicating that it is essential for gonococcal growth. ftsz(ng) was synthesized in an in vitro transcription/translation system and was  shown to be 43 kda, the same size as in western blots. expression of the ftsz(ng) gene from nongonococcal promoters resulted in a filamentous phenotype in e. coli. under controlled expression, the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein localized at the mid-cell division site in e. coli. e. coli expressing high levels of the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein formed filaments and exhibited different fluorescent  structures including helices, spiral tubules extending from pole to pole, and regularly spaced dots or bands that did not localize at the middle of the cell. expression of the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein in n. gonorrhoeae resulted in abnormal cell division as shown by electron microscopy. ftsz(ng)-gfp fusions were also expressed in a gonococcal background using a unique shuttle vector.

TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae : detection and typing by probe hybridization, lcr, and pcr.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by neisser in 1879, is a gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family neisseriaceae. it is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. the other pathogenic species is neisseria meningitidis, to which n. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. although n. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). the other members of the genus, which include neisseria lactamic a, neisseriapolysaccharea, neisseria cinerea, and neisseria flavescens, which are related to neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as neisseria subflava, neisseria sicca, and neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).

TI  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of the genus neisseria.
AB  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. these fell into four major areas. areas a, b and c contained species of neisseria, whereas area d contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with branhamella, moraxella and kingella species. area a contained n. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), n. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and n. cinerea closely associated), n. polysaccharea, n. elongata subsp, glycolytica and n. lactamica. area b contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, n. mucosa, n. perflava and n. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. area c contained several groups from animals, n. animalis, n. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. area c also contained n.  elongata, n. subflava (with n. flavescens), type strain of morococcus cerebrosis  and the cdc groups m-5 (n. weaveri) and ef-4. area d contained branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' n. caviae and n. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' n. ovis, and a group of moraxella strains. a small group representing kingella kingae is included in area d. mean test error was 1.7%.

TI  == detection of the tetm determinant in neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  == three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetm sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the dig-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae. only probe 3, 5'-gct caa caa ttc tgt tcc agc-3', was specific for tetm. it hybridized with the tetm-containing 25.2-mda plasmids from  all of the 232 trng and the 130 pp/trng isolates used in the study. its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pj13 plasmid dna or 10(4) cells. it did not hybridize with the dna from non-ppng, cmrng and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other neisseria species (n. meningitidis, n. subflava, n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. sicca, n. mucosa, and n.  flavescens), moraxella spp. and haemophilus influenzae. probe 3 also hybridized to dna of three tetracycline resistant p. magnus (mic = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetm determinant. therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for trng, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetm determinant.

TI  == genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal neisseria.
AB  == the pathogenic neisseria and most commensal neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. in the current study, we confirmed the presence of fbp, as well as dna sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of n. gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis,  n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. subflava, n. kochii and n. polysaccharea. the fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with stui or rsai, and the restriction patterns examined. the patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal neisseria species. n. flavescens, n. mucosa, n. sicca, n. ovis and branhamella catarrhalis, did not  produce fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did  they hybridize to an fbp-specific dna probe.

TI  == distribution of a protein antigenically related to the major anaerobically induced gonococcal outer membrane protein among other neisseria species.
AB  == the pan 1 protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae is a novel 54-kda outer membrane protein expressed only when gonococci are grown in the absence of oxygen. it is a major antigen recognized by sera from patients with gonococcal infection. we raised mouse monospecific polyclonal antiserum to gel-purified pan 1 from gonococcal strain f62. the antiserum was broadly cross-reactive among gonococcal  strains; all strains tested reacted in immunoblot analysis proportionate to the amount of pan 1 visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gels. in immunoblot experiments, n. lactamica and n. cinerea reacted very strongly to the anti-pan 1 antiserum, whereas n. sicca, n. flava, and n. mucosa did not react at all. the other commensals tested, n. subflava and  n. perflava, exhibited only a minor reaction. these results correlated with the apparent amount of pan 1 seen on sds-polyacrylamide gels of outer membranes. sds-polyacrylamide gel analysis of six meningococcal strains revealed no visible  anaerobically induced outer membrane proteins, and the subsequent immunoblots showed only slight or no reaction to the anti-pan 1 antibody. in the four meningococcal strains that did react slightly with the antiserum, a pan 1-like protein was seen only in anaerobically grown cells. thus, meningococci did not express pan 1 at levels comparable to that found in gonococci; however, when pan  1 was expressed in meningococcal strains, it was oxygen regulated. this is the first example of a protein found in the gonococcal outer membrane that, under identical growth conditions, is not expressed at similar levels in the meningococcus.

TI  == conjugation of plasmids of neisseria gonorrhoeae to other neisseria species: potential reservoirs for the beta-lactamase plasmid.
AB  == the discovery that penicillinase production in neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. we initiated studies to  define the ability of commensal neisseria species and branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with neisseria gonorrhoeae. we found that with n. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 neisseria flava, 0 of  1 neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 b. catarrhalis, 0 of 7  neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 n. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). n. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (ple2451). a n. cinerea transconjugant containing ple2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and ple2451 to n. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.

TI  == cellular monosaccharide patterns of neisseriaceae.
AB  == sixty-four strains of neisseria, moraxella, and acinetobacter were screened for cellular monosaccharides by gas-liquid chromatography and other chromatographic techniques. the four sugars ribose, glucose, glucosamine, and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (kdo) were detected in all strains. heptose was detected only in "true neisseriae" (neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, n. sicca, n. cinerea, n. flavescens, and n. elongata) and in the tentaively named species moraxella urethralis. some marked interspecies dissimilarities within groups were revealed. thus, n. ovis and m. atlantae were characterized by the presence of mannose. intraspecies differences were also encountered. n. meningitidis strains  of serogroups b and c were distinguished from strains of serogroup a by their sialic acid content. this sugar was also detected in two out of three examined strains of m. nonliquefaciens. in acinetobacter, heterogeneity of monosaccharide  patterns was rather pronounced. the results show the applicability of gas chromatographic "monosaccharide" profiles fo whole cells or extracted carbohydrate in bacterial classification and identification, including differentiation at the subspecies level. in addition, such profiles may be useful for monitoring during purification of cellular polysaccharides.

TI  == cellular and free lipopolysaccharides of some species of neisseria.
AB  == cultures of eight non-pathogenic species of neisseria grown in simple defined media released lipopolysaccharide (free lipopolysaccharide) by a process distinct from cellular autolysis. analyses of the pure cellular and free lipopolysaccharides obtained from six species of neisseria revealed that they were remarkably similar and were devoid of detectable o-antigen side chains. three distinct types of core-oligosaccharides were demonstrated. type i core-oligosaccharide was a branched structure of alpha-d-glucopyranosyl units (7  mol) terminated by a reducing end group of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid. type ii core-oligosaccharide contained d-glucose, 2-deoxy-2-amino-d-glucose, l-rhamnose, l-glycero-d-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid, phosphate, and ethanolamine in a molar ratio of 3:2:1:1:1:1:1. type iii coreoligosaccharide was composed of d-glucose, l-glycero-d-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid, and phosphate in a molar ratio of 3:3:1:1. lipopolysaccharides of n. caviae and n. sicca contained type i core-oligosaccharides exclusively, while those of n. flava and n. perflava contained only type ii core-oligosaccharide. cellular lipopolysaccharide from n.  cinerea contained core-oligosaccharides of types i and ii in a ratio of 27:73, while the analogous preparation from n. flavescens contained core-oligosaccharide types ii and iii in a ratio of 21:4. free lipopolysaccharides from these two organisms contained only one type of coreoligosaccharide. lipid a components of all the lipopolysaccharide preparations were very similar being composed of about 25% by weight of dodecanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-dodecanoic acid, and 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoic acid.
