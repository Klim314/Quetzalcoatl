TI  == acute-phase responses in cattle infected with hydatid cysts and microbial agents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydatid cysts and microbial agents on the acute-phase response in cattle. twenty-seven cattle with  hydatid cysts and eight apparently healthy cattle comprised the study and control groups, respectively. parasitological, microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the liver and lungs were undertaken, and 49 of these organs were infected with cysts. in 14 of 31 (45.1%) livers and 10 of 18 (55.5%) lungs microbial growth was observed. the most frequent species occurring  in the liver were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter spp., whereas in the lungs the most common species was candida  spp., followed by streptococcus spp., mannheimia haemolytica, corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp. and s. aureus. the concentration of serum interleukin (il-6) in infected cattle, 455.35 +/- 39.68 pg/ml, was significantly higher than  that of 83.02 +/- 17.87 pg/ml in the control group (p0.05). the highest concentrations of il-6 were detected in serum of the cattle where microbial growth had been detected, followed by cattle infected with bacteria + trichostrongylus sp. (p< 0.001). consequently, saa showed an important increase in the group infected with hydatid cysts, whereas haptoglobin level decreased. it was noticed that il-6, like saa, had a significant role in hydatid cyst infection. therefore il-6 and saa appear to be major markers in the detection of  infection of cattle with hydatid cysts.

TI  == growth of mannheimia haemolytica: inhibitory agents and putative mechanism of inhibition.
AB  == leukotoxin-producing mannheimia haemolytica consistently causes fatal pneumonia in bighorn sheep (bhs) under experimental conditions. surprisingly, by culture methods, it has been isolated from pneumonic bhs lungs less frequently than other bacteria. however, in one study pcr assays detected m. haemolytica from over 70%  of the pneumonic lung samples that were negative for this organism by culture, suggesting that the growth of m. haemolytica is inhibited by other bacteria. previously, we have shown that bibersteinia trehalosi inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. herein we report that 100% of a diverse panel of b. trehalosi isolates (n=55) tested in a bacterial competition assay inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica, suggesting that the inhibitory phenotype is conserved. further, no plasmids were isolated from any of the 30 b. trehalosi isolates tested, suggesting that the effectors are chromosomally encoded. an earlier study by us showed that pasteurella multocida also inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. however, m. haemolytica has not been isolated even from pneumonic bhs lungs that  did not carry b. trehalosi or p. multocida. consequently, we tested staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli, the bacteria that  have been detected frequently in pneumonic bhs lungs, for possible inhibition of  m. haemolytica. neither the staphylococcus spp. nor the streptococcus sp. strains inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica. e. coli inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica by a proximity-dependent mechanism. growth inhibition of m. haemolytica by several bacterial species is likely to contribute to the infrequent detection of this bacterium from pneumonic bhs lungs by culture.

TI  == resistance to selected beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == susceptibility in vitro and trends in resistance to antimicrobials were determined by a dilution micromethod in a group of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica and escherichia coli isolates from clinical cases of cattle and swine diseases in the czech republic from 2007 to 2011. a high susceptibility of pig and cattle respiratory pathogens to antimicrobials was found, with the exception of the moderate prevalence of m. haemolytica resistance to ampicillin. in contrast to respiratory pathogens, low susceptibility of e. coli of pig and cattle isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was noted. regarding resistance trends, an increase in levels of resistance among e. coli isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was identified, but the resistance of respiratory isolates was low, with the exception of m. haemolytica. for the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit) of ceftiofur, cefquinome and other beta lactams for pigs. consumption peaked in 2010. in the case of amoxicillin in  combination with clavulanic acid, data showed a significant decrease in sales from 2007 to 2008, followed by a period of fluctuation. in cattle, within the groups of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and for the whole group of other  betalactams for the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit). consumption peaked in 2010. in the case of ceftiofur, there was a huge increase noted from 2010. in the case of amoxicillin in combination with betalactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) data shows a significant decrease from 2007 to 2008,  followed by a period of fluctuation in sales.

TI  == pathogens of bovine respiratory disease in north american feedlots conferring multidrug resistance via integrative conjugative elements.
AB  == in this study, we determined the prevalence of bovine respiratory disease (brd)-associated viral and bacterial pathogens in cattle and characterized the genetic profiles, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and nature of antimicrobial resistance determinants in collected bacteria. nasopharyngeal swab and lung tissue samples from 68 brd mortalities in alberta, canada (n = 42), texas (n = 6), and nebraska (n = 20) were screened using pcr for bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza type 3 virus, mycoplasma bovis, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, and histophilus somni. excepting bovine herpesvirus 1, all agents were detected.  m. haemolytica (91%) and bvdv (69%) were the most prevalent, with cooccurrence in 63% of the cattle. isolates of m. haemolytica (n = 55), p. multocida (n = 8), and h. somni (n = 10) from lungs were also collected. among m. haemolytica isolates,  a clonal subpopulation (n = 8) was obtained from a nebraskan feedlot. all three bacterial pathogens exhibited a high rate of antimicrobial resistance, with 45% exhibiting resistance to three or more antimicrobials. m. haemolytica (n = 18), p. multocida (n = 3), and h. somni (n = 3) from texas and nebraska possessed integrative conjugative elements (ice) that conferred resistance for up to seven  different antimicrobial classes. ice were shown to be transferred via conjugation from p. multocida to escherichia coli and from m. haemolytica and h. somni to p.  multocida. ice-mediated multidrug-resistant profiles of bacterial brd pathogens could be a major detriment to many of the therapeutic antimicrobial strategies currently used to control brd.

TI  == latent class comparison of test accuracy when evaluating antimicrobial susceptibility using disk diffusion and broth microdilution to test escherichia coli and mannheimia haemolytica isolates recovered from beef feedlot cattle.
AB  == the study objective was to use bayesian latent class analysis to evaluate the accuracy of susceptibility test results obtained from disk diffusion and broth microdilution using bacteria recovered from beef feedlot cattle. isolates of escherichia coli and mannheimia haemolytica were tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, ceftiofur, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. results showed that neither testing method was always or even generally superior to the other. specificity (ability to correctly classify non-resistant isolates) was extremely high for both testing methods, but sensitivity (ability to correctly classify resistant isolates) was lower, variable in the drugs evaluated, and variable between the two bacterial species.  predictive values estimated using bayesian markov chain monte carlo models showed that the ability to predict true susceptibility status was equivalent for test results obtained with the two testing methods for some drugs, but for others there were marked differences between results obtained from disk diffusion and broth microdilution tests.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == methodological comparisons for antimicrobial resistance surveillance in feedlot cattle.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to objectively compare methodological approaches that might be utilized in designing an antimicrobial resistance (amr)  surveillance program in beef feedlot cattle. specifically, four separate comparisons were made to investigate their potential impact on estimates for prevalence of amr. these included investigating potential differences between 2 different susceptibility testing methods (broth microdilution and disc diffusion), between 2 different target bacteria (non-type-specific e. coli [ntsec] and mannheimia haemolytica), between 2 strategies for sampling feces (individual samples collected per rectum and pooled samples collected from the pen floor), and between 2 strategies for determining which cattle to sample (cattle that were culture-positive for mannheimia haemolytica and those that were culture-negative). results: comparing two susceptibility testing methods demonstrated differences in the likelihood of detecting resistance between automated disk diffusion (biomic(r)) and broth microdilution (sensititre(r)) for  both e. coli and m. haemolytica. differences were also detected when comparing resistance between two bacterial organisms within the same cattle; there was a higher likelihood of detecting resistance in e. coli than in m. haemolytica. differences in resistance prevalence were not detected when using individual animal or composite pen sampling strategies. no differences in resistance prevalences were detected in e. coli recovered from cattle that were culture-positive for m. haemolytica compared to those that were culture-negative, suggesting that sampling strategies which targeted recovery of e. coli from m. haemolytica-positive cattle would not provide biased results. conclusions: we found that for general purposes, the susceptibility test selected for amr surveillance must be carefully chosen considering the purpose of the surveillance since the ability to detect resistance appears to vary between these tests depending upon the population where they are applied. continued surveillance of amr in m. haemolytica recovered by nasopharyngeal swab is recommended if monitoring an animal health pathogen is an objective of the surveillance program  as results of surveillance using fecal e. coli cannot be extrapolated to this important respiratory pathogen. if surveillance of e. coli was pursued in the same population, study populations could target animals that were culture-positive for m. haemolytica without biasing estimates for amr in e. coli. composite pen-floor sampling or sampling of individuals per-rectum could possibly be used interchangeably for monitoring resistance in e. coli.

TI  == reducing assembly complexity of microbial genomes with single-molecule sequencing.
AB  == background: the short reads output by first- and second-generation dna sequencing instruments cannot completely reconstruct microbial chromosomes. therefore, most  genomes have been left unfinished due to the significant resources required to manually close gaps in draft assemblies. third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem. results: to measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and analyzed the repeat complexity of 2,267 complete bacteria and archaea. our results indicate that the majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single pacbio rs sequencing library. these single-library assemblies are also more accurate than typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads. conclusions: automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data reduces the cost of microbial finishing to $1,000 for most genomes, and future advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. this is expected to increase the number of completed genomes, improve the quality of microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.

TI  == biochemical characterization of a polysialyltransferase from mannheimia haemolytica a2 and comparison to other bacterial polysialyltransferases.
AB  == polysialic acids are bioactive carbohydrates found in eukaryotes and some bacterial pathogens. the bacterial polysialyltransferases (psts), which catalyze  the synthesis of polysialic acid capsules, have previously been identified in select strains of escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis and are classified  in the carbohydrate-active enzymes database as glycosyltransferase family gt-38.  in this study using dna sequence analysis and functional characterization we have identified a novel polysialyltransferase from the bovine/ovine pathogen mannheimia haemolytica a2 (pstmh). the enzyme was expressed in recombinant form as a soluble maltose-binding-protein fusion in parallel with the related psts from e. coli k1 and n. meningitidis group b in order to perform a side-by-side comparison. biochemical properties including solubility, acceptor preference, reaction ph optima, thermostability, kinetics, and product chain length for the enzymes were compared using a synthetic fluorescent acceptor molecule. pstmh exhibited biochemical properties that make it an attractive candidate for chemi-enzymatic synthesis applications of polysialic acid. the activity of pstmh  was examined on a model glycoprotein and the surface of a neuroprogenitor cell line where the results supported its development for use in applications to therapeutic protein modification and cell surface glycan remodelling to enable cell migration at implantation sites to promote wound healing. the three psts examined here demonstrated different properties that would each be useful to therapeutic applications.

TI  == effect of subtherapeutic vs. therapeutic administration of macrolides on antimicrobial resistance in mannheimia haemolytica and enterococci isolated from  beef cattle.
AB  == macrolides are the first-line treatment against bovine respiratory disease (brd), and are also used to treat infections in humans. the macrolide, tylosin phosphate, is often included in the diet of cattle as a preventative for liver abscesses in many regions of the world outside of europe. this study investigated the effects of administering macrolides to beef cattle either systemically through a single subcutaneous injection (therapeutic) or continuously in-feed (subtherapeutic), on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of mannheimia haemolytica and enterococcus spp. isolated from the nasopharynx and faeces, respectively. nasopharyngeal and faecal samples were collected weekly over 28 days from untreated beef steers and from steers injected once with tilmicosin or  tulathromycin or continuously fed tylosin phosphate at dosages recommended by manufacturers. tilmicosin and tulathromycin were effective in lowering (p < 0.05) the prevalence of m. haemolytica, whereas subtherapeutic tylosin had no effect. m. haemolytica isolated from control- and macrolide-treated animals were susceptible to macrolides as well as to other antibiotics. major bacteria co-isolated with m. haemolytica from the nasopharynx included pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus spp., acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli and bacillus spp. with the exception of m. haemolytica and p. multocida, erythromycin resistance was frequently found in other isolated species. both methods of macrolide administration increased (p < 0.05) the proportion of erythromycin resistant enterococci within the population, which was comprised almost exclusively of enterococcus hirae. injectable macrolides impacted both respiratory and enteric microbes, whereas orally administered macrolides only influenced enteric bacteria.

TI  == bactericidal activity of tracheal antimicrobial peptide against respiratory pathogens of cattle.
AB  == tracheal antimicrobial peptide (tap) is a beta-defensin produced by mucosal epithelial cells of cattle. although effective against several human pathogens, the activity of this bovine peptide against the bacterial pathogens that cause bovine respiratory disease have not been reported. this study compared the antibacterial effects of synthetic tap against mannheimia haemolytica, histophilus somni, pasteurella multocida, and mycoplasma bovis. bactericidal activity against m. bovis was not detected. in contrast, the pasteurellaceae bacteria showed similar levels of susceptibility to that of escherichia coli, with 0.125mug tap inhibiting growth in a radial diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1.56-6.25mug/ml in a bactericidal assay. significant differences among isolates were not observed. sequencing of exon 2 of the tap gene from 23 cattle revealed a prevalent non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) a137g, encoding either serine or asparagine at residue 20 of the mature peptide. the functional effect of this snp was tested against m. haemolytica using synthetic peptides. the bactericidal effect of the asparagine-containing peptide was consistently higher than the serine-containing  peptide. bactericidal activities were similar for an acapsular mutant of m. haemolytica compared to the wild type. these findings indicate that the pasteurellaceae bacteria that cause bovine respiratory disease are susceptible to killing by bovine tap and appear not to have evolved resistance, whereas m. bovis appears to be resistant. a non-synonymous snp was identified in the coding region of the tap gene, and the corresponding peptides vary in their bactericidal activity against m. haemolytica.

TI  == brief heat treatment causes a structural change and enhances cytotoxicity of the  escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin.
AB  == alpha-hemolysin (hly) is an important virulence factor for uropathogenic escherichia coli. hly is a member of the rtx family of exotoxins secreted by a number of gram-negative bacteria. recently, it was reported that a related rtx toxin, the mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin, exhibits increased cytotoxicity following brief heat treatment. in this article, we show that brief heat treatment (1 min at 100 degrees c) increases cytotoxicity of hly for human bladder cells, kidney epithelial cells (a498) and neutrophils. heat treatment also increased hemolysis of human red blood cells (rbcs). furthermore, heat treatment of previously inactived hly restored its cytotoxicity. heat-activated and native hly both required glycophorin a to lyse rbcs. native and heat-activated hly appeared to bind equally well to the surface of a498 cells; although, western blot analyses demonstrated binding to different proteins on the surface. confocal microscopy revealed that heat-activated hly bound more extensively to internal structures of permeabilized a498 cells than did native hly. several lines of spectroscopic evidence demonstrate irreversible changes in  the structure of heat activated compared to native hly. we show changes in secondary structure, increased exposure of tryptophan residues to the aqueous environment, an increase in molecular dimension and an increase in hydrophobic surface area. these properties are among the most common characteristics described for the molten globule state, first identified as an intermediate in protein folding. we hypothesize that brief heat treatment of hly causes a conformational change leading to significant differences in protein-protein interactions that result in increased cytotoxicity for target cells.

TI  == the ompa family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  == the ompa family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in  the outer membrane of mainly gram-negative bacteria. ompa proteins are characterized by an n-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. the c-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. escherichia coli ompa is the best  characterized of the proteins. other well-characterized ompa-equivalent proteins  from pathogenic bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf, haemophilus influenzae p5, klebsiella pneumoniae ompa, and chlamydia trachomatis major outer  membrane protein (momp). ompa from the veterinary pathogens mannheimia haemolytica, haemophilus parasuis, leptospira interrogans, and pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. among many of the pathogenic bacteria, ompa proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. these pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. alternatively, ompa family proteins can serve as targets of  the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. in several cases, ompa proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == mannheimia haemolytica and its leukotoxin cause macrophage extracellular trap formation by bovine macrophages.
AB  == human and bovine neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (nets), which are protein-studded dna matrices capable of extracellular trapping and killing of pathogens. recently, we reported that bovine neutrophils release nets in response to the important respiratory pathogen mannheimia haemolytica and its leukotoxin (lkt). here, we demonstrate macrophage extracellular trap (met) formation by bovine monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to m. haemolytica or its lkt. both native fully active lkt and noncytolytic pro-lkt (produced by an lktc mutant of m. haemolytica) stimulated met formation. confocal and scanning electron microscopy revealed a network of dna fibrils with colocalized histones in extracellular traps released from bovine macrophages. formation of mets required  nadph oxidase activity, as previously demonstrated for net formation. mets formed in response to lkt trapped and killed a portion of the m. haemolytica cells. bovine alveolar macrophages, but not peripheral blood monocytes, also formed mets in response to m. haemolytica cells. met formation was not restricted to bovine macrophages. we also observed met formation by the mouse macrophage cell line raw 264.7 and by human thp-1 cell-derived macrophages, in response to escherichia coli hemolysin. the latter is a member of the repeats-in-toxin (rtx) toxin family related to the m. haemolytica leukotoxin. this study demonstrates that macrophages, like neutrophils, can form extracellular traps in response to bacterial pathogens and their exotoxins.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == capsular polysaccharide vaccine for group b neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli k1, and pasteurella haemolytica a2.
AB  == we reviewed the literature that is the basis for our proposal that (2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac conjugates will be safe and effective vaccines for group b meningococci (gbms), escherichia coli k1, and pasteurella haemolytica a2. although (2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac is a virulence factor and a protective antigen of these three pathogens, it is also a component of normal tissues (neural cell adhesion molecule). natural, anti-(2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac present in most adults, vaccine-induced antibodies, and even high levels of spontaneously appearing monoclonal anti-(2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac did not cause autoimmunity. although it is not possible to prove a null hypothesis, there are no epidemiologic, serologic, immunologic, or clinical data to indicate that (2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac antibodies will induce pathology or an autoimmune disease. no increased pathology caused by  these antibodies was found, even in neonates and infants of mothers recovered from gbm meningitis. the lack of pathology mediated by anti-(2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac  may be explained by different presentations of (2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac on bacterial  and mammalian cells and by the unusual physicochemical properties of anti-(2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac. based on clinical and experimental data collected over 30 y and because (2-->8)-alpha-neu5ac is an essential virulence factor and a protective antigen for gbm, e. coli k1, and p. haemolytica a2, protein conjugates of it are easy to prepare using inexpensive and plentiful ingredients, and they would be compatible with routinely administered infant vaccines, clinical studies of these conjugates should proceed.

TI  == plasmid-mediated florfenicol resistance in mannheimia haemolytica isolated from cattle.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse a florfenicol-resistant mannheimia haemolytica isolated from a calf to determine the genetic basis of its florfenicol-resistance. the antimicrobial susceptibility and plasmid content of the isolate were determined. a florfenicol resistant plasmid carrying the flor gene was identified by pcr and transformed into escherichia coli jm109 and hb101  strains. the plasmid was then mapped and sequenced completely. the isolate was resistant to chloramphenicol, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, kanamycin, dihydrostreptomycin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, and amoxicillin; it carried a flor plasmid of 7.7kb, designated pmh1405. the mobilisation and replication genes of pmh1405 showed extensive similarity to the 5.1-kb pdn1 plasmid from dichelobacter nodosus and the 10.8-kb pcck381 plasmid from pasteurella multocida. an adjacent 2.4-kb segment was highly homologous to the tnflor region of the e. coli bn10660 plasmid. a plasmid-mediated flor gene was responsible for florfenicol resistance in the bovine respiratory tract pathogen m. haemolytica. the pmh1405 plasmid is the smallest flor-carrying plasmid reported to date. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a florfenicol-resistant gene in m. haemolytica.

TI  == icepmu1, an integrative conjugative element (ice) of pasteurella multocida: structure and transfer.
AB  == background: integrative and conjugative elements (ices) have not been detected in pasteurella multocida. in this study the multiresistance icepmu1 from bovine p. multocida was analysed for its core genes and its ability to conjugatively transfer into strains of the same and different genera. methods: icepmu1 was identified during whole genome sequencing. coding sequences were predicted by bioinformatic tools and manually curated using the annotation software ergo. conjugation into p. multocida, mannheimia haemolytica and escherichia coli recipients was performed by mating assays. the presence of icepmu1 and its circular intermediate in the recipient strains was confirmed by pcr and sequence  analysis. integration sites were sequenced. susceptibility testing of the icepmu1-carrying recipients was conducted by broth microdilution. results: the 82 214 bp icepmu1 harbours 88 genes. the core genes of icepmu1, which are involved in excision/integration and conjugative transfer, resemble those found in a 66 641 bp ice from histophilus somni. icepmu1 integrates into a trna(leu) and is flanked by 13 bp direct repeats. it is able to conjugatively transfer to p. multocida, m. haemolytica and e. coli, where it also uses a trna(leu) for integration and produces closely related 13 bp direct repeats. pcr assays and susceptibility testing confirmed the presence and the functional activity of the  icepmu1-associated resistance genes in the recipient strains. conclusions: the observation that the multiresistance icepmu1 is present in a bovine p. multocida  and can easily spread across strain and genus boundaries underlines the risk of a rapid dissemination of multiple resistance genes, which will distinctly decrease  the therapeutic options.

(n = 16), serratospiculum seurati infestation (n = 14), cestodiasis (n = 6), bumblefoot (n = 5), trematodosis due to strigea falconispalumbi (n = 5), trichomoniasis (n = 4), babesia shortti (n = 4), mannheimia (pastorella) haemolytica (n = 4), interstitial hepatitis (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), and clostridium perfringens enterotoxemia (n = 2). compared with a control group of 2000 diseased falcons without evidence of aspergillosis, the prevalence of babesia shortti, cfids, mannheimia (pastorella)  haemolytica, escherichia coli, and falcon herpes virus infection was conspicuously higher in association with aspergillosis. these entities may be considered suitable candidates as predisposing factors for the mycosis.

TI  == combinations of macrolide resistance determinants in field isolates of mannheimia haemolytica and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == respiratory tract infections in cattle are commonly associated with the bacterial pathogens mannheimia haemolytica and pasteurella multocida. these infections can  generally be successfully treated in the field with one of several groups of antibiotics, including macrolides. a few recent isolates of these species exhibit resistance to veterinary macrolides with phenotypes that fall into three distinct classes. the first class has type i macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotic resistance and, consistent with this, the 23s rrna nucleotide a2058 is monomethylated by the enzyme product of the erm(42) gene. the second class shows  no lincosamide resistance and lacks erm(42) and concomitant 23s rrna methylation. sequencing of the genome of a representative strain from this class, p. multocida 3361, revealed macrolide efflux and phosphotransferase genes [respectively termed msr(e) and mph(e)] that are arranged in tandem and presumably expressed from the  same promoter. the third class exhibits the most marked drug phenotype, with high resistance to all of the macrolides tested, and possesses all three resistance determinants. the combinations of erm(42), msr(e), and mph(e) are chromosomally encoded and intermingled with other exogenous genes, many of which appear to have been transferred from other members of the pasteurellaceae. the presence of some  of the exogenous genes explains recent reports of resistance to additional drug classes. we have expressed recombinant versions of the erm(42), msr(e), and mph(e) genes within an isogenic escherichia coli background to assess their individually contributions to resistance. our findings indicate what types of compounds might have driven the selection for these resistance determinants.

TI  == bacterial ghosts as antigen and drug delivery system for ocular surface diseases: effective internalization of bacterial ghosts by human conjunctival epithelial cells.
AB  == the purpose of the presented investigation was to examine the efficiency of the novel carrier system bacterial ghosts (bgs), which are empty bacterial cell envelopes of gram-negative bacteria to target human conjunctival epithelial cells, as well as to test the endocytic capacity of conjunctival cells after co-incubation with bgs generated from different bacterial species, and to foreclose potential cytotoxic effects caused by bgs. the efficiency of conjunctival cells to internalize bgs was investigated using the chang conjunctival epithelial cell line and primary human conjunctiva-derived epithelial cells (hcdecs) as in vitro model. a high capacity of hcdecs to functionally internalize bgs was detected with the level of internalization depending on the type of species used for bgs generation. detailed analysis showed no cytotoxic effect of bgs on hcdecs independently of the used bacterial species. moreover, co-incubation with bgs did not enhance expression of both mhc  class i and class ii molecules by hcdecs, but increased expression of icam-1. the high rates of bg's internalization by hcdecs with no bg-mediated cytotoxic impact designate this carrier system to be a promising candidate for an ocular surface drug delivery system. bgs could be useful for future therapeutic ocular surface applications and eye-specific disease vaccine development including dna transfer.

TI  == a novel erm monomethyltransferase in antibiotic-resistant isolates of mannheimia  haemolytica and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == mannheimia haemolytica and pasteurella multocida are aetiological agents commonly associated with respiratory tract infections in cattle. recent isolates of these  pathogens have been shown to be resistant to macrolides and other ribosome-targeting antibiotics. direct analysis of the 23s rrnas by mass spectrometry revealed that nucleotide a2058 is monomethylated, consistent with a  type i erm phenotype conferring macrolide-lincosamide resistance. the erm resistance determinant was identified by full genome sequencing of isolates. the  sequence of this resistance determinant, now termed erm(42), has diverged greatly from all previously characterized erm genes, explaining why it has remained undetected in pcr screening surveys. the sequence of erm(42) is, however, completely conserved in six independent m. haemolytica and p. multocida isolates, suggesting relatively recent gene transfer between these species. furthermore, the composition of neighbouring chromosomal sequences indicates that erm(42) was  acquired from other members of the pasteurellaceae. expression of recombinant erm(42) in escherichia coli demonstrated that the enzyme retains its properties as a monomethyltransferase without any dimethyltransferase activity. erm(42) is a novel addition to the erm family: it is phylogenetically distant from the other erm family members and it is unique in being a bona fide monomethyltransferase that is disseminated between bacterial pathogens.

TI  == localization and functional characterization of pulmonary bovine odorant-binding  protein.
AB  == bovine odorant-binding protein (obp) may function in olfaction and defense against oxidative injury, but its role in inflammation and defense against bacterial infection has not been investigated. expression of obp was discovered in the bovine lung and found to undergo changes in abundance during glucocorticoid administration and stress. obp was localized to nasal, tracheal, and bronchial mucosal glands with immunohistochemistry, with faint expression in  airway surface epithelium and none in bronchioles or alveoli. two isoforms of obp were identified, appearing to be differentially regulated during lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary inflammation, but differences between these  isoforms were not revealed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. functional studies showed no effect of obp on in vitro  growth of escherichia coli or mannheimia haemolytica under iron-replete or iron-depleted conditions, nor did obp opsonize bacteria for an enhanced neutrophil oxidative burst. however, obp did reduce the ability of supernatants from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages to induce neutrophil chemotaxis. these findings indicate that obp may inhibit neutrophil recruitment by inflammatory mediators, and they suggest an ability to bind macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators within the airways.

TI  == molecular cloning, characterization and in vitro expression of serpin b1 of bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis) and domestic sheep (ovis aries), and comparison with that of other species.
AB  == mannheimia haemolytica infection results in enhanced pmn-mediated tissue damage in the lungs of bighorn sheep (bhs) compared to that of domestic sheep (ds). serpin b1 is an inhibitor of pmn-derived serine proteases. it prevents lung tissue injury by inhibiting the serine proteases released as a result of pmn lysis and degranulation. it is conceivable that pmns of bhs exhibit decreased quantity and/or activity of serpin b1 which results in enhanced tissue injury and decreased bacterial clearance in pneumonic lungs of bhs. the objective of this study was to clone and express serpin b1 of bhs and ds, and develop antibodies to facilitate quantification of serpin b1. the 1,134bp cdna of serpin b1 of bhs and  ds encodes a polypeptide of 377 amino acids. serpin b1 of bhs and ds exhibits 100% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. the amino acid sequence of ovine (bhs/ds) serpin b1 displays 69%, 71%, 74%, 78% and 80% identity with that of rats, dogs, mice, humans and horses, respectively. ovine serpin b1 expressed in escherichia coli was used to develop polyclonal antibodies in mice. western blot analysis revealed the specificity of these antibodies for ovine rserpin b1.

TI  == n-terminal region of mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin serves as a mitochondrial  targeting signal in mammalian cells.
AB  == mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin (lkta) is a member of the rtx toxin family that specifically kills ruminant leukocytes. previous studies have shown that lkta induces apoptosis in susceptible cells via a caspase-9-dependent pathway that involves binding of lkta to mitochondria. in this study, using the bioinformatics tool mitoprot ii we identified an n-terminal amino acid sequence of lkta that represents a mitochondrial targeting signal (mts). we show that expression of this sequence, as a gfp fusion protein within mammalian cells, directs gfp to mitochondria. by immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that lkta interacts with the  tom22 and tom40 components of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (tom), which suggests that import of this toxin into mitochondria involves a classical import pathway for endogenous proteins. we also analysed the amino acid sequences of other rtx toxins and found a mts in the n-terminal region of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae apxii and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ehxa, but not in a. pleuropneumoniae apxi, apxiii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ltxa or the haemolysin (hlya) from uropathogenic strains of e. coli. these findings provide a new evidence for the importance of the n-terminal region in addressing certain rtx toxins to mitochondria.

TI  == expression and activity of n-myristoyltransferase in lung inflammation of cattle  and its role in neutrophil apoptosis.
AB  == n-myristoyltransferase (nmt) attaches a 14 carbon fatty acid, myristic acid, to the n-terminal glycine residue of proteins. nmt exists in two isoforms nmt1 and nmt2. myristoylated proteins play critical roles in protein-protein interactions, cell signaling and oncogenesis. although elevated expression of nmt1 has been described in colorectal carcinoma, its expression and roles in normal and inflamed lungs of the cattle are unknown. therefore, we investigated the expression and activity of nmt in a bovine model of lung inflammation induced with mannheimia hemolytica and in vitro in neutrophils and macrophages. western blots revealed increased expression of nmt1 in lungs from infected animals compared to control animals. total nmt activity was reduced in inflamed lungs compared to control animals (p < 0.05) along with increased expression of enolase, a putative inhibitor of nmt. nmt1 staining was observed in the septum, vascular endothelium and the epithelium in the lungs from control as well as infected calves. nmt1 expression was intense in neutrophils in the necrotic areas in the inflamed lungs. immuno-electron microscopy localized nmt1 in cytoplasm and nuclei of endothelium, pulmonary intravascular macrophages and airway epithelium. total nmt activity and nmt1 expression were increased in neutrophils and macrophages exposed to escherichia coli lps in vitro. nmt knockdown increased apoptosis in activated neutrophils. this is the first report demonstrating expression of nmt in normal and inflamed lungs and a novel role for nmt in regulation of neutrophil lifespan.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic integration of orbifloxacin  in korean hanwoo cattle.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orbifloxacin were studied in six clinically healthy hanwoo cows after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.)  administration at a dose of 3 mg/kg. orbifloxacin concentrations were determined  by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. steady-state volume of distribution and clearance of orbifloxacin after i.v. administration were 0.92 l/kg and 0.24 l/h x kg, respectively. following i.m. administration, a slow and complete absorption with absolute bioavailability of 101.4%, and a maximum concentration (c(max)) of 1.17 microg/ml at 1.04 h were observed. the in vitro serum protein binding was 14.76%. the in vitro antibacterial activity of orbifloxacin against a pathogenic strain of mannheimia  haemolytica (m. haemolytica), escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was determined. the ex vivo activity of orbifloxacin against m. haemolytica strain was also determined, and these data were integrated with the ex vivo bacterial counts to establish auc(24h)/mic values producing bacteriostatic action, bactericidal action and elimination of bacteria. mean values were 32.7, 51.6 and 102.6 h, respectively. from these data, we predict that orbifloxacin, when administered i.m. at a dosage of 2.5-5 mg/kg once a day,  would be effective against bovine pathogens, such as m. haemolytica. additional studies may be needed to confirm its efficacy in a clinical setting, and to evaluate the penetration of the drug in diseased tissues.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different european countries: 2002-2004.
AB  == background: the project "antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - ii" (arbao-ii) was funded by the european union (fair5-qlk2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in european countries  based on validated and harmonised methodologies. available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. method: antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.a proficiency test (eqas - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test  the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. the data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the eqas the results are comparable between countries. results: data  from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 european countries. for staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. for mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in france, the netherlands and portugal.  all isolates of pasteurella multocida isolated in finland and most of those from  denmark, england (and wales), italy and sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis isolates from sweden were fully susceptible. for the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. more resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. conclusion: in general, isolates from denmark, england (and wales), the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from belgium, france, italy, latvia and spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. in the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.

AB  == a total of 368 bacterial pathogens, including 72 coagulase-positive and coagulase-variable staphylococci, 97 beta-haemolytic streptococci, 51 escherichia coli, 75 pasteurella multocida, 25 mannheimia haemolytica, 25 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 23 arcanobacterium pyogenes, were investigated for their susceptibility to the three combinations of antimicrobial agents lincomycin/spectinomycin (1/2), penicillin g/neomycin (1/1), and penicillin g/dihydrostreptomycin (1/1) in comparison to their susceptibility to the corresponding single substances. when comparing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined for any of the three combinations with those for the single substances, the lowest mic of one of the two substances usually determined the mic of the combination.this observation was made for all three combinations and all bacterial pathogens tested.thus, it is assumed that the combination of lincomycin with spectinomycin as well as that of penicillin with either neomycin or dihydrostreptomycin resulted in an extended spectrum of target bacterial pathogens rather than in an increase in antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == clinical mastitis in ewes; bacteriology, epidemiology and clinical features.
AB  == background: clinical mastitis is an important disease in sheep. the objective of  this work was to identify causal bacteria and study certain epidemiological and clinical features of clinical mastitis in ewes kept for meat and wool production. methods: the study included 509 ewes with clinical mastitis from 353 flocks located in 14 of the 19 counties in norway. clinical examination and collection of udder secretions were carried out by veterinarians. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was performed on 92 staphylococcus aureus isolates from 64 ewes. results and conclusion: s. aureus was recovered from 65.3% of 547 clinically affected mammary glands, coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2.9%, enterobacteria, mainly escherichia coli, from 7.3%, streptococcus spp. from 4.6%, mannheimia haemolytica from 1.8% and various other bacteria from 4.9%, while no bacteria were cultured from 13.2% of the samples. forty percent of the ewes with  unilateral clinical s. aureus mastitis also had a subclinical s. aureus infection in the other mammary gland. twenty-four of 28 (86%) pairs of s. aureus isolates obtained from clinically and subclinically affected mammary glands of the same ewe were indistinguishable by pfge. the number of identical pairs was significantly greater than expected, based on the distribution of different s. aureus types within the flocks. one-third of the cases occurred during the first  week after lambing, while a second peak was observed in the third week of lactation. gangrene was present in 8.8% of the clinically affected glands; s. aureus was recovered from 72.9%, clostridium perfringens from 6.3% and e. coli from 6.3% of the secretions from such glands. this study shows that s. aureus predominates as a cause of clinical ovine mastitis in norway, also in very severe cases. results also indicate that s. aureus is frequently spread between udder halves of infected ewes.

AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == results of the antimicrobial agent susceptibility study raised in a representative, cross-sectional monitoring study on a national basis.
AB  == the use of antimicrobial substances in human and veterinary medicine inevitably results in a selection pressure for drug resistance in exposed bacteria. preventive measures, apt to avoid the consequent development of new resistances and selection for existing ones, respectively, have to be elaborated. moreover, it has to be ensured that neither resistant bacteria nor resistance genes are spread to and consequently via the food chain. respiratory diseases as well as mastitis in dairy cattle belong to the most frequently occurring diseases in food-producing animals. for the first time in germany, a comprehensive, cross-sectional study into the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria associated with these disease patterns in food-producing animals was conducted by the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) in 2001. the selection of examined bacterial species comprised pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica associated with respiratory disease in pigs, and escherichia coli, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. causing mastitis in  dairy cattle. bacterial strains were collected following a representative sampling scheme, taking into account the total number of animals in the individual german federal lander. in an analogous study conducted in 2002/2003, this selection was extended by the indication respiratory disease in juvenile cattle, caused by p. multocida and m. haemolytica, respectively. in comparison with data from 2001, mic values determined in 2002/2003 suggested significantly lower or higher degrees of drug susceptibility only for a few antimicrobial agents. comparison was carried out on the basis of bacterial species and individual federal lander, respectively. overall, the data raised in both studies revealed substantially lower resistance rates than published for germany so far.  this is particularly true for results from those lander, whose animal health services had implemented preventive strategies to control infectious diseases. no correlation could be established between differing animal population densities and differences in the prevalence of resistance in corresponding lander. however, the geographical distribution of occurrence of resistance against beta-lactam antimicrobial agents suggests different therapeutic strategies employed in different sized animal flocks. in federal lander marked by large-scale livestock  farming, significantly higher resistance values could be measured for cephalosporins than for penicillins, whereas in lander with rather traditional farming structures, resistance to penicillins was predominant. assuming otherwise similar factors of influence on the emergence of resistance, this pattern suggests that cephalosporins are preferably used in large enterprises and penicillins in smaller farms, respectively. currently, mechanisms effecting changes in antimicrobial resistance are being further investigated in a successive study.

TI  == monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria from livestock animals.
AB  == facing the problem of development and spreading of bacterial resistance, preventive strategies are considered the most appropriate means to counteract. the establishment of corresponding management options relies on scientifically defensible efforts to obtain objective data on the prevalence of bacterial resistance in healthy and diseased livestock. additionally, detailed statistics are needed on the overall amount of antimicrobial agents dispensed in germany. the collection of valid data on the prevalence of resistance requires representative and cross-sectional studies. the german national antimicrobial resistance monitoring of the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) determines the current quantitative resistance level of life-stock pathogens, in order to permit the evaluation and surveillance of the distribution of resistances on a valid basis. essential key features determining the design of these studies comprise (1) a statistically valid sampling program. this incorporates regional differences in animal population density, (2) the avoidance of "copy strains", (3) testing of no more than two bacterial strains belonging to one species per herd, (4) testing only if no antimicrobial therapy preceded sample collection, and (5) the use of standardized methods [e.g. microdilution broth method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)]. the analysis and interpretation of this data permits reliable identification and definition of epidemiological characteristics of resistance and its development in animal associated bacteria, such as geographically and time wise differentiated profiles on its prevalence, the emergence of unknown phenotypes of resistance and an assessment of the threat resistant bacteria from animals pose for humans. in applied antimicrobial therapy, the data can serve as a decision guidance in choosing the antimicrobial agent most adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation. the susceptibility testing performed by the bvl suggests substantially lower degrees of resistance in bacteria isolated from cattle (mastitis: escherichia coli, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp.; respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica) and pigs (respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica) in comparison to data published for germany so far. this includes results for substances that have given cause for frequent debate. only rare cases of resistance to enrofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) could be detected, and only 3% of bacterial strains tested proved resistant to 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, including substances prescribed in human medicine.

AB  == to evaluate the role of leukotoxin (lkt) of mannheimia haemolytica and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of e. coli 055:b5 in pathogenesis of bovine respiratory  disease (brd) we investigated their in vitro effects on cultured bovine neutrophils. functional parameters of neutrophils including degranulation, generation of superoxide, and nitric oxide were distorted in response to both toxins. the most essential reaction of neutrophils was found in respect to release of elastase after addition of lkt as well as lps at concentration of 300  microg/ml. moreover, we observed an increased release of myeloperoxidase (mpo) and alkaline phosphatase (alk-p) from polymorphonuclear cells (pmn) after addition of lkt and lps. we also found enhanced superoxide generation by bovine neutrophils after exposure to different concentrations of lkt and lps. in cultures of pmn treated with lkt, concentration of nitrite increased with growing concentrations of lkt. lower values of nitrite were obtained in cultures exposed  to lps. partial lysis of pmn, determined by ldh (lactate dehydrogenase) leakage,  started at concentration of 300 microg/ml for both toxins, meanwhile lkt concentration above 300 microg/ml was lethal. our study has revealed that neutrophils in response to both toxins exaggerate release of analysed substances, which participate in worsening the course of the disease and play a role in lung  injury during brd. toxins introduced to the cultural medium stimulate release of  studied constituents from neutrophils by combined activation and lysis of neutrophils.

TI  == clinical evaluation of postpartum vaginal mucus reflects uterine bacterial infection and the immune response in cattle.
AB  == bacteria contaminate the uterus of most dairy cattle after parturition and endometritis causes infertility. an endometritis score can be ascribed based on the vaginal mucus character and odour but it is not clear if the clinical score reflects the number of uterine bacteria or the inflammatory response. the present study tested the hypothesis that clinical evaluation of endometritis reflects the number of bacteria present in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response. swabs (n = 328) were collected from the uterine lumen of dairy cattle, 21 and 28  days postpartum, vaginal mucus was scored for character and odour, and blood samples collected for acute phase protein measurement. bacteria were identified following aerobic and anaerobic culture, and the bacterial growth density was scored semi-quantitatively. when bacteria were categorised by their expected pathogenic potential in the uterus, purulent or fetid odour vaginal mucus was associated with the growth density of pathogenic bacteria but not opportunist contaminants. when bacteria were analysed independently, arcanobacterium pyogenes, proteus and fusobacterium necrophorum growth densities were associated  with mucopurulent or purulent vaginal mucus. the bacterial growth densities for a. pyogenes, escherichia coli, non-hemolytic streptococci, and mannheimia haemolytica were associated with a fetid mucus odour. peripheral plasma concentrations of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein were higher if there was a fetid compared with a normal vaginal mucus odour (1.50 +/- 0.09 mg/ml versus 1.05 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, p < 0.001), but did not differ significantly between vaginal mucus character scores. the evaluation of the character and odour of vaginal mucus reflects the number of bacteria in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response.

AB  == the postmortem records of 160 white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) submitted for necropsy examination from 59 separate pennsylvania captive deer farms over a 3.5-year period were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. the most common causes of death were bronchopneumonia (39 cases), enterocolitis (30 cases), malnutrition (13 cases), and trauma (11 cases). other causes of mortality included severe gastrointestinal parasitism (6 cases),  cellulitis with septicemia (5 cases), degenerative myopathy (4 cases), ruminal acidosis (4 cases), and nephritis (4 cases). the cause of death was undetermined  in 13 of the 160 animals. arcanobacterium pyogenes (19 cases), fusobacterium necrophorum (10 cases), escherichia coli (7 cases), and mannheimia haemolytica (4 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the pneumonic lungs. bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included clostridium perfringens (15 cases), e. coli (12 cases), and mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (2 cases). the majority (52.2%) of the death loss in white-tailed deer of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 46.2% of the bronchopneumonia cases and 50.0% of the enterocolitis cases occurring during this time period. cases of degenerative myopathy, myocardial degeneration, hepatic necrosis, meningoencephalitis, peritonitis, and urolithiasis considered severe enough to be the primary cause of death appeared early in life, affecting deer 6  months of age or less in all cases. in conclusion, bronchopneumonia, enterocolitis, malnutrition, and trauma were considered the most common causes of death in confined white-tailed deer in this study.

TI  == towards the establishment and standardization of a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in south africa.
AB  == the objective of this study was to establish a repeatable, standardized laboratory procedure for monitoring the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from animals and food of animal origin in south africa, with reagents prepared in-house. the emergence of resistance and the spread of resistant bacteria can be limited by implementing a veterinary antimicrobial drug policy, in which inter alia systematic monitoring and prudent use play essential  roles. the bacteria included in this study represented three different categories, namely zoonotic bacteria (salmonella), indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) and veterinary pathogens (mannheimia haemolytica). thirty isolates of each species were collected with the aim of standardizing the laboratory methodology for a future national veterinary surveillance and monitoring programme. susceptibility to ten  selected antimicrobial drugs was determined by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the microdilution method. the method according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used as the standard. multi-well plates containing varying dilutions of antimicrobial drugs and prepared in-house for mic determinations, yielded repeatable results. storage of  plates for 2 months at -70 degrees c did not influence results meaningfully. within this limited sample of bacteria, mic results did not indicate meaningful resistance against any of the ten selected antimicrobial drugs. the findings of the study will be used to establish a national veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in south africa. to allow for international comparison of data, harmonisation of the surveillance and monitoring programme in accordance with global trends is encouraged. ideally it should be combined with a programme monitoring the quantities of antimicrobial drugs used. the aim is to contribute to slowing down the emergence of resistance  and the problems associated with this phenomenon by means of the rational use of  antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight european countries.
AB  == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the  use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen  was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995  to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

TI  == otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == crystal structure of pasteurella haemolytica ferric ion-binding protein a reveals a novel class of bacterial iron-binding proteins.
AB  == pasteurellosis caused by the gram-negative pathogen pasteurella haemolytica is a  serious disease leading to death in cattle. to scavenge growth-limiting iron from the host, the pathogen utilizes the periplasmic ferric ion-binding protein a (phfbpa) as a component of an atp-binding cassette transport pathway. we report the 1.2-a structure of the iron-free (apo) form of phfbpa, which is a member of the transferrin structural superfamily. the protein structure adopts a closed conformation, allowing us to reliably assign putative iron-coordinating residues. based on our analysis, phfbpa utilizes a unique constellation of binding site residues and anions to octahedrally coordinate an iron atom. a surprising finding in the structure is the presence of two formate anions on opposite sides of the iron-binding pocket. the formate ions tether the n- and c-terminal domains of the protein and stabilize the closed structure, also providing clues as to probable candidates for synergistic anions in the iron-loaded state. phfbpa represents a new class of bacterial iron-binding proteins.

TI  == mutant bacteriophage with non-catalytic endosialidase binds to both bacterial and eukaryotic polysialic acid and can be used as probe for its detection.
AB  == there is a molecular mimicry between the polysialic acid polysaccharide of bacterial pathogens causing sepsis and meningitis, and the carbohydrate units of  the neural cell adhesion molecule ncam. we investigated whether bacteriophage mutants with catalytically disabled endosialidase, which bind but do not cleave polysialic acid, could recognise and bind to bacterial and eukaryotic polysialic  acid. in nitrocellulose dot blot assay the mutant bacteriophages, but not the wild-type phages, remained specifically bound to polysialic acid-containing bacteria including escherichia coli k1 and k92, group b meningococci, mannheimia  (pasteurella) haemolytica a2, and moraxella nonliquefaciens. a minimum binding requirement was determined to be 10 sialyl residues in the polysialic acid chain. in western blots the mutant phages specifically bound to the embryonic polysialylated form of ncam, but not to the adult less sialylated form of the molecule. the mutant phages together with secondary anti-phage antibodies were subsequently successfully used in fluorescence microscopy of cultured cells and light microscopy of paraffin-embedded tissue sections as a probe for the eukaryotic polysialic acid. thus, mutant bacteriophages of meningitis causing bacteria bind to and detect the molecularly mimicked polysialic acid of the neural cell adhesion molecule in host tissues.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == construction and characterization of an acapsular mutant of mannheimia haemolytica a1.
AB  == the nmaa and nmab genes, which code for udp-glcnac-2-epimerase and udp-mannac-dehydrogenase, respectively, are involved in capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in mannheimia haemolytica a1. a chloramphenicol resistance (cm(r)) cassette cloned behind an m. haemolytica a1 promoter, plpcat, was created and used to interrupt nmaa and nmab. a 1.3-kbp dna fragment that encompasses part of  nmaa and nmab was replaced by the 1.0-kbp plpcat, resulting in a knockout mutant  which is cm(r) and unable to synthesize n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and n-acetylmannosaminuronic acid (mannaca). the dna replacement was confirmed by southern hybridization and pcr analyses of the nmaa and nmab loci. electron microscopy examination of the mutant showed the absence of capsular materials compared to the parent strain. the loss of nmaa and nmab activity was confirmed by analysis of carbohydrate moieties using capillary electrophoresis. serum sensitivity assays indicated that the acapsular mutant is as resistant as the encapsulated parent to complement-mediated killing by colostrum-deprived calf serum but is more sensitive to killing by immune bovine serum. analysis of lipopolysaccharide prepared from the acapsular mutant and encapsulated parent confirmed that these strains have long o-polysaccharide chains, possibly conferring resistance to serum-mediated killing.

TI  == studies on the production of quorum-sensing signal molecules in mannheimia haemolytica a1 and other pasteurellaceae species.
AB  == the bioluminescence assay system using vibrio harveyi reporter strains were used  to examine quorum-sensing autoinducer (ai) activity from mannheimia haemolytica a1 cell-free culture supernatant. we showed that m. haemolytica a1 cell-free culture supernatant contains molecules that can stimulate the quorum-sensing system that regulates the expression of the luciferase operon in v. harveyi. specifically, m. haemolytica a1 can stimulate only the quorum system 2 but not system 1, suggesting that the culture supernatant only contains molecules similar to ai-2 of v. harveyi. the bioluminescence assay was also used to show that culture supernatants from related pasteurellaceae organisms, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella trehalosi, actinobacillus suis and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, also contain ai-2-like molecules. this is consistent with the presence of a luxs homolog in the genomes of p. multocida and a. pleuropneumoniae. a luxs homolog was cloned by pcr from m. haemolytica a1 using sequencing data from the ongoing genome sequencing project. the cloned luxs(m.h.) was able to complement ai-2 production in the escherichia coli dh5alpha luxs mutant. this is the first report of a quorum-sensing activity in m. haemolytica a1 and suggests that this bacterium utilizes this mechanism to regulate expression of genes under specific conditions.

TI  == a putative iron-regulated tonb-dependent receptor of mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica a1: possible mechanism for phase variation.
AB  == a recombinant plasmid that codes for a novel iron receptor protein (irp) of mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica a1 was isolated by the partial complementation of an escherichia coli fur mutant. the deduced amino acid sequence of irp exhibited characteristics typical of tonb-dependent receptors. these include: a tonb-box at the n-terminal; a 50 amino acid region homologous to the "plug" domain of the e. coli fhua and fepa receptors; and a c-terminal tonb-dependent signature which likely functions as an outer membrane anchoring domain. previously uncharacterized irp homologues were detected by blast analysis of available databases and incomplete microbial genomes. when the irp homologues  from neisseria gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis were cloned by pcr and expressed in e. coli, novel proteins of the predicted size (84kda) were detected in cell lysates, demonstrating that these are functional genes. the m. haemolytica a1 irp gene undergoes phase variation at a nucleotide region which contain the sequence  aaaaaaattaaaa (7a-2t-4a) flanked by a short inverted repeat. site-specific mutagenesis of the 7a-2t-4a sequence as well as replacement of the inverted repeats resulted in a stable construct that expressed the irp protein without phase variation. the expression of irp in m. haemolytica a1 was regulated by iron concentrations and most likely a fur homologue, consistent with the proposed function of irp in iron metabolism. the irp genes may represent contingency loci  that play a role in iron acquisition during infection.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

TI  == bacteremia associated with naturally occuring acute coliform mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (acm) with a wide range of disease severity. design: cohort study. animals: 144 dairy cows with acm from 6 herds. procedure: cows were examined at time of identification of acm (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), cbc, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. appropriate samples were  obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an acm episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. results: bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). group-1  isolates (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with acm and 0 of 156 control cows. group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe acm, respectively. escherichia coli and k pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of  the same genotype. bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. conclusions and  clinical relevance: results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with acm. classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with acm.

TI  == kinetic properties of the acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from pasteurella haemolytica a2.
AB  == neuroinvasive and septicaemia-causing pathogens often display a polysialic acid capsule that is involved in invasive behaviour. n-acetylneuraminic acid (neuac) is the basic monomer of polysialic acid. the activated form, cmp-neu5ac, is synthesized by the acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase (act; ec 2.7.7.43). we have purified this enzyme from pasteurella haemolytica a2 to apparent homogeneity (522-fold). the protein behaved homogeneously on sds/page as a 43 kda band, a size similar to that of escherichia coli, calf, mouse and rat. specific activity  in crude lysate displayed one of the highest values cited in the literature (153  m-units/mg). we have studied the steady-state kinetic mechanism of the enzyme by  using normalized plot premises. the catalysis proceeds through a ping pong bi bi  mechanism, with ctp as the first substrate and cmp-neuac as the last product. the true km values were 1.77 mm for ctp and 1.82 mm for neuac. the nucleotides cdp, utp, udp and ttp, and the modified sialic acid n-glycolylneuraminic acid were also substrates of the act activity. the enzyme is inhibited by cytidine nucleotides through binding to a second cytidyl-binding site. this inhibition is  greater with nucleotides that display a long phosphate tail, and the genuine inhibitor is the substrate ctp. at physiological concentrations, atp is an activator, and amp an inhibitor, of the act activity. the activated sugar udp-n-acetylglucosamine acts as an inhibitor, thus suggesting cross-regulation of the peptidoglycan and polysialic acid pathways. our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the nature of sialic acid activation and suggest new targets for the approach to the pathogenesis of encapsulated bacteria.

TI  == bordetella bronchiseptica fimbrial protein-enhanced immunogenicity of a mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin fragment.
AB  == leukotoxin produced by mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica is an important virulence factor in shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle and is a critical  protective antigen. in this study, the immune response to a chimeric protein generated by combining a gene fragment encoding neutralizing epitopes of m. haemolytica leukotoxin and a fimbrial protein gene (fim n) from bordetella bronchiseptica was evaluated. the recombinant gene was cloned in a bacterial expression vector under the control of the tac promoter and expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione-s-transferase (gst) in escherichia coli. immunization of mice with the recombinant protein, gst-ltxfim elicited a significantly stronger anti-leukotoxin antibody response than comparable immunizations with gst-ltx fusion proteins lacking fim n. the gst-ltxfim was also more stable than gst-ltx during storage at -80 degrees c, thus alleviating a stability problem inherent to leukotoxin. this chimeric protein may be a candidate for inclusion in new generation vaccines against shipping fever pneumonia.

TI  == genetic analysis of virulence factors of mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica a1.
AB  == using a molecular genetic approach, the genes that code for the various virulence factors of mannheimia haemolytica a1 have been cloned for detailed characterizations. these included analysis of the encoded proteins, their biological activities, secretion of the molecules from the bacterium as well as their use in a vaccine component. two newly characterized antigens of m. haemolytica a1 have been identified. the first one is a tonb-dependent iron regulated outer-membrane receptor that is distinct from the transferrin binding proteins. the 84kda irp protein exhibits features including a tonb box and a 50 amino acid region that can adopt occluded beta-barrel structures similar to the "plug" domain of the escherichia coli fhua and fepa crystal structures. homologues of irp were identified by analysis of the genome sequences of a number of gram negative mucosal pathogens, including neisseria meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. the neisserial irp genes were cloned by pcr and expressed the 84kda  protein as expected, demonstrating that they are functional genes. in addition to being regulated by iron and fur, irp(mh) undergoes phase variation by a slipped-strand mispairing mechanism and may represent a contingency locus for iron acquisition during an infection. another locus that codes for a putative adhesin molecule has also been partially characterized. this putative adhesin protein is highly homologous with the high-molecular-weight adhesin proteins of non-piliated non-typable strains of haemophilus influenzae (nthi) including hia,  hsf, hmw1, hmw2. currently, we have cloned the dna that codes for 2223 amino acids (225kda) and is still missing the stop codon. it is anticipated that when complete, the protein could be close to 240kda, similar to the molecular mass of  hsf. though incomplete, analysis of the adhesin showed that it exhibits characteristics of autotransporter (at) proteins. the role of this high-molecular-weight adhesin in infection is being investigated.

TI  == analysis of the capsule biosynthetic locus of mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica a1 and proposal of a nomenclature system.
AB  == a 16-kbp dna region that contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of the capsule of mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica a1 has been characterized. the gene cluster can be divided into three regions like those of the typical group ii capsule biosynthetic clusters in gram-negative bacteria. region 1 contains four genes (wzt, wzm, wzf, and wza) which code for an atp-binding cassette transport apparatus for the secretion of the capsule materials across the membranes. the m. haemolytica a1 wzt and wzm genes were able to complement escherichia coli kpst and kpsm mutants, respectively. further, the atp binding activity of wzt was demonstrated by its affinity for atp-agarose, and the lipoprotein nature of wza was supported by [(3)h]palmitate labeling. region 2 contains six genes; four genes (orf1/2/3/4) code for unique functions for which no homologues have been identified to date. the remaining two genes (nmaa and nmab) code for homologues of udp-n-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase and udp-n-acetylmannosamine dehydrogenase, respectively. these two proteins are highly homologous to the e. coli wecb and wecc proteins (formerly known as rffe and rffd), which are involved in the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (eca). complementation of an e. coli rffe/d mutant with the m. haemolytica a1 nmaa/b genes resulted in the restoration of eca biosynthesis. region 3 contains two genes (wbra and wbrb) which are suggested to be involved in the phospholipid modification of capsular materials.

AB  == in a previous study, a recombinant plasmid that contains a cacag pentanucleotide  repeat was isolated from a pasteurella haemolytica a1 library. southern hybridization analysis using a (cacag)5probe indicated the presence of two loci that contain the pentanucleotide repeats on the genome of p.haemolytica a1. additional hybridization analyses against genomic dna from related microorganisms indicated that the repeats are only present in p.haemolytica and pasteurella trehalosi t3. the various serotypes of p.haemolytica werefound to have either one or two of the cacag repeat-containing loci. examination of the locus designated rpt2 by pcr and sequence analysis indicated that the number of cacag repeats could change upon serial subculture which most likely occurs as a result of dna slipped-strand mispairing. a plasmid carrying the rpt2 locus was isolated and characterized. sequenceanalysis indicated that the cacag repeats are contained within the 5'-end of a gene that showed homology to mod genes of type iii restriction-modification systems. a second open reading frame downstream was identified which showed homology to res genes of type iii restriction-modification systems. both the modification and restriction proteins  could be expressed and polypeptides of the expected sizes were detected by sds-page. restriction activity could also be detected in crude cytoplasmic extracts of escherichia coli strains carrying the mod and res genes on recombinant plasmids.

TI  == the pasteurella haemolytica 35 kda iron-regulated protein is an fbpa homologue.
AB  == in a previous investigation, a 35 kda iron-regulated protein was identified from  total cellular proteins of pasteurella haemolytica grown under iron-depleted conditions. this study reports identification of the gene (fbpa) encoding the 35  kda protein based on complementation of an enta escherichia coli strain transformed with a plasmid derived from a p. haemolytica lambda zap ii library. cross-reactivity was demonstrated between an anti-35 kda mab and a 35 kda protein expressed in this strain. furthermore, a translated orf identified on the recombinant plasmid corresponded with the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the intact and a cnbr-cleaved fragment of the 35 kda iron-regulated protein. nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene encoding the 35 kda protein demonstrated homology with the cluster 1 group of extracellular solute-binding proteins, especially to the iron-binding proteins of this family. complete sequence analysis of the recombinant plasmid insert identified three other predominant orfs, two of which appeared to be in an operonic organization with fbpa. these latter components (fbpb and fbpc) showed homology to the transmembrane and atpase components of atp-binding cassette (abc)-type uptake systems, respectively. based on amino acid/dna sequencing, citrate competition assay of iron affinity and visible wavelength spectra, it was concluded that the p. haemolytica 35 kda protein functions as an fbpa homologue (referred to as pfbpa) and that the gene encoding this protein is part of an operon comprising a member of the fbpabc family of iron uptake systems. primary sequence analysis revealed rather surprisingly that pfbpa is more closely related to the intracellular mn/fe-binding protein idia found in cyanobacteria than to any of the homologous fbpa proteins currently known in commensal or pathogenic members of the pasteurellaceae or neisseriaceae.

TI  == target cell specificity of the pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin is unaffected by the nature of the fatty-acyl group used to activate the toxin in vitro.
AB  == the leukotoxin (lkta) of pasteurella haemolytica is active only against cells of  ruminant origin. it is synthesised as an inactive protoxin encoded by the lkta gene and post-translationally modified to the active toxin by the product of the  lktc gene. the lkta and lktc proteins were expressed separately in escherichia coli and partially purified. active lkta was produced in vitro in the presence of lktc and acyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) charged separately in vitro with a fatty-acyl group. the toxic activity and target cell specificity of lkta and adenylate cyclase toxin (cyaa), a toxin active against a wide variety of mammalian cells, were investigated after activation with acp charged with different fatty acids. palmitoyl-acp produced the most active toxin in both cases and, although other fatty acids were also effective, the fatty acid preference was the same for the in vitro activation of both toxins. activated lkta remained  ruminant cell-specific whichever acyl group was used to acylate the a protoxin.

TI  == characterization of a 54-kda heat-shock-inducible protein of pasteurella haemolytica.
AB  == growth-condition-dependent antigens play a role in the virulence or protective capacity of many organisms. enhanced production of an approximately 54-kda protein was detected in heat-shocked cultures of pasteurella haemolytica. the heat-shock-inducible protein cross-reacted with antibodies to 60-kda heat-shock proteins of mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia, and escherichia coli groel. a  probe containing the e. coli groel operon hybridized with fragments of p. haemolytica chromosomal dna on southern blots. immunoblots of the 54-kda protein  using serum from 20 calves that were challenged experimentally with p. haemolytica resulted in band densities that were significantly different between  calves with high and low lesion scores. results of the study suggest that the 54-kda heat-shock protein may be a growth-condition-dependent immunogen that is one component of resistance to pneumonic pasteurellosis.

AB  == the tbpa and tbpb genes encoding the transferrin receptor proteins, tbpa and tbpb, from pasteurella haemolytica a1 were cloned, sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli. the genes were organized in a putative operon arrangement of tbpb- tbpa. the tbpb gene was preceded by putative promoter and regulatory sequences, and followed by a 96 base pair intergenic sequence in which no promoter regions were found, suggesting that the two genes are coordinately transcribed. the deduced amino acid sequences of the tbpa and tbpb proteins had regions of homology with the corresponding neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae tbp and lbp proteins. the intact tbpb gene was expressed in a t7 expression system and the resulting recombinant tbpb protein retained the functional bovine transferrin binding characteristics. the availability of the recombinant tbpb enabled us to demonstrate its specificity for ruminant transferrins, its ability to bind both the c-and n-terminal lobes of bovine transferrin and its preference for the iron-loaded form of this protein. several attempts at expressing the cloned tbpa  gene were unsuccessful, suggesting that the product of the gene may be toxic to e. coli.

TI  == refolding of recombinant pasteurella haemolytica a1 glycoprotease expressed in an escherichia coli thioredoxin gene fusion system.
AB  == pasteurella haemolytica a1 secretes an o-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (ec. 3.4.24.57) (glycoprotease: gcp) which is specific for o-linked sialoglycoproteins. when the cloned gene is expressed in escherichia coli, the recombinant glycoprotease (rgcp) is secreted to the periplasm where it is present as a disulfide-linked aggregate which lacks enzymatic activity. in vitro refolding and activation of rgcp by mammalian protein disulfide isomerase (pdi) or by the e. coli chaperones (dnak, dnaj and grpe) indicate that the redox environment of rgcp is critical in restoring biological activity. a fusion protein, rtrx-gcp, was constructed to investigate the role of thioredoxin (e. coli trxa) in the production of enzymatically active rgcp. this 47 kda protein was expressed at a high level, in a soluble, monomeric form, in the cytoplasm of  e. coli. cleavage of the fusion protein by enterokinase released the rgcp fragment (35 kda) with glycoprotease activity. a higher recombinant glycoprotease activity was recovered after anion exchange chromatography of lysates of e. coli  expressing rtrx-gcp. thus when e. coli trxa is combined in a recombinant fusion protein with p. haemolytica a1 gcp, productive folding of the glycoprotease can occur as a result of the chaperone action of the protein disulfide reductase coupled with its ability to retain the fusion gene product in the e. coli cytoplasm.

TI  == structure-function studies of the adenylate cyclase toxin of bordetella pertussis and the leukotoxin of pasteurella haemolytica by heterologous c protein activation and construction of hybrid proteins.
AB  == the adenylate cyclase toxin (cyaa) from bordetella pertussis and the leukotoxin (lkta) from pasteurella haemolytica are members of the rtx (stands for repeats in toxin) family of cytolytic toxins. they have pore-forming activity and share significant amino acid homology but show marked differences in biological activity. cyaa is an invasive adenylate cyclase and a weak hemolysin which is active on a wide range of mammalian cells. lkta is a cytolytic protein with a high target cell specificity and is able to lyse only leukocytes and platelets from ruminants. each toxin is synthesized as an inactive protoxin encoded by the  a gene, and the product of the accessory c gene is required for posttranslational activation. heterologous activation of lkta by cyac did not result in a change in its specificity for nucleated cells, although the toxin showed a greater hemolytic-to-cytotoxic ratio. lktc was unable to activate cyaa. a hybrid toxin (hyb1), which contained the n-terminal enzymic domain and the pore-forming domain from cyaa (amino acids [aa] 1 to 687), with the remainder of the protein derived  from the c-terminal end of lkta (aa 379 to 953), showed no toxic activity. replacement of part of the lkta c-terminal domain of hyb1 by the cyaa c-terminal  domain (aa 919 to 1706) to create hybrid toxin 2 (hyb2) partially restored toxic  activity. in contrast to cyaa, hyb2 was activated more efficiently by lktc than by cyac, showing the importance of the region between aa 379 and 616 of lkta for  activation by lktc. lktc-activated hyb2 was more active against ruminant than murine nucleated cells, whereas cyac-activated hyb2 displayed a similar, but lower, activity against both cell types. these data indicate that lktc and the region with which it interacts have an influence on the target cell specificity of the mature toxin.

AB  == this study was conducted to partially characterize and identify the purity of two major outer membrane proteins (omps) (with molecular weights of 32,000 and 35,000 [32k and 35k, respectively]) of pasteurella haemolytica. the 35k and 32k major omps, designated pasteurella outer membrane proteins a and b (poma and pomb, respectively), were extracted from p. haemolytica by solubilization in n-octyl polyoxyl ethylene. the p. haemolytica strain used was a mutant serotype a1 from which the genes expressing the 30-kda lipoproteins had been deleted. poma and pomb were separated and partially purified by anion-exchange chromatography. poma but not pomb was heat modifiable. the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the two  proteins were determined and compared with reported sequences of other known proteins. poma had significant n-terminal sequence homology with the ompa protein of escherichia coli and related proteins from other gram-negative bacteria. moreover, polyclonal antiserum raised against the e. coli ompa protein reacted with this protein. poma was surface exposed, was conserved among p. haemolytica biotype a serotypes, and had porin activity in planar bilayers. no homology between the n-terminal amino acid sequence of pomb and those of other known bacterial proteins was found. cattle vaccinated with live p. haemolytica developed a significant increase in serum antibodies to partially purified poma,  as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and to purified poma and pomb, as detected on western blots and by densitometry.

TI  == the restriction-modification system of pasteurella haemolytica is a member of a new family of type i enzymes.
AB  == genes encoding the type i restriction-modification (r-m) system of the bovine pathogen, pasteurella haemolytica, have been identified immediately downstream of a locus that encodes a transcriptional activator of p. haemolytica leukotoxin expression. type i enzymes are encoded by three genes called hsdm, hsds and hsdr, and have fallen into three groups, called ia, ib and ic. hsds provides a sequence recognition function which in concert with hsdm forms an active methyltransferase (mtase). inclusion of the hsdr subunit in the complex creates an active restriction endonuclease (enase) capable of cleaving unmethylated target dna. the p. haemolytica hsdmsr genes were mapped using transposon tn10d-cam insertions, and bacteriophage restriction and modification assays in escherichia coli. we determined the nucleotide sequences of hsdm, hsds and hsdr, and observed that the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were very similar to predicted r-m subunits in  the respiratory pathogen, haemophilus influenzae. phylogenetic comparisons of all known hsd aa sequences placed the p. haemolytica and h. influenzae proteins into  a new group which we labeled the type id r-m family. expression of the p. haemolytica r-m genes in e. coli was inefficient and is likely to be a consequence of the unusual codon usage in p. haemolytica genes.

TI  == escherichia coli hemolysin mutants with altered target cell specificity.
AB  == in order to understand the functional significance of hlyc-dependent acylation of the escherichia coli hemolysin structural protein (hlya), random as well as site-directed substitutions at the known regions of modification, i.e., those at  lysine residues at amino acid positions 563 and 689 (hlyak563 and hlyak689, respectively), were isolated. sixteen random hlya mutations were identified on the basis of a screen for loss of immunoreactivity to the hemolysin-neutralizing  d12 monoclonal antibody that reacts to only hlyc-activated hlya. these substitutions occurred at the region from hlyae684 to hlyay696. a recombinant glutathione s-transferase-hemolysin gene fusion encoding glutathione s-transferase-hlyas608-t725 residues reacts with monoclonal antibody when hlyc is coexpressed with the fusion protein. therefore, at most only 12% of the total hlya primary sequence is needed for hlyc-facilitated acylation at the hlyak689 position, and this modification can occur in the absence of the proximal hlyak563 acylation site. the cytolytic activities of these hlya mutants against sheep erythrocytes and bovine and human lymphocyte cell lines (bl-3 and raji cells, respectively) were analyzed. hlyak563 and hlyak689 substitutions displayed various degrees of loss of cytotoxicity that depended on the particular amino acid replacement. an hlyak563c variant retained greater than 59 and 21% of its bl-3-lytic and erythrolytic activities, respectively, but was nearly inactive against raji cells. an hlya mutant with a k-to-e substitution at amino acid 689 (hlyak689e) was essentially inactive against all three cell types, whereas an hlyak689r substitution had a pattern of activity similar to that of the hlyak563c mutant. preceding the two in vitro acylated hlya lysines are glycines that appear to be the only amino acids conserved in alignments of these regions among the rtx toxins. remarkably, considering the retention of cytotoxic activity by some hlyak689 mutants, each of three different substitutions at the hlyag688 position  was relatively inactive against all three cell types tested. this suggests that hlyag688 plays a significant structural role in cytotoxic activity apart from its possible participation in an hlyc activation process which presumably requires recognition of pro-hlya structures. the related rtx toxin, the pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin structural protein (lkta), can be activated in an e. coli  recombinant background by hlyc. in amino acid sequence alignments, lktak554 is equivalent to the hlyak563 position but it has an asparagine (lktan684) at the homologous hlyak689 site. an lktan684k substitution possesses wild-type leukotoxin activity against bl-3 cells and does not acquire hemolytic or raji cell cytotoxic activity. surprisingly, both lktak554c and lktak554t substitutions retain considerable bl-3 cytotoxicity (45 and 49%, respectively), indicating that there may be additional lysines within lkta that the hlyc activation mechanism is capable of acylating. based on these results and a comparison of amino acid sequence alignments of 12 rtx toxins, a putative consensus structure of the rtx residues necessary for hlyc activation is hypothesized.

TI  == construction of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae-escherichia coli shuttle vectors: expression of antibiotic-resistance genes.
AB  == we constructed several cloning vectors, designated pgzrs-18/19 and pgzrs-38/39, which were based on an endogenous actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (apl) 4.3-kb plasmid. they carry the lacz alpha-complementation fragment and mcs from puc18/19, and either the bla gene under the control of a putative apl promoter or the kmr gene from tn903. these vectors replicate in representative strains of apl serotypes 1 and 7, escherichia coli, pasteurella haemolytica (ph) and haemophilus (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans. we also found that apl and ph did not express genes under the control of the lacz or bla promoters, suggesting that their rna polymerases may not utilize these promoters.

TI  == structural analysis and comparison of the c-terminal transport signal domains of  hemolysin a and leukotoxin a.
AB  == nmr spectroscopy was used to study the structure of the c-terminal signal sequences of the bacterial toxins, hemolysin a(hlya) and leukotoxin a (lkta). the two signals share little sequence homology; however, both can direct toxin transport with equal efficiency. we report here that in a membrane mimetic environment both peptides form two short non-interacting alpha-helices separated  by a short loop. this higher order structure may be a common feature of c-terminal signals and may be required for interaction with the membrane associated transporter complex.

AB  == a pasteurella haemolytica a1 gene involved in the biosynthesis of a moiety on the core of the lipopolysaccharide molecule has been cloned and characterized. escherichia coli clones which carry this gene showed an alteration of its lipopolysaccharide migration profile on tricine sds-page and exhibited resistance to the core-specific phage u3. in addition, lipopolysaccharide extracted from the e. coli clones was recognized by an anti-corespecific antiserum, but not by antiserum specific for the o antigen of p. haemolytica a1 lipopolysaccharide. nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned dna identified an open reading frame (lpsa) coding for a protein of 263 amino acids which showed significant homology  with a haemophilus influenzae type b lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis gene. pcr amplification of genomic dna, using primers based on the p. haemolytica a1 lpsa sequence, yielded products from only the a biotypes of p. haemolytica.

TI  == secretion and circular dichroism analysis of the c-terminal signal peptides of hlya and lkta.
AB  == the secretion of the 107 kda hemolysin a (hlya) from escherichia coli is mediated by membrane proteins hemolysin b (hlyb) and hemolysin d (hlyd). the signal for transport has been mapped to the c-terminal 60 amino acids of the hyla molecule.  we have shown previously that the c-terminal 70 amino acids of leukotoxin (lkta)  from pasteurella hemolytica can substitute functionally for the hlya signal sequence. this 70 amino acid peptide contains little primary sequence similarity  to the hlya signal sequence, and we have hypothesized that these signal sequences assume a similar higher-order structure which is recognized by the hlyb/d transporter. in the present study, we have expressed and purified small peptides  containing the c-terminal 61 amino acids of hlya and the c-terminal 70 amino acids of lkta. we show that these signal peptides are sufficient for secretion from e. coli in a hlyb/d dependent manner. circular dichroism analyses show that  both molecules exhibit common biophysical properties. in aqueous solution, they appear to be mainly unstructured, but in a membrane mimetic environment they assume a helical secondary structure. the conformational change observed for both peptides going from an aqueous to a membrane mimetic environment may be an important feature of these signal sequences necessary for their recognition and transport.

AB  == an ssa1-homologous genomic fragment cloned from pasteurella haemolytica serotype  2 (st2) enabled transformation of escherichia coli dh5 alpha to a serotype 1 (st1) phenotype through expression of the st1-specific antigen (ssa1). the ssa1 protein expressed by ssa1-transformed e. coli was susceptible to heat and protease treatment and was distinct from p. haemolytica st1-specific capsular polysaccharide. electrophoretic analysis of in vitro-translated proteins, as well as the predicted amino acid sequence, demonstrated that ssa1 proteins encoded from either st1- or st2-derived ssa1 genes were essentially identical. a comparison of the nucleotide sequences of ssa1 genes derived from p. haemolytica  st1 and st2 revealed greater than 99% homology. amino acid sequence homology of the predicted products of st1- and st2-derived ssa1 genes was greater than 98%. northern (rna) blot studies revealed that the presence of an increased level of ssa1 transcript in p. haemolytica st1 grown as surface-adherent cultures on solid medium was correlated with a serologically detectable ssa1 protein. expression of the ssa1 transcript in st1 was similarly upregulated by a high iron concentration in the growth medium.

AB  == a shuttle cloning vector, paka16, and suicide derivatives paka19 and paka22 have  been developed for gene transfer to pasteurella haemolytica and p. multocida. paka16 was constructed by insertion of the lacz alpha-peptide-encoding region and a multiple cloning site into a plasmid which was originally isolated from p. haemolytica serotype a1. the vector encodes ampicillin resistance, and contains at least 14 unique restriction sites and the property of phenotypic identification of recombinant clones in escherichia coli by insertional inactivation of beta-galactosidase activity. it can be transferred by conjugation to p. haemolytica or p. multocida and is stably maintained in both species. the type-ii chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-encoding gene (cat), cloned into paka16, was stably expressed in both p. haemolytica and p. multocida. plasmids paka19 and paka22 were constructed by replacement of the origin of dna replication (ori) of paka16 with a cole1-type ori from pbr322 or an ori of plasmid r6k (orir6k) from pjm703.1, respectively. these derivatives replicate in  e. coli, but not in either p. haemolytica or p. multocida, and are suitable for use as suicide vectors for these pasteurella species.

AB  == pasteurella haemolytica is the leading cause of economic loss to the beef cattle  industry in the united states and an important etiologic agent worldwide. study of p. haemolytica is hindered by researchers' inability to genetically manipulate the organism. a new restriction endonuclease, phai, an isoschizomer of sfani (r.  j. roberts, methods enzymol. 65:19-36, 1980), was isolated from p. haemolytica serotype 1, strain nadc-d60, obtained from pneumonic bovine lung. phai recognizes the 5-base nonpalindromic sequences 5'-gcatc-3' and 5'-gatgc-3'. cleavage occurs  5 bases 3' from the former recognition site and 9 bases 5' from the latter recognition site. a gene encoding a methyltransferase which protects against phai cleavage was cloned from p. haemolytica nadc-d60 into escherichia coli. whereas unmethylated plasmid dna containing a p. haemolytica origin of replication was unable to transform p. haemolytica when introduced by electroporation, the same plasmid dna obtained from e. coli which contained a cloned phai methyltransferase gene could do so. the data indicate that phai is an effective barrier to the introduction and establishment of exogenous dna in p. haemolytica.

TI  == static dna bending and protein interactions within the pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin promoter region: development of an activation model for leukotoxin transcriptional control.
AB  == in this study, we define cis-acting elements involved in regulation of the pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin promoter. in place of a canonical promoter -35 sequence, the leukotoxin promoter contains four adenine-rich repeats of sequence  ca6(c/t)a, phased at approximately 10-base intervals. dna fragments containing these repeats exhibit retarded mobility in polyacrylamide gels and permitted identification of a static dna bend in the promoter -70 region. deletion of the static dna bend caused a two-fold reduction of leukotoxin transcription in escherichia coli, suggesting that it is involved in promoter regulation. three putative upstream activator sites (uas), similar to those that bind the nifa activator in klebsiella pneumoniae, are found 130 bp upstream from the transcription start site and are protected from dnase i cleavage by a p. haemolytica-specific factor. the promoter region also binds the dna bending protein, the integration host factor (ihf), although ihf mutations do not affect  its expression in e. coli. the arrangement of these elements suggests that leukotoxin expression is activated by a factor that interacts with the uas and regulates transcription initiation at a distance via dna looping. activation and  dna bending may also influence a second, divergent promoter that lies 340 bp upstream from the leukotoxin start site.

AB  == pasteurella haemolytica in cattle produces fibrino-hemorrhagic pleuropneumonia characterized by extensive pulmonary microvascular thrombosis and parenchymal necrosis. the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine if p. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide (lps) promotes vascular thrombosis by inducing a procoagulant  state in vascular endothelial cells. after treatment of confluent monolayers of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells with various concentrations of either p. haemolytica lps or escherichia coli lps, the procoagulant activity of the endothelial cells was determined using a chromogenic assay dependent on cellular  tissue factor expression. the lps treatment induced significant increases in cellular tissue factor expression in a lps concentration- and time-dependent manner. highest levels of tissue factor were present at 22 hours after treatment, although high lps concentrations induced moderate tissue factor levels at 5 hours after treatment. interleukin-1 also induced tissue factor expression in endothelial cells and enhanced the lps-induced effects. this interleukin-1 effect could be diminished by concurrent use of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. these results demonstrate that lps and cytokine promotion of a procoagulant state in endothelial cells occurs in vitro. similar mechanisms may play a role in p. haemolytica-mediated pulmonary vascular thrombosis.

[14c]palmitate labelling coupled with glybomycin inhibition experiments showed that plp1, -2, and -3 are also lipoproteins. in addition, plpa, -b, and -c were found to be present only in a biotypes of p. haemolytica by southern blot analysis. since plp1, -2, and -3 were found to be antigenic components in a culture supernatant vaccine, they could be candidates for further investigation as vaccine components.

TI  == functional replacement of the hemolysin a transport signal by a different primary sequence.
AB  == secretion of the 107-kda hemolysin a (hlya) from escherichia coli is mediated by  the membrane proteins hemolysin b and hemolysin d. hemolysin b is a member of the so-called atp binding cassette transporter superfamily, which includes the multidrug resistance p-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis cftr protein, and the major histocompatibility complex-associated transporter of antigenic peptides. recognition of hlya by the hemolysin b/d transporter is dependent on a signal sequence mapped to the c-terminal 50 or so amino acids of the hlya molecule. we show that the c-terminal 70 amino acids of leukotoxin from pasteurella hemolytica can substitute functionally for the hlya signal sequence. this 70-amino acid sequence contains no primary sequence similarity to the hlya signal sequence; however, structural motifs of helix-turn-helix followed by strand-loop-strand can be deduced for both sequences. we also demonstrate by site-directed mutagenesis that changes to these predicted motifs affect transport function. it thus appears that the transport signal of hlya may be defined by a higher-order structure and  that the hemolysin transporter may recognize a much wider diversity of primary sequences than previously anticipated. this finding may have implications for understanding the basis of substrate specificity of other atp binding cassette transporters.

TI  == ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae by normal serum.
AB  == pulmonary surfactant has been shown to play an increasingly important role in bacterial clearance at the alveolar surface in the lung. this study describes a bactericidal mechanism in which ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica by normal serum. to demonstrate killing, six bacterial species were incubated first with pulmonary surfactant for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then with serum for an additional 60 min at 37 degrees c. p. haemolytica type a1 strains 82-25 and l101, a p. haemolytica type 2 strain, escherichia coli, and  klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible and pasteurella multocida, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible to killing by ovine pulmonary surfactant and normal serum. no bacteria incubated with bovine pulmonary surfactant were killed by normal serum. although the species origin of  pulmonary surfactant was selective, the species origin of serum was not. p. haemolytica incubated with ovine pulmonary surfactant was killed by fetal calf serum, gnotobiotic calf serum, pooled normal sheep serum, pooled normal rabbit serum, and pooled guinea pig serum. ultrastructurally, killed p. haemolytica suspensions contained dead cells and cells distorted with vacuoles between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. the mechanism of killing did not correlate with concentrations of complement or lysozyme or titers of residual antibody in either the pulmonary surfactant or the serum, and killing was reduced by preincubation of surfactant with p. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide. preliminary characterization of both surfactant and serum implicate a low-molecular-weight proteinaceous component in the surfactant and serum albumin  in the serum. this mechanism may help clear certain gram-negative bacteria from the lungs of sheep as a part of the pulmonary innate defense system.

TI  == using ribosomal rna gene restriction patterns in distinguishing isolates of pasteurella haemolytica from bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis).
AB  == pasteurella haemolytica isolates (n = 31) from two isolated captive herds of rocky mountain bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis canadensis) were characterized and  compared phenotypically (biotype, serotype, hemolytic activity) and by a genomic  fingerprinting method known as ribotyping. seven to nine distinct phenotypes were observed. depending on the method used for serotyping, one to three phenotypes were common to both herds. eighteen isolates, recovered from both herds, were non-hemolytic, biotype t, indirect hemagglutination assay serotype 4. ribotyping, a method for highlighting genetically conserved deoxyribonucleic acid restriction site heterogeneity with a 32p-labelled escherichia coli ribosomal ribonucleic acid probe, produced six to eight distinct ribotype pattern groups within the 31  p. haemolytica isolates, depending on the restriction enzyme used. in contrast to phenotypes, ribotypes appeared unique to each herd, and ribotyping helped to further differentiate some isolates of the same biotype and serotype. in addition, ribotyping provided an alternative means for evaluating relationships between isolates differing in hemolytic activity but which were otherwise phenotypically identical. we propose that ribotyping may be a useful adjunct to other bacterial characterization methods in studying the epizootiology of pasteurellosis in bighorn sheep.

TI  == distinct plasmid profiles of pasteurella haemolytica serotypes and the characterization and amplification in escherichia coli of ampicillin-resistance plasmids encoding rob-1 beta-lactamase.
AB  == thirty-five isolates of pasteurella haemolytica from cattle or sheep were screened for the presence of plasmids and for resistance to a range of antibiotics. eight strains (four of serotype a1, three of serotype a2 and one untypable) contained plasmid dna and isolates of the same serotype had similar plasmid profiles, which were different from those of the other serotypes. all but one of the plasmid-bearing strains were isolated from pneumonic animals or from animals in contact with pneumonic cattle or sheep. in a2 and untypable strains, there was no obvious correlation between antibiotic resistance and the presence of a specific plasmid. in contrast, all plasmid-bearing a1 strains exhibited ampicillin resistance (apr), which was shown by transfer studies to be plasmid-mediated. plasmid dna prepared from e. coli transformants was not routinely detected on ethidium-bromide-stained agarose gels, but could be amplified to detectable levels by treatment of cultures with chloramphenicol (cm) or by modifying the growth conditions. the apr plasmids from p. haemolytica were  identical by restriction enzyme analysis. restriction analysis and hybridization  data indicated that these plasmids were closely related to the prototype rob-1 beta-lactamase-encoding plasmid, originally isolated from haemophilus influenzae. from substrate profiles and isoelectric focusing data, the beta-lactamases encoded by the p. haemolytica plasmids were indistinguishable from the rob-1 beta-lactamase.

TI  == construction of a broad host range shuttle vector for gene cloning and expression in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other pasteurellaceae.
AB  == we have constructed a pair of broad host range expression vectors, pjff224-nx and pjff224-xn, based on plasmid rsf1010, which enable cloning and efficient expression of genes in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella haemolytica and in escherichia coli. the vectors consist of the minimal autonomous replicon of the broad host range plasmid rsf1010 and a type ii chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene for chloramphenicol resistance selection. in addition, they contain a gene expression cassette based on the e. coli bacteriophage t4 gene 32 promoter region and a transcription stop signal, which are separated by a segment of multiple cloning sites in both orientations. electroporation and subsequent selection for chloramphenicol resistance was used  for the introduction of the vectors in a. pleuropneumoniae and p. haemolytica. a  promoterless xy/e gene from the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid was cloned onto pjff224-nx. this plasmid enabled efficient expression of active catechol2,3oxygenase in a. pleuropneumoniae and p. haemolytica. it was stably maintained in a. pleuropneumoniae without antibiotic selection, showing less than 0.1% loss after 100 generations, while native rsf1010 and other rsf1010-based vectors were unstable in this host.

TI  == characterization of plasmids with antimicrobial resistant genes in pasteurella haemolytica a1.
AB  == two r plasmids, pyfc1 and pyfc2, from pasteurella haemolytica a1 encoding sulfonamide, streptomycin (pyfc1), and ampicillin (pyfc2) resistances have been characterized by restriction endonuclease digestions, subcloning or dna sequencing. pyfc1 consists of 4225 bp and is 51.9% in at content. physical mapping indicated a highly conserved region of restriction sites among pyfc1, rsf1010, pgs05, pfm739, phd148 and pgs03b. pyfc1 encoded a dihydropteroate synthase (29.8 kda), and streptomycin kinase (29.6 kda) which is homologous in nucleotide sequences or deduced amino acid sequence to that encoded by a broad-host range incq plasmid rsf1010. based on the primary structure of pyfc1, the sulfonamide and streptomycin genes are derived from the same ancestor of rsf1010. pyfc2 is similar to the plasmid from p. haemolytica lnpb51 isolated in france by partial restriction enzyme mapping. pyfc1 and pyfc2 have the same size  of 4.2 kbp.

TI  == identification of rtx toxin target cell specificity domains by use of hybrid genes.
AB  == the escherichia coli hemolysin (hlya) and pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin (lkta) are cytolytic toxins encoded by genes belonging to the recently described  rtx gene family. these cytotoxins are, respectively, 1,023 and 953 amino acids in length and are encoded by genes within identically organized operons. they share  45% amino acid sequence identities but differ in their target cell specificities. in vitro-derived recombinant hybrid genes between hlya and lkta were constructed  by using restriction endonuclease sites created by oligonucleotide site-directed  mutagenesis. the cytolytic activity of hybrid proteins was investigated using as  targets sheep erythrocytes and two cultured cell lines from different species (bl3, bovine leukemia-derived b lymphocytes; and raji, human b-cell lymphoma cells). hlya is cytolytic to all three cell types. lkta lyses only bl3 cells. among the hybrid proteins displaying cytolytic activity, the striking finding is  that the hemolytic activity of several lkta-hlya hybrids was independent of any cytolytic activity against either cultured cell species. the hemolytic activity was associated with the hlya region between amino acids 564 and 739. structures that are critical for hlya cytolytic activity against bl3 or raji cells were destroyed when lkta-hlya and hlya-lkta hybrids were made, respectively, at amino  acid positions 564 and 739 of hlya. in contrast to hlya, which lysed the two different cultured cell lines with equal efficiency, lkt-hlya hybrids possessing  the amino-terminal 169 residues of lkta lysed bl3 cells more efficiently than raji cells. this suggests that a significant but not exclusive element of the lkta ruminant cell specificity resides in the amino-terminal one-fifth of the protein. a molecular model of the functional domains of hlya and lkta is presented.

TI  == genomic distribution of a serotype 1-specific antigen-coding dna fragment of pasteurella haemolytica.
AB  == a genomic fragment of pasteurella haemolytica biotype a coding for a serotype 1-specific agglutinating antigen was used as a probe in a series of hybridization experiments to determine distribution of the fragment in various p. haemolytica serotypes as well as other bacteria. results showed presence of the fragment in seven out of the 12 serotypes tested, all of which belonged to biotype a. two other serotypes belonging to biotype a, all three serotypes belonging to biotype  t, two pasteurella multocida isolates and escherichia coli did not have the fragment in their genome. thus the expression of the p. haemolytica biotype a serotype 1-specific agglutinating antigen (pha1saa) seems to be due to serotype-specific regulation of protein expression rather than to genetic deletion. differences in methylation of the pha1saa-coding fragment was also noted in dpni and sau3ai genomic dna digests from the various serotypes analyzed  by southern blot. however, no apparent correlation was observed between methylation and pha1saa expression. e. coli with a recombinant plasmid containing a homologous genomic fragment derived from p. haemolytica serotype 2 also expressed pha1saa.
