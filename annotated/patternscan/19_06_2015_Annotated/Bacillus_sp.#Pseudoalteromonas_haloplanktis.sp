TI  == use of psychrophilic xylanases provides insight into the xylanase functionality in bread making.
AB  == the bread-improving potential of three psychrophilic xylanases from pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis tah3a (xph), flavobacterium sp. msy-2 (rxfh), and  unknown bacterial origin (rxyn8) was compared to that of the mesophilic xylanases from bacillus subtilis (xbs) and aspergillus aculeatus (xaa). xph, rxfh, and rxyn8 increased specific bread volumes up to 28%, 18%, and 18%, respectively, while xbs and xaa gave increases of 23% and 12%, respectively. this could be related to their substrate hydrolysis behavior. xylanases with a high capacity to solubilize water-unextractable arabinoxylan (wu-ax) during mixing, such as xbs and xph, increased bread volume more than xylanases that mainly solubilized wu-ax during fermentation, such as rxfh, rxyn8, and xaa. irrespective of their intrinsic bread-improving potential, the dosages needed to increase bread volume  to a similar extent were much lower for psychrophilic than for mesophilic xylanases. the xylanase efficiency mainly depended on the enzyme's temperature activity profile and its inhibition sensitivity.

TI  == [antibiotic properties of the pseudoalteromonas genus bacteria isolated from the  black sea water and molluscs].
AB  == antagonistic properties of 41 strains of alteromonas-like bacteria isolated from  the black sea water and molluscs have been studied. being grown on the rich medium "b" for marine bacteria, 21% of strains have shown high antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungi; 6% of strains inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, proteus vulgaris and candida albicans. spectrum of antagonistic activity was essentially changed on synthetic "bm" medium with acetate, glutamate, alpha-alanine as a single source of carbon and was directed against pseudomonas aeruginosa. culture liquids and acetone extracts of microbial biomass of 34% of the studied strains have shown activity against bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria. strains producing the wide spectrum of antimicrobial substances (alteromonas macleodii, pseudoalteromonas citrea, p. haloplanktis, p.  aurantia, pseudoalteromonas sp.), fungicidal and algocidal substances have been found. both extra- and intracellular metabolities of marine bacteria (including the pigments) were active.
