TI  == phylogenic and phenotypic characterization of some eubacterium-like isolates from human feces: description of solobacterium moorei gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  == three isolated strains from human feces were characterized by biochemical tests and 16s rdna analysis. phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolated strains were members of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria. the phenotypic characters resembled those of the genus eubacterium, but these strains were shown to be phylogenetically distant from the type species of the genus, eubacterium limosum. the strains showed a specific phylogenetic association with  holdemania filiformis and erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. based on a 16s rdna sequence divergence of greater than 12% with h. filiformis and e. rhusiopathiae,  a new genus, solobacterium, is proposed for three strains, with one species, solobacterium moorei. the type strain of solobacterium moorei is jcm 10645t.
