TI  - Kinetic properties of adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase of intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  - The investigation of specific activity of ATP sulfurylase and kinetic properties  of the enzyme in cell-free extracts of intestinal bacterial strains Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9 is presented. The microbiological, biochemical, biophysical and statistical methods were used in the work. The optimal temperature (35 degrees C) and pH 8.0-8.5 for enzyme reaction were determined. An analysis of kinetic properties of ATP sulfurylase has been carried out. Initial (instantaneous) reaction velocity (V0), maximum amount of the product of reaction (Pmax), the reaction time (half saturation period, tau) and maximum velocity of the ATP sulfurylase reaction (Vmax) have been defined. Michaelis constants (Km(Sulfate), Km(ATP), Km(APS), and Km(Pyrophosphate)) of the enzyme reaction were demonstrated for both D. piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9 intestinal bacterial strains.
TI  - Activity and kinetic properties of phosphotransacetylase from intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  - Phosphotransacetylase activity and the kinetic properties of the enzyme from intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio piger and Desulfomicrobium sp. has never been well-characterized and has not been studied yet. In this paper, the specific activity of phosphotransacetylase and the kinetic properties of the enzyme in cell-free extracts of both D. piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9 intestinal bacterial strains were presented at the first time. The microbiological, biochemical, biophysical and statistical methods in this work were used. The optimal temperature and pH for enzyme reaction was determined. Analysis of the kinetic properties of the studied enzyme was carried out. Initial (instantaneous) reaction velocity (V0), maximum amount of the product of reaction (Pmax), the reaction time (half saturation period, tau) and maximum velocity of the phosphotransacetylase reaction (Vmax) were defined. Michaelis constants (Km) of the enzyme reaction (3.36 +/- 0.35 mM for D. piger Vib-7, 5.97 +/- 0.62 mM for Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9) were calculated. The studies of the phosphotransacetylase in the process of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and kinetic properties of this enzyme in intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria, their production of acetate in detail can be perspective for clarification of their etiological role in the development of the humans and animals bowel diseases. These studies might help in predicting the development of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, by providing further details on the etiology of bowel diseases which are very important for the clinical diagnosis of these disease types.
TI  - Acetate kinase Activity and Kinetic Properties of the Enzyme in Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9 Intestinal Bacterial Strains.
AB  - Activity of acetate kinase in cell-free extracts and individual fractions and the kinetic properties of the enzyme obtained from the Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9 intestinal bacterial strains were presented at the first time. The highest activity of the enzyme was measured in the cell-free extracts (1.52 +/- 0.163 and 0.46 +/- 0.044 U x mg-1 protein for D. piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9, respectively) compared to other fractions. The specific activity of acetate kinase in the extracts of both bacterial strains was determined at different temperature and pH. Analysis of the kinetic properties of the purified acetate kinase was carried out. The acetate kinase activity, initial (instantaneous) reaction rate (V0) and maximum rate of the acetate kinase reaction (Vmax) in D. piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9 intestinal bacterial strains were defined. Michaelis constants (KmAcetyl phosphate and KmADP) of the enzyme reaction (2.54 +/- 0.26 and 2.39 +/- 0.24 mM for D. piger Vib-7 as well as 2.68 +/- 0.25 and 2.47 +/- 0.27 mM for Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9, respectively) were calculated. The described results of acetate kinase, an important enzyme in the process of organic compounds oxidation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction would be perspective and useful for clarification of the etiological role of these bacteria in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases in humans and animals.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of desulfovibrios in the human distal colon of healthy, colorectal cancer and polypectomized individuals.
AB  - The production of hydrogen sulphide, an end product of metabolism by the sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) has been cited as a potential aetiological agent in gastrointestinal disease. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assays to enumerate desulfovibrios from two gastrointestinal disease groups: colorectal cancer (CRC) n=27 and polypectomized individuals (PP) n=27, and two healthy control groups, elderly (H1) n=8 and young adults (H2) n=30 was performed. Analysis of Desulfovibrio sp. diversity using the dissimilarity sulphite reductase (dsrAB) gene as a molecular marker was also undertaken. Q-PCR detected Desulfovibrio sp. in all samples and no significant difference was observed for PP, H1, H2 with gene copy numbers of Desulfovibrio sp. averaging at 10(6) g(-1) of faeces. Significantly reduced numbers of Desulfovibrio sp. were observed for CRC (10(5) g(-1)) compared with both PP and H2 groups (P<0.05). Diversity analysis indicated that a low Desulfovibrio sp. diversity and the predominance of Desulfovibrio piger was a feature of both healthy and disease groups. In addition, a dsrAB gene sequence distantly related to a Gram-positive SRB was also recovered, highlighting the importance of cultivation-independent techniques for furthering our understanding of the diversity of the human gastrointestinal ecosystem.
