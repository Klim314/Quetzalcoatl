TI  == [isolation, identification and naringin biotransforming properties of naringinase producing bacteria isolated from human intestinal microflora].
AB  == objective: isolation of specific bacteria from human intestinal microflora to convert naringin to naringenin efficiently. methods: fresh human feces from healthy individual was cultured in an anaerobic chamber for 24 h before being diluted and spread on agar medium. we cultured and incubated each single colony with the substrate naringin. the biotransformation of naringin by each single colony was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). we identified the isolated bacteria based on the analyses of 16s rdna sequence and biochemical traits. we also studied the bioconversion kinetics of the bacteria. results: four bacterial strains, named auh-jld3, auh-jld7, auh-jld104 and auh-jld109, capable of biotransforming naringin to naringenin, were isolated and  identified as blautia sp. auh-jld3, enterococcus sp. auh-jld7, bacteroides sp. auh-jld104 and streptococcus pasteurianus subsp. auh-jld109 respectively based on the 16s rdna sequence analysis, bacterial cell morphology, and biochemical traits. study on biotransforming kinetics showed that all the four isolated bacterial strains were able to convert naringin (0.2 mmol/l) to naringenin within 12 h. the maximal concentration of the substrate naringin that strain auh-jld3, strain auh-jld7, strain auh-jld104 and strain auh-jld109 could biotransform efficiently were 0. 2 mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 66. 67%), 0.8  mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 86.49%), 0. 2 mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 73.68%) and 1.6 mmol/l (the average biotransforming rate was 93.20%), respectively. conclusion: the four bacterial strains were capable of biotransforming naringin to naringenin, among which streptococcus pasteurianus subsp. auh-jld109 has the highest naringin biotransforming capacity.

TI  == time-dependent post mortem changes in the composition of intestinal bacteria using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == post mortem or even normal changes during life occurring in major gut bacterial populations are not known. we investigated bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp.,  clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea ratios in 7 fecal samples from healthy volunteers and in 61 autopsies rectum and cecum samples and studied the effect of post mortem time  using quantitative real-time pcr. bacterial ratios in stool samples from volunteers and rectum samples from autopsy cases were similar and did not change  significantly up to 5 days post mortem. in cecum, significant post mortem time-dependent differences were observed in ratios of bacteroides sp. (p = 0.014) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.024). our results showed that ratios of bacteroides  sp., bifidobacterium sp., clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea can be investigated in autopsy rectum samples up to 5 days after death.

TI  == green-lipped mussel extract (perna canaliculus) and glucosamine sulphate in patients with knee osteoarthritis: therapeutic efficacy and effects on gastrointestinal microbiota profiles.
AB  == objective: to investigate how changes in the gastrointestinal tract (git) microbiota profile may influence nutraceutical efficacy in osteoarthritis (oa) and allow the formulation of a hypothesis that explains in part the inconsistent  and contentious findings from oa clinical studies with green-lipped mussel (glm)  and glucosamine. methods: a non-blinded randomised clinical trial was conducted with 38 subjects diagnosed with knee oa. each participant received either 3,000 mg/day of a whole glm extract or 3,000 mg/day of glucosamine sulphate (gs), p.o.  for 12 weeks. faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools  at t (0) and t (12) weeks. additional pharmacometric measures were obtained from  changes in arthritic scores in the western ontario mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) and the lequesne algofunctional indices and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (gsrs). an intention-to-treat analysis was  employed and participant data collected at t (0), t (6) and t (12) weeks. results: there were no statistically significant changes in bacterial growth patterns determined by the wilcoxon test. in both groups there was a trend towards a decrease in clostridium and staphylococcus species and increase in lactobacillus, streptococcus and eubacterium species. in the glm group bifidobacterium tended to increase and enterococcus and yeast species to decrease. the gs-treated group demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in bacteroides and an increase in yeasts and coliforms species, most notably escherichia coli. we further confirm significant improvement (p < 0.05) in all oa outcome measures from t (0) to t (12) weeks for both the glm and gs groups. the gsrs scores indicated that git function significantly improved over the 12 weeks  duration with glm and gs supplementation. conclusion: both glm and gs reduced oa  symptoms and non-significantly altered the gut microbiota profile from baseline.  changes in the microbiota profiles occurred in both treatment groups; the most notable being a reduction in the clostridia sp. this study suggests that nutritional supplements such as glm and gs may regulate some of the metabolic and immunological activities of the git microbiota. the decrease in clostridia, a potent modulator of colonic th17 and cd4+ regulatory t cells, was consistent with a decrease in inflammation; improved gsrs scores and oa symptoms for these oa participants. the git microbiota may be important factor in the first-pass metabolism of these nutraceuticals.

TI  == levels of selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == influence of long-term consumption of a lactococcus lactis strain on the intestinal immunity and intestinal flora of the senescence-accelerated mouse.
AB  == the senescence-accelerated mouse develops normally until 5-6 months of age and then displays rapid and irreversible advancement of senescence manifesting as clinical signs and gross lesions. to clarify the effect of lactic acid bacteria on the physiological changes with increasing age, heat-killed lactococcus lactis  g50 was administered to 1-month-old senescence-accelerated-prone mouse (samp)6 mice for 11 months, a senescence-accelerated mouse strain that develops senile osteoporosis. mice fed g50 gained more weight than the control mice (not fed g50) during the feeding experiment. faecal iga levels in the mice fed g50 at 3 months  were higher than those of the control mice but decreased to control levels with increasing age. the numbers of viable cells of bacteroides sp., lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., enterococcus/streptococcus sp. and enterobacteriaceae sp. in faeces were similar for mice fed the g50 and control diets at any age, but strain g50 suppressed the intestinal growth of h2s-producing bacteria. bone density of the thigh bone did not differ between aged g50 and control mice. strain g50 would be a beneficial bacterium for the enhancement of intestinal immunity during youth and to suppress the growth of harmful intestinal bacteria.  the applicability of strain g50 for the food and animal industries has been proposed in the present study.

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == etiology of persistent tubo-ovarian abscess in nairobi, kenya.
AB  == objective: to study the microbial etiology of tubo-ovarian abscess (toa). methods: we recruited 11 women in nairobi, kenya who failed antibiotic therapy alone and required surgical drainage of a presumptive toa. pus from the nine abscesses and two pyosalpinges were collected and cultured for aerobic, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. results: eleven women suspected of having a toa were hospitalized and treated for a median of 6 days (range 3-14 days) prior to surgical drainage of the abscess. nine (82%) specimens were culture positive. aerobes were present in all nine specimens. seven of the nine positive cultures (78%) were polymicrobial and five of the polymicrobial cultures contained both anaerobes and aerobes. anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (prevotella sp., porphyromonas sp. and bacteroides sp., escherichia coli) and streptococcus sp. (s. viridans and s. agalactiae) were the most common microorganisms isolated. neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis were not isolated by culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction. conclusions: in kenya, persistent toas are associated with endogenous flora similar to that normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

TI  == immune response in chronic periapical parodonititis.
AB  == the purpose of our study was to investigate the immune response in chronical periapical parodontitis (cpp) by using multidisciplinary approach. 30 cpp samples were obtained after surgical removal--apicoectomy. each cpp sample was examined by histological, bacteriological and flow cytometrical (fc) analysis of lymphocytes infiltrating cpp samples. ten percent of bacteriological samples were sterile, others had significant aerobic and anaerobic growth. we used pathohistologic and microbiologic findings and compared them to the results of immunological analysis. by fc we found a significant increase in proportions of t lymphocytes expressing interleukin-2 receptors and icam-1 compared to peripheral  blood lymphocytes. proportions of t helper cells that produce interferon-gama (ifn-gamma) was higher in cpp samples predominantly colonized by anaerobic bacteria. there were no differences in il-4 expression by t cells in both groups  (anaerobic and streptococcal). among anaerobic cpp samples differences in proportion of t cells that express il-2 receptors expression was also found between samples colonised by p. acnes and bacteroides sp. oral streptococci cause relatively limited tissue destruction and induce th2 type of immune response accompanied by non-cytotoxic inflammatory reaction. on the contrary, anaerobic bacteria induce th1 type of immune response that cause more severe inflammatory reaction (type 4) of hypersensitivity that damage the tissue by the action of cytotoxic t cell activation.

TI  == antibiotic therapy attenuates colitis in interleukin 10 gene-deficient mice.
AB  == background & aims: interleukin (il)-10 gene-deficient mice, raised under germfree conditions, do not develop colitis, implying a role for bacteria. this study mapped the appearance of luminal colonic bacteria and, using antibiotic treatment, determined their association with colitis in il-10 gene-deficient mice. methods: mice were treated with ciprofloxacin or with neomycin and metronidazole. the intestine was harvested for histological scoring and bacterial assessment. results: at 2 weeks of age, before the development of colitis, il-10  gene-deficient mice demonstrated an earlier appearance of streptococcus and clostridium sp., and had a greater proportion (p < 0.01) of bacteria adherent to  the colonic mucosa. this pattern of increased adherent bacteria persisted for the 12 weeks of study. treatment of mice before the onset of colonic inflammation, with either antibiotic regime, reduced mucosal adherent bacteria and prevented colitis (p < 0.01). in contrast, treatment of established colitis with neomycin and metronidazole did not reduce adherent bacterial levels, yet was more efficacious (p < 0.05) in treating established colitis than ciprofloxacin, which  did reduce adherent colonic bacteria. conclusions: in the il-10 gene-deficient mouse model, the appearance and number of mucosal adherent colonic bacteria are altered before the onset of colitis. antibiotics both prevent and treat the colitis through correction of this primary bacterial alteration.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

AB  == the post-partum intrauterine bacterial flora, prostaglandin release, uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity were studied in 9 swedish dairy cows during the first 8-week period. uterine involution was monitored by transrectal examinations of the reproductive tract 3 times weekly. bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. the main pgf2 alpha metabolite (15-ketodihydro-pgf2 alpha) was monitored from twice daily blood plasma samples, while morning samples were used for progesterone determinations. the cows were assigned to 2 groups: group i (n = 7) with an uncomplicated puerperal period and group ii (n = 2) with signs of intrauterine infections. a total of 143 biopsies were collected, of which 129 (90.2%) were found to be bacteriologically negative. thirteen (9.1%) of the remaining 14 biopsies were bacteriologically positive, while one (0.7%) was probably a contamination on a single occasion. the 13 bacteriologically positive biopsies belonged to the group ii cows from which 31 isolates contained 6 different genera of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. actinomyces pyogenes along with bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium necrophorum were found to predominate in a mixed flora. the bacteria were rapidly eliminated and disappeared completely from the uteri towards the end of the third week post-partum. the average number of days required for completion of uterine involution was 21.8 +/- 3.0 for all animals. the plasma levels of the pgf2 alpha metabolite were significantly elevated for the first 12-18, and 18 and 27 days in group i and group ii, respectively. there was no significant relationship between the duration of pgf2  alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution (p > 0.05). progesterone analysis showed resumption of ovarian activity and subsequent ovulation in 4 of the 9 cows 44-55 days post-partum. thus, intrauterine infections are not commonly seen in cows with normal calving and comparison between the duration of pgf2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution showed insignificant correlation. however, the longer duration of pgf2 alpha release recorded in the 2 cows with intrauterine infections are related to the increased frequency of infections.

TI  == breast abscesses in nigeria: lactational versus non-lactational.
AB  == this review of 299 cases of breast abscesses seen over a 10-year period (1981-1990) at the university of calabar teaching hospital in nigeria seeks to establish the current status of breast abscesses in the tropics. lactational breast abscess constitutes 95% of breast abscesses while non-lactational breast abscess constitutes only 5% in this review. the commonest pathogen cultured from  lactational breast abscess is staphylococcus aureus and the disease responds to incision and drainage and systemic antibiotics, while non-lactational breast abscess is caused mostly by anaerobic organisms, usually with underlying mammary  duct ectasia. the low incidence of non-lactational breast abscess corresponds to  the low incidence of cigarette smoking and mammary duct ectasia in nigerian women. while the high incidence of lactational breast abscess corresponds to the  high rate of breast feeding and low level of personal hygiene in the low income group nigerian women in which the disease is commonest. economic recession has also reduced patronage of artificial feeds thus intensifying breast feeding and consequent lactational breast abscess.

AB  == we performed transtracheal aspiration (tta) in 1165 patients, who were suspected  to have bronchopulmonary infection, from december 1978 to march 1993. we isolated pathogens from tta in 806 patients (69.2%). we isolated h. influenzae (62 cases), s. pneumoniae (39 cases) and m. catarrhalis (24 cases) in patients with acute bronchitis, s. pneumoniae (65 cases), alpha-streptococcus sp. (52 cases), h. influenzae (32 cases) and s. aureus (29 cases) in patients with pneumonia or lung abscess and h. influenzae (174 cases), s. pneumoniae (84 cases), p. aeruginosa (81 cases) and m. catarrhalis (42 cases) in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. anaerobic bacteria isolated from tta included peptostreptococcus sp. (19 cases), bacteroides sp. (19 cases) and others. mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated from tta in 8 patients with pneumonia without  other organisms. virus isolated from tta included rhinovirus (6 cases) and others. these results suggest that various pathogens affect the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infection. therefore, we must diagnose the bronchopulmonary infection by the correct methods such as tta.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == microbiological studies of abscesses complicating bothrops snakebite in humans: a prospective study.
AB  == forty patients with abscesses at the site of bothrops bite were evaluated. ten brought the snake responsible for the bite, bothrops jararaca in all cases. on admission a sample was collected from each case for aerobic and anaerobic culture, and no abscesses drained spontaneously. none of the patients had received antibacterial therapy at this time. the bacteria most frequently isolated were morganella morganii (23 patients), providencia rettgeri (7) enterobacter sp. (4), escherichia coli (3), group d streptococcus (11) and bacteroides sp. (6). all enterobacteria tested were sensitive to chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and cefotaxime. group d streptococci were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and penicillin g, whereas anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. these results suggest that in cases of abscess formation secondary to bothrops bite, chloramphenicol alone is a good choice, being both safe and cheap.

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. the antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to actinobacillus sp., p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia in that order. in general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. however, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. in addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. these findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. these included high levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 in ljp and rpp subjects and to  a. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in ljp and gjp subjects.

TI  == retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  == necrotizing fasciitis is a mixed infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues with a characteristic clinical and pathological appearance. early radical surgical excision of all affected tissue is the treatment of choice. in a series  of 19 patients with necrotizing fasciitis, bacteriological assessment in 15 confirmed the mixed nature of the infection, with bacteroides sp. isolated from ten patients. all 12 patients who underwent radical surgical excision survived. a subgroup of patients was identified in whom the appearance of necrotizing fasciitis in the abdomen or perineum was indicative of more extensive disease in  the retroperitoneal tissues. surgical resection of all affected tissue was not feasible in these cases and the outcome was uniformly fatal, giving an overall mortality rate for the series of 37 per cent.

TI  == [clinico-statistical study on pyometra in high-aged outpatients].
AB  == we clinico-statistically studied outpatients with pyometra aged 60 or older who visited our outpatient clinic during the past four years. 1. pyometra was diagnosed in 48 cases (13.6%) of 353 in which the uterine cavity could be examined. the incidence became significantly higher with age (p less than 0.01).  2. thirty-two patients with pyometra were found to require a wheelchair or to be  in an immobilized state (bedridden). these patients with poor activity in daily living amounted to 76.2% of 42 cases which were not a complication of malignant uterine tumor or tuberculous endometritis. 3. pyometra was diagnosed in 29 patients of 96 with urinary and/or rectal incontinence (30.2%). this incidence was significantly higher than that in our patients without incontinence (5.5%) (p less than 0.01). 4. hematological and blood chemistry study revealed abnormality  of the peripheral leucocyte count in 34.5% and crp abnormality in 70.4% of all the cases of pyometra. 5. mixed infection by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria  was observed in 16 cases of 36 in which strain could be determined by pus culture. streptococcus sp. and bacteroides sp. were predominant as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, respectively. the present study on pyometra cases of aged people demonstrated that poor activity in daily living and incontinence were significant factors causing this disease. it also revealed the various features of pyometra in aged people.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == studies on the possible role of cattle nuisance flies, especially hydrotaea irritans, in the transmission of summer mastitis in denmark.
AB  == the summer mastitis pathogens actinomyces pyogenes, peptococcus indolicus, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii, fusobacterium necrophorum and streptococcus dysgalactiae were isolated from the polyphagous symbovine dipterans hydrotaea irritans (fallen) and morellia sp. caught around dairy heifers on pasture, but not from the haematophagous species haematobia irritans (l.), haematobosca stimulans (meigen), culicoides sp. and simulium sp. secretions from  clinical cases of summer mastitis proved to be sources of summer mastitis bacteria for more than 3 weeks despite antibiotic treatment and teat amputation.  taking into account the seasonal activity pattern of hydrotaea irritans and its topographical distribution on grazing cattle, it appears evident that this fly may play a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the bacterial contamination with summer mastitis pathogens on the teats of healthy cattle. in the present study the survival of a.pyogenes and p.indolicus for 7 days in experimentally infected hydrotaea irritans, as demonstrated by the recovery of these microorganisms from agar plates exposed to live infected flies, is described. however, experimental transmission of summer mastitis from sick to healthy heifers by hydrotaea irritans proved unsuccessful.

TI  == use of gas liquid chromatography as an adjunct to conventional bacteriological methods in the diagnosis of anaerobic cerebral abscess.
AB  == forty cases of cerebral abscesses were studied prospectively to establish the microbial agents implicated in these cases. chronic otitis media (14 patients, 35%), congenital heart disease (five patients, 12.5%),a and meningitis (five patients, 12.5%) were among the important predisposing factors. streptococcus (14 patients, 35%) was the most common causative pre-isolated, the predominant species being streptococcus milleri (11 patients, 27.5%). other organisms isolated included proteus mirabilis in six patients (15%) and staphylococcus aureus in five patients (12.5%). anaerobes (12 patients, 30%), predominantly bacteroides sp. (eight patients, 20%), played an important role in these cases, the majority of which were isolated in mixed cultures. gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of pus detected the presence of anaerobes in another 11 cases of cerebral abscess, in which cultures of anaerobes were negative. therefore, gas-liquid chromotography is useful as an adjunct to conventional bacteriological methods in providing a rapid and sensitive means of detecting anaerobes in pus obtained especially from patients who had received antibiotic therapy prior to hospitalization.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. as a matter of fact it has been  proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation  (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). on the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved.  in endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. the most frequently found obligate anaerobes are bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. (gram- rods) anaerobic diphtheroides (gram+ rods) peptostreptococcus sp. (gram+ cocci) and veilonella sp. (gram- cocci). actinomyces sp., lactobacillus sp., streptococcus sp., and staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  == imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. to test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several medical centers in brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding mic were  carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of s. paulo, rio de janeiro and salvador. our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this  country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding mic correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == pig bite injuries and infection: report of seven human cases.
AB  == six patients developed local infection after being bitten or gored by swine. wounding was often deep and occurred characteristically on the posterior aspect of the thigh. severity of infection varied from simple wound infection with discharge and slough to cellulitis and abscess formation; pathogens included haemolytic streptococci, pasteurellae, bacteroides sp., proteus sp. and escherichia coli and were usually isolated in mixed culture. a patient with pasteurella aerogenes infection appears to be the first reported in england. a seventh patient developed streptococcus milleri septicaemia after wounding himself while cutting teeth from piglets. it is suggested that a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given as part of the initial treatment when  patients present with the more severe pig bite injuries.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. the sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. all clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. the combination of f. nucleatum, b. forsyth and w. recta (cluster vii) or b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and s. intermedius (cluster viii) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. these clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. clusters dominated by v. parvula (cluster iii), the actinomyces sp. (cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". the predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. among the 33 subjects, w. recta, b. intermedius, f. nucleatum, b. gingivalis and b. forsythus  were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, s. mitis, c. ochracea, s. sanguis ii, v. parvula and an unnamed actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. the likelihood of a site being active was increased if b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, w. recta, or b. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if s. sanguis ii, the actinomyces sp., or c. ochracea were detected.

AB  == we studied the microbial flora of tonsils removed from 20 children who suffered from recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) tonsillitis and 20 who had tonsillar hypertrophy following recurrent non-gabhs tonsillitis. similar  polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora were recovered from the cores of the tonsils in each group. beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were recovered more often in the group with gabhs. this difference was due mostly to the lower incidence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of branhamella catarrhalis and bacteroides sp in hypertrophic tonsils following non-gabhs tonsillitis. beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus was found with equal frequency in  both groups. these findings demonstrate that although blpb are recovered more often in recurrently inflamed tonsils following gabhs infection, blpb also can be found in hypertrophic tonsils following non-gabhs tonsillitis.

AB  == establishment of a specific pathogen-free (spf) rabbit colony was attempted by transferring a total of 127 hysterectomy-derived rabbits directly into a barrier  room where spf rats had been reared. all rabbits except four died of mucoid enteritis-like diarrhea during 2 and 6 weeks of age. a second experiment consisted of four groups of hysterectomy-derived rabbits including: (1) noninoculated controls; (2) rabbits inoculated with suspension of feces from the  survivors; (3) rabbits inoculated with a bacterial inoculum (bacteroides spp. and eubacterium sp. isolated from conventional rabbits); and (4) rabbits inoculated with streptococcus faecalis in addition to the inoculum used for group 3. all rabbits in group 1 died of diarrhea by 3 weeks of age. survival rates of groups 2, 3 and 4 are 53%, 38% and 40%, respectively. on 7 days after the inoculation, bacteroides was not recovered from fecal samples of group 1, but was recovered from many samples of the inoculated groups. populations of enterobacteriaceae and clostridium in the samples in group 1 were larger than each of those in the inoculated groups. the present results suggest that the lethal diarrhea, after transferring hysterectomy-derived animals directly into a barrier room, can be controlled by inoculation with non-pathogenic anaerobes, especially bacteroides.

TI  == antimicrobial substance from a human lactobacillus strain.

AB  == the in vitro activities of two new oral cephalosporins, ro 19-5247 and ro 15-8074, were compared with the in vitro activities of cefuroxime, cefaclor, amoxicillin-clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smz), and doxycycline against a variety of bacterial species. mic50s (mics required to inhibit 50% of strains) of ro 19-5247 were less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml for streptococci (except streptococcus faecalis) and haemophilus influenzae; 0.25 to  2 micrograms/ml for most strains of enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila, branhamella catarrhalis, and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria; and 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. mic50s of ro 15-8074 were similar to those of ro 19-5247, except that gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes were less susceptible. both ro 19-5247 and ro 15-8074 had greater in vitro activity against strains of enterobacteriaceae than did comparative beta-lactams and doxycycline; tmp-smz had the broadest spectrum of activity against these organisms. none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, s. faecalis, most nonfermenters, or bacteroides sp. inoculum size variations affected mics in a species-dependent manner for beta-lactams and unpredictably for tmp-smz but had little effect for doxycycline. bactericidal activity was consistent with beta-lactams, inconsistent with tmp-smz, and uncommon with doxycycline.

TI  == anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  == twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. the etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. the predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), bacteroides sp. (21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

AB  == retrospective review of the notes of 83 peritonsillar infection sufferers over three years at christchurch hospital reveals that the typical sufferer is a young adult male who is most likely to present in winter or summer. only a quarter of the patients had a significant recent history of tonsillitis but four had had a previous quinsy and six had had a previous tonsillectomy in childhood. length of  symptoms does not appear helpful in differentiating an abscess from a cellulitis. anaerobic organisms were found in 49% of aspirates and streptococci were the most important aerobic organism. potential beta lactamase producing organisms, h influenzae, staph aureus and bacteroides sp were infrequent and penicillin remains the drug of choice. appropriate antibiotics and drainage are the essentials of management and tonsillectomy may be indicated.

AB  == fundamental and clinical studies of a new carbapenem antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk-0787/mk-0791), were carried out to evaluate the drug in treating infections of the female genital organs. the following results were obtained: in 4 patients undergoing hysterectomy, the penetration of mk-0787  and mk-0791 into female genital organ tissues was studied following a 30-minute intravenous drip infusion of mk-0787/mk-0791 500 mg/500 mg. plasma levels of mk-0787 and mk-0791 in cubital venous blood following the drip infusion peaked at 0 minute with values of 51.2 micrograms/ml and 61.9 micrograms/ml, respectively,  then decreased to 1.9 micrograms/ml and 0.7 microgram/ml, respectively, at 201 minutes. mk-0787 penetrated readily to female genital organ tissues and levels of the drug exceeded 0.5 approximately 1.9 micrograms/g in various organ tissues at  201 minutes following an intravenous drip infusion of 500 mg/500 mg of mk-0787/mk-0791. clinically, mk-0787/mk-0791 was used for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections at a dosage of 500 mg/500 mg twice daily by intravenous drip infusion. clinical effects of mk-0787/mk-0791 were analyzed in 22 patients, including 9 patients with intrauterine infections, 7 with intrapelvic infections, 5 with adnexitis, and 1 with an external genital infection. excellent responses were seen in 5 patients (22.7%), good responses in 15 (68.2%), and poor responses in 2 (9.1%). the efficacy ratio was 90.9%. after the treatment, 15 out of 18 isolates were eradicated for an 83.3% eradication rate. all strains of s. epidermidis (2 strains), eubacterium lentum (1 strain), peptococcus sp. (1 strain), beta-streptococcus (1 strain), gram-positive rods (2  strains), enterobacter cloacae (1 strain), bacteroides bivius (1 strain), pseudomonas sp. (1 strain), pseudomonas cepacia (1 strain) and gram-negative rods (1 strain) were eradicated by the mk-0787/mk-0791 treatment. the safety of the drug was analyzed in 22 patients, effects occurred in 3 (13.6%). among those 3 patients, diarrhea occurred in 1 patient, rash in another and nausea and vomiting in yet another. one patient had an increased bun after the mk-0787/mk-0791 treatment. in the other 21 patients, no abnormalities in creatinine, got, gpt, or t. bil. values were observed. it may be concluded that mk-0787/mk-0791 is useful  for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections.

TI  == evaluation of selective media for primary isolation of treponema hyodysenteriae and treponema innocens.
AB  == a total of 2450 samples of feces, intestinal contents and colon mucosal scrapings were bacteriologically examined. a total of 53 strains of treponema sp. were isolated, and 45 strains of bacteroides sp., 30 strains of e. coli, 30 strains of micrococcus sp. and 10 strains of streptococcus d isolates were randomly selected. growth promoting studies showed statistically significant stimulation of treponema sp. growth by yeast extract, chicken egg yolk and rumen fluid. different growth inhibitors were also tested. for selective medium the following  inhibitors were selected: spectinomycin, colistin, vancomycin, brilliant green. optimal concentrations of these inhibitors in the medium were determined. finally tsa medium supplemented with 0.05% yeast extract, 5% bovine blood, 0.01% dtt, 400 micrograms spectinomycin, and 250 micrograms/ml vancomycin, appeared to be optimal selective medium for intestinal treponema sp. isolation. quantitative studies showed that the number of treponema c.f.u. on songers et al. medium with  spectinomycin and on spectinomycin-vancomycin medium, did not differ significantly. the number of overgrowing bacteria was statistically significantly lower on spectinomycin-vancomycin medium, than songers et al. selective medium with spectinomycin. the tsa supplemented with blood, yeast extract 50 micrograms/ml of colistin and 1 microgram/ml of brilliant green was less selective than spectinomycin-vancomycin medium and inhibited some strains of treponema sp. in the case of spectinomycin-vancomycin resistant of overgrowing bacteria, colistin-brilliant green medium may be suitable for isolation of treponema sp.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == infection and the use of antibiotics in crohn's disease.
AB  == many patients with crohn's disease present with the complications of infection. hence, antibiotics play an important role in the medical management of acute inflammatory disease, persistent perianal disease and as prophylaxis for surgical operations. the author's group has demonstrated that bacteria colonize the serosa of the bowel in patients with crohn's disease in 27% of cases. furthermore, pathogenic bacteria could be recovered from the lymph nodes in 33% of patients with crohn's disease, compared with only 5% in a controlled population. extraintestinal bacterial colonization was, therefore, present in approximately half of all patients requiring an operation for crohn's disease. the principal bacteria isolated at these sites were escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, proteus sp and diphtheroids. a prospective controlled trial on the use of 1 month's antimicrobial therapy in patients with relapse of crohn's disease revealed that metronidazole was associated with a 57% response rate, compared with a response of only 17% in patients receiving no metronidazole. these interim findings suggest that metronidazole may have a role in the management of acute relapse in patients with crohn's disease.

AB  == the prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. the study involved 147 friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. all herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. no anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. only anaerobes were present in  10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. a variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. peptococcus spp. was associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and bacteroides spp. with staphylococcus aureus and/or streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-g but all the gram negative rods were resistant. in addition, all b. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. the ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain  of peptococcus indolicus and a peptostreptococcus sp.

TI  == recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  == l-phase (cwd) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) type b cwd variants in equally low numbers. organisms in group 1 were: streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci,  lancefield gp. g (2x); staphylococcus aureus; actinobacillus, and actinomyces viscosus. group 2 consisted of bacteroides sp., propionibacterium acnes, and three "nocardia-like" sp. catalase + actinomyces was not recovered equally well on cwd plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. this occurred in spite of the fact that the cwd media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced l-phase variants of nocardia caviae and n. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a bacteroides l-phase variant from a pleural fluid. the nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.

TI  == bacteremia in diabetic patients with infected lower extremities.
AB  == eleven cases of bacteremia in diabetic patients with infected lower extremities at rancho los amigos hospital (rlah) were observed over a 34-mo period. the yearly incidence was 0.6% of admissions to the ortho-diabetes service. aerobic bacteria were recovered in six cases and anaerobic bacteria in five. bacteroides  fragilis was isolated four times, staphylococcus aureus three times, and nonfragilis bacteroides sp., escherichia coli, group b streptococcus, and viridans streptococcus were each seen once. ten of the 11 patients were febrile at the time of bacteremia. clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and ultrasonographic parameters were comparable in patients with aerobic and anaerobic bacteremia, and between bacteremic patients and nonbacteremic controls. fever, however, was significantly more frequent in bacteremic patients. foul-smelling lesions were seen in two of the five patients with anaerobic bacteremia, and in none of the patients with aerobic bacteremia. postoperative b. fragilis bacteremia was observed to be transient and resolved without definitive therapy in one patient.  appropriate antibiotic therapy in 10 patients together with surgical intervention in eight cases resulted in resolution of the infection in the remaining patients.

TI  == bacteremia in obstetrics: clinical course.
AB  == the authors reviewed all documented cases of bacteremia in obstetric patients between 1975 and 1979, with emphasis on the clinical course. the incidence of bacteremia was 7.5:1000 obstetric admissions and 9.7% of those patients sampled.  one hundred seventy-six bacteremic obstetric patients had the following diagnoses: endoparametritis (123), pyelonephritis (29), chorioamnionitis (14), and other (10). no deaths, clinical evidence of septic shock, or cases of postinfection endocarditis were found. the most common bloodstream isolates were  escherichia coli (57), group b streptococcus (28), and bacteroides sp (26). the patients with endoparametritis had a fever index of 86.2 +/- 47.1f-hours, an average hospital stay of 6.5 +/- 3.1 days, a 7.3% rate of complications, and a 19.5% rate of failure of primary antibiotics. the patients with chorioamnionitis  had a fever index of 32.7 +/- 48.9f-hours and an average hospital stay of 4.8 +/- 2.3 days. these clinical measures are comparable with those in the general population with the same diagnoses at the authors' hospital. in this obstetric population, prompt, vigorous treatment rendered the clinical course of bacteremic patients with genital infections remarkably similar to that of nonbacteremic patients with the same kinds of infection.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

TI  == the upper vaginal and cervical anaerobic flora in menopausal women.
AB  == the upper vaginal and cervical bacterial flora, especially the anaerobic one which has a particular role in postoperative morbidity, was studied in 78 menopausal women between 48 and 78 yr of age. the aim of the present study was to compare the results obtained with those reported for bacterial flora in women of  other age groups. the patients were divided into the following 3 groups. (i) twenty-eight healthy women with a natural menopause; (ii) 30 women, 2-6 mth after surgical menopause due to panhysterectomy; and (iii) 20 menopausal women 3 mth after vaginal hysterectomy. 30.7% of the cultures were found to be sterile. the anaerobic bacteria, developed only in the presence of aerobic germs, represented  11.5% of the total number of cultures and was found to be formed by streptococcus bacteroides sp. and bacteroides fragilis. the vaginal flora of menopausal women is not different from that found in children, young women, in pregnancy or postpartum. the anaerobic germs isolated in our study are normal inhabitants of the vagina and cervix which may occasionally become pathogens.

TI  == isolation and significance of anaerobic bacteria isolated from cases of bovine mastitis.
AB  == the role of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the aetiology of mastitis of lactating dairy cows was investigated. anaerobes were isolated from 12% of lactating mastitic cows, which were representative of 50% of the 10 dairy herds examined. bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently isolated organism of (50%), followed by peptococcus indolicus (33%), eubacterium lentum (33%), e. aerofaciens (17%), propionibacterium granulosum (17%) and an anaerobic streptococcus sp. (17%). these obligate anaerobes were always isolated together with organisms classically involved in mastitis. it was possible to induce overt clinical mastitis in healthy lactating udders within 24 hours by infection with single pure cultures of anaerobes via the teat canal. all b. fragilis strains were resistant to penicillin g and tetracycline. in addition, one strain was also resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin and amoxicillin. anaerobic gram positive cocci and bacilli were sensitive to most antibiotics. these findings imply an important role for anaerobes in the aetiology of mastitis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). a total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). a total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). the predominant aerobic isolates were s. epidermidis, s. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas sp., and group d streptococcus. the predominant anaerobic isolates were: p. acnes, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bacteroides sp. blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: s. aureus, e. coli, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and b. fragilis. the numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). gram-negative enteric rods and group d streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and p. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. all children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. these data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.

(10,  including two b. fragilis); fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and actinomyces sp. (five isolates). a total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five gram-positive cocci and three haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. five patients, four with  sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not  respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

(including b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis), fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and veillonella sp. there were 138 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (group a, b, c, and f), s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and hemophilus sp. hemophilus influenzae type b, and s. aureus were more frequently isolated in group a. b. fragilis was only recovered in group a. beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. fifteen of these patients belonged to group a (83% of group a), while 3 were members of group b (25% of group b). these bacteria were all isolates of s. aureus (11) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 b. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 b. oralis, and two of 8 h. influenza type b. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.

AB  == the bacterial flora of non-inflamed maxillary sinuses were studied in 12 adults.  patients' median age was 35 years (range 25 to 53 years): 8 were females and 4 were males. aseptic aspiration of the sinus was made when the patients were under general anaesthesia for corrective plastic surgery of the nasal septum. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. anaerobes were isolated in all 12 specimen patients; in 5 patients (42%), they were the only organisms isolated, and in 7 (58%), they were recovered mixed with aerobes. there were 33 anaerobic isolates (2.75 pr specimen) and the predominant ones were: 11 bacteroides sp. (including 6 b. melaninogenicus), 10 anaerobic gram-positive cocci and 5 fusobacterium sp. there were 16 aerobic isolates (1.3 per specimen) and the predominant ones were: 5 beta hemolytic streptococci, 3 alpha hemolytic streptococci, and 2 each of s. pneumoniae and hemophilus parainfluenzae. beta lactamase production was noted in 4 isolates recovered from 3 patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus (2) and 2 of 6 isolates of b. melaninogenicus. the presence of aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the non-inflamed sinus demonstrates the non-sterility of the sinus cavity. in the events that follow closure of the sinus ostium, these bacteria may become pathogenic.

TI  == uric acid-degrading bacteria in guts of termites [reticulitermes flavipes (kollar)].
AB  == uricolytic bacteria were present in guts of reticulitermes flavipes in populations up to 6 x 10 cells per gut. of 82 strains isolated under strict anaerobic conditions, most were group n streptococcus sp., bacteroides termitidis, and citrobacter sp. all isolates used uric acid (ua) as an energy source anaerobically, but not aerobically, and nh(3) was the major nitrogenous product of uricolysis. however, none of the isolates had an absolute requirement  for ua. utilization of heterocyclic compounds other than ua was limited. fresh termite gut contents also degraded ua anaerobically, as measured by co(2) evolution from [2-c]ua. the magnitude of anaerobic uricolysis [0.67 pmol of ua catabolized/(gut x h)] was entirely consistent with the population density of uricolytic bacteria in situ. uricolytic gut bacteria may convert ua in situ to products usable by termites for carbon, nitrogen, energy, or all three. this possibility is consistent with the fact that r. flavipes termites from ua, but they do not void the purine in excreta despite the lack of uricase in their tissues.

TI  == cross-feeding of lactate between streptococcus lactis and bacteroides sp. isolated from termite hindguts.
AB  == streptococcus lactis and bacteroides sp., isolated from hindguts of reticulitermes flavipes termites, were grown anaerobically in monoculture and coculture. when grown in a glucose medium, s. lactis monoculture produced lactate as the major fermentation product, with small amounts of formate, acetate, ethanol, and co(2). in coculture, glucose was completely consumed during growth of s. lactis. lactate, produced by s. lactis, then supported much of the growth of bacteroides and was fermented to propionate, acetate, and co(2). small amounts of succinate were formed during growth of bacteroides in the coculture, but little change in the formate or ethanol concentration was observed. monoculture growth of bacteroides in a tryptone-yeast extract medium revealed that incorporation of 20 to 40 mm lactate increased cell yields and production of organic acids. however, initial lactate concentrations greater than 40 mm suppressed not only growth of bacteroides but also acidic product formation. results suggest that cross-feeding of lactate between streptococci and bacteroides constitutes one aspect of the overall hindgut fermentation in termites.

TI  == bacteriology of human experimental gingivitis: effect of plaque and gingivitis score.
AB  == the plaque flora isolated from discrete dentogingival sites during a human gingivitis experiment was analyzed as a function of the plaque score and of the gingivitis score. when the gingivitis score was plotted as a function of the plaque score, a nonbleeding gingivitis was associated with a proportional increase in the actinomyces sp. at the expense of the streptococcus sp. in particular, the percentage of actinomyces israelii increased significantly, while the percent streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly. a. israelii also increased significantly when a bleeding gingivitis developed. when the plaque score was plotted as a function of the gingivitis score, a. israelii increased significantly as the nonbleeding gingivitis developed, but a. viscosus and bacteroides melaninogenicus increased significantly when the bleeding gingivitis  developed. the availability of a sufficient number of plaques with a plaque score of 2.0 permitted the examination of the interrelationship of gingivitis and flora minus the effect of plaque biomass. the bacteriological profile showed that when  bleeding occurred, the levels and proportions of a. viscosus and b. melaninogenicus increased significantly. these findings raise the possibility that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

AB  == various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin a (iga) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. the mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. the  strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, eubacterium, actinobacillus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, and clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones)  are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera  bacteroides and escherichia have an immunogenic effect. the same result was obtained with bacteroides and escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. the kinetics of appearance of intestinal iga plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. the association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal iga plasmocytes as that  obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. the maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. the orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, e. coli and bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.

TI  == monensin, eimeria tenella infection, and effects on the bacterial populations in  the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  == bacteria-free chicks in separate plastic film isolators were inoculated orally with single species of bacteria. within an isolator, half the birds were fed unmedicated feed and half received feed containing 100 ppm monensin. with clostridium perfringens as the established species of monoflora, bacterial counts from the duodenum were 10(4) times lower and counts from the ceca were three times lower in monensin-fed birds compared to unmedicated birds. infection with eimeria tenella stimulated an eight-fold increase in the numbers of c. perfringens in the ceca of unmedicated birds but no increase in monensin-fed birds. with bacteroides sp. or streptococcus faecalis as monoflora, there was no  difference in the cecal or duodenal populations between medicated and unmedicated birds uninfected with coccidia. in contrast to c. perfringens, populations of bacteroides sp. and s. faecalis in the ceca decreased five to 100-fold in both medicated and unmedicated chicks after infection with e. tenella. duodenal populations of c. perfringens, bacteroides sp., and s. faecalis were unaffected by the coccidial infection.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == quantitative microflora of the vagina.
AB  == this study enumerated the predominant vaginal flora in 25 healthy patients: 18 prenatal (six with and 12 without gonorrhea) and seven nonpregnant without gonorrhea. all 25 patients had aerobes and 19 of the 25 had anerobes isolated in  titers of greater than or equal to 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu per milliliter). the most frequently isolated microorganism was the lactobacillus (aerobic and anaerobic species) followed by c. vaginale, viridans streptococci, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bifidobacterium sp. bacteroides fragilis was not isolated. there were no significant differences in the frequency of isolation of any specific microorganism or bacterial counts between pregnant and nonpregnant women or between pregnant women with and without gonorrhea (p greater than 0.05), except pregnant patients had significantly higher total facultative counts associated with significantly lower anaerobic lactobacilli counts and higher c. vaginale counts (p less than 0.01) than in nonpregnant patients.

TI  == a simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.

TI  == competitive effects of intestinal microflora on vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the coexistence of vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. the bacteria tested included a bacteroides sp, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens type a, 2 separate isolates of escherichia coli, 2 different lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas maltophilia, and streptococcus faecalis. each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. no single strain or species was found that would eliminate v cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. not until a combination of e coli, p mirabilis, and  s faecalis was present in the mice did v cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.

TI  == puerperal endometritis: a prospective microbiologic study.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the flora in the endometrial cavity of two groups of puerperal patients: 47 afebrile control subjects and 27 with endometritis. a transcervical culturing technique designed to avoid cervical contamination and to preserve aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasma was employed, and bacterial colony counts were reported semiquantitatively. no difference was found in the flora of these two groups. furthermore, the most common pathogenic organisms (in decreasing order of frequency) were peptostreptococci, peptococci,  bacteroides sp., gamma-streptococci, enterococci, beta-streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and e. coli.
