TI  == biomineralization and formulation of endosulfan degrading bacterial and fungal consortiums.
AB  == microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove toxicants and in this study, a microbial consortium consisting of bacterial strains and fungal strains were originally obtained from endosulfan contaminated agricultural soils. identification of the bacterial isolates by 16s rrna sequences revealed the isolates to be halophilic bacterium jas4, klebsiella pneumoniae jas8, enterobacter asburiae jas5, and enterobacter cloacae jas7, whereas the fungal isolates were identified by 18s rrna sequences and the isolates were botryosphaeria laricina jas6, aspergillus tamarii jas9 and lasiodiplodia sp. jas12. the biodegradation of endosulfan was monitored by using hplc and ftir analysis. the bacterial and fungal consortium could degrade 1000 mg l(-1) of endosulfan efficiently in aqueous medium and in soil. the infrared spectrum of endosulfan degraded samples in the aqueous medium by bacterial and fungal consortium showed bands at 1400 and 950 cm(-1) which are the characteristics of cooh group and acid dimer band respectively. in the present investigation, low cost solid materials such as sawdust, soil, fly ash, molasses and nutrients were  used for the formulation of microbial consortium and to achieve greater multiplication and survival of the microbial strains.

TI  == expansion of esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (st15, st147, st336) and epidemic plasmids (incr, incfiik).
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates other than e. coli from portuguese hospitals. eighty-eight esbl-producing clinical isolates (69 klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter asburiae, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1 serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the north (a) or centre (b, c) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, esbl characterization, clonal (pfge, mlst) and plasmid (s1-pfge, i-ceui-pfge, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. isolates produced mostly ctx-m-15 (47%) or shv-12 (30%), and less frequently other shv- (15%; shv-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or  tem- (9%; tem-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. the increase of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv esbl-types observed in hospital a was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (mdr) k. pneumoniae epidemic clones (st15, st147, st336). shv-12 and tem-type esbls were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different enterobacteriaceae species in hospitals b and c in 2006-7. particular plasmid types were linked to blactx-m-15  (incr or non-typeable plasmids), blashv-12 (incr or inchi2), blashv-28/-55/-106 (incfiik1 or incfiik5), blatem-10 (incl/m) or blatem-24 (inca/c), mostly in epidemic clones. in our country, the amplification of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv-type esbl among non-e. coli enterobacteriaceae is linked to international mdr k. pneumoniae clones (st15, st147, st336) and plasmid types (incr, incfiik). furthermore, we highlight the potential of incfiik plasmids (here firstly associated with blashv-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in madrid, spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae st11 isolates.
AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == isolation, screening, characterization, and selection of superior rhizobacterial  strains as bioinoculants for seedling emergence and growth promotion of mandarin  orange (citrus reticulata blanco).
AB  == mandarin orange (mo) is an important fruit crop of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. a total of 217 morphologically distinct rhizobacteria from  mo orchards in 3 states of northeastern india were isolated and analyzed for 4 plant-growth-promoting (pgp) attributes: nitrogen fixation, production of indole  acetic acid like substances, solubilization of phosphate, and ability to antagonize pathogenic fungi. isolates were ranked based on in-vitro-assayed pgp attributes, and 10 superior isolates were selected to test their effect on seedling emergence and seedling growth in a completely randomized pot experiment. these 10 isolates increased seedling emergence over a noninoculated control within 45 days after sowing. five isolates, namely rce1, rce2, rce3, rce5, and rce7, significantly increased shoot length, shoot dry biomass, and root dry biomass of 120-day-old seedlings over the noninoculated control. the beneficial effects of 4 selected strains, namely enterobacter hormaechei rce-1, enterobacter asburiae rce-2, enterobacter ludwigii rce-5, and klebsiella pneumoniae rce-7, on  growth of the seedlings were visible up to 1 year after their transfer to 8 kg capacity pots. these strains were superior both in terms of in-vitro-assayed pgp  attributes and of their beneficial effect in low phosphorus soil and, thus, may be promising bioinoculants for promoting early emergence and growth of mo seedlings.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == a long-term low-frequency hospital outbreak of kpc-producing klebsiella pneumoniae involving intergenus plasmid diffusion and a persisting environmental  reservoir.
AB  == background: to study the molecular characteristics of a long-term, low frequency  outbreak of bla kpc-2 in a low prevalence setting involving the hospital environment. methodology/principal findings: kpc-producing bacteria were screened by selective chromogenic agar and real-time pcr. the presence of antibiotic resistance genes was ascribed by pcrs and subsequent sequencing, and the kpc-producing isolates were phylogenetically typed using pfge and multi-locus sequence typing. bla kpc-2-plasmids were identified and analysed by s1-nuclease-pfge hybridization and pcr based replicon typing. a approximately 97  kb incfii plasmid was seen to carry bla kpc-2 in all of the clinical isolates, in one of the isolates recovered from screened patients (1/136), and in the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter asburiae isolates recovered from the environment (sinks) in one intensive care unit. the k. pneumoniae strain st258 was identified in 6 out of 7 patients. an intergenus spread to e. asburiae and an interspecies spread to two different k. pneumoniae clones (st27 and st461) of the bla kpc-2 plasmid was discovered. k. pneumoniae st258 and genetically related e.  asburiae strains were found in isolates of both human and environmental origins.  conclusions/significance: we document a clonal transmission of the k. pneumoniae  st258 strain, and an intergenus plasmid diffusion of the incfii plasmid carrying  bla kpc-2 in this outbreak. a major reservoir in the patient population could not be unveiled. however, the identification of a persisting environmental reservoir  of strains with molecular determinants linked to human isolates, suggests a possible role of the environment in the maintenance of this long-term outbreak.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.

TI  == incidence of antibiotic-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter species  in freshwater wetlands.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to assess the incidence of enterobacteriaceae (potential human and animal pathogens) in wetlands. methods: enterobacteriaceae,  selected from the sediments and rhizosphere of wetland plant juncus effusus l., were analysed using classical microbiological methods, api20e, api20ne, fatty acid analyses, and 16s rrna sequencing. assessed virulence factors include antibiotic resistance, presence of plasmids and capsules. results: klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter asburiae, known human pathogens, were identified. k. pneumoniae 16s rrna gene sequence showed the significant hit (e < 0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from faeces of elderly individuals (accession number ab099804) when genbank database was used. ent. asburiae 16s rrna gene sequence showed the significant hit with (e < 0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from the pig gastrointestinal tract (accession number af371852). the rate of antibiotic resistance (<50 microg  ml(-1)) was high for ampicillin and cephalosporins for the most strains (75.7%) yet low (>10 to 20 microg ml(-1)) for kanamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol for all strains tested. capsules were detected in all investigated strains. pcr detected membrane protein but not chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase. significance and impact of the study: the antibiotic resistance of tested strains and presence of capsules (protect micro-organisms from phagocytosis) suggest that wetland sediments and rhizosphere present a potential reservoirs for enteric human and animal pathogens.

TI  == identification of enterobacter bacteria as saxitoxin producers in cattle's rumen  and surface water from venezuelan savannahs.
AB  == we have previously shown that a paralytic toxin able to block sodium channels in  nerve is associated with a cattle disease known as bovine paraplegic syndrome (bps) [toxicon. 31 (1993) 1581]. we have now identified this as saxitoxin (stx) using hplc by either the methods of [toxicon. 31 (1993) 1581], or [toxicon. 25 (1987) 1105]. in recent experiments we were able to collect and cultivate facultative anaerobic bacteria growing on rumen, grass and ponds of corrals with  high incidence of bps; the cultured bacteria produce compounds indistinguishable  from stx under both hplc procedures described above. two species of the enterobacter genus (e. asburiae and e. cloacae) and a strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, were identified using standard biochemical criteria as well as gas chromatography of bacterial lipids. all these bacteria produced stx in aerobic cultures.
