TI  == effects of baseplates of orthodontic appliances with in situ generated silver nanoparticles on cariogenic bacteria: a randomized, double-blind cross-over clinical trial.
AB  == aim: polymethyl-methacrylate (pmma) is commonly used primarily for baseplates of  orthodontic appliances (boa). the activities of cariogenic bacteria in bioflm on  these surfaces may contribute to dental caries, gingival infammation and periodontal disease. the pmma incorporated with nanoparti-cles of silver (nanoag-i-pmma) and nanoag in situ in pmma (nanoag-is-pmma) have been shown to control the growth of cariogenic bacteria, but clinical trial of anti-cariogenic  application of these novel materials in orthodontics has not been evaluated. the  main aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of using nanoag-is-pmma and nanoag-i-pmma for construction of new boa in inhibiting the planktonic growth and bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. materials and  methods: twenty four patients with a median age of 12.6 years (7-15) harboring streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as lactobacillus casei participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental boa, nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa, contained 0.5% w/w nanoag while the control boa was standard pmma. antibacterial effect of  nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa was assessed against test cariogenic bacteria by planktonic and bioflm bacterial cells growth inhibition. results: the average levels of test cariogenic bacteria in saliva decreased about 2 to 70 fold (30.9-98.4%) compared to baseline depending on the microorganism type and test boa. bioflm inhibition analysis demonstrated that nanoag-i-boa and nanoag-is-boa  inhibited the bioflm of all test bacteria by 20.1 to 79.9% compared to boa. nanoag-is-boa had a strong anti-bioflm effect against s. mutans, s. sobrinus and  l. casei. however, nanoag-i-boa showed only slight anti-bioflm effects on test bacteria. most notably, at all period of the clinical trial, nanoag-is-boa showed a higher antibacterial activity than nanoag-i-boa. conclusion: based on the novel data that presented here, the nanoag-is-boa had strong antimicrobial activity in  the planktonic phase and subsequent bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria.  clinical significance: wearing of nanoag-is-boa has the potential to minimize dental plaque formation and caries during orthodontic treatment.

TI  == a study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == objective: to explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella intermedia, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. methods: the bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (bhi) agar and bhi blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. results: the optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. there was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence  intensity and bacterial concentration. the mean optical density (mod) of s. mutans and l. acidophilus cultivated in bhi blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, p < 0.05). the mod of s. sanguis, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia cultivated in bhi blood agar was higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (37 +/-  12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, p > 0.05); the opposite was observed for c. albicans. conclusion: at 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic  bacteria. the fluorescence energy, q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus species on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary pathogen responsible for initiating dental caries and decay. the presence of sucrose, stimulates s. mutans to produce insoluble glucans to form oral biofilm also known as dental plaque to initiate caries lesion. the gtfb and luxs genes of s. mutans are responsible for formation and maturation of biofilm. lactobacillus species as probiotic can reduces the count of s. mutans. in this study effect of different lactobacillus species against the formation of s. mutans biofilm was observed. growing biofilm in the presence of sucrose was detected using 96 well microtiter plate crystal violet assay and biofilm formation by s. mutans in the presence of lactobacillus was detected. gene expression of biofilm forming genes (gtfb and luxs) was quantified through real-time pcr. all strains of lactobacillus potently reduced the formation of s. mutans biofilm whereas lactobacillus acidophilus reduced the genetic expression by 60-80%. therefore, probiotic lactobacillus species can be used as an alternative instead of antibiotics to decrease the chance of dental caries by reducing the count of s. mutans and their gene expression to maintain good oral health.

TI  == plasma deactivation of oral bacteria seeded on hydroxyapatite disks as tooth enamel analogue.
AB  == purpose: to study the plasma treatment effects on deactivation of oral bacteria seeded on a tooth enamel analogue. methods: a non-thermal atmospheric pressure argon plasma brush was used to treat two different gram-positive oral bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans). the bacteria were seeded on hydroxyapatite (ha) disks used as tooth enamel analogue with three initial bacterial seeding concentrations: a low inoculum concentration between 2.1 x 10(8) and 2.4 x 10(8) cfu/ml, a medium inoculum concentration between 9.8x10(8) and 2.4 x 10(9) cfu/ml, and a high inoculum concentration between 1.7 x 10(10) and 3.5 x 10(10) cfu/ml. the bacterial survivability upon plasma exposure was examined in terms of plasma exposure time and oxygen addition into the plasmas. sem was performed to examine  bacterial morphological changes after plasma exposure. results: the experimental  data indicated that a 13-second plasma exposure time completely killed all the bacteria when initial bacterial seeding density on ha surfaces was less than 6.9  x 10(6) cfu/cm2 for l. acidophilus and 1.7 x 10(7) cfu/cm2 for s. mutans, which resulted from low initial seeding inoculum concentration between 2.1 x 10(8) and  2.4 x 10(8) cfu/ml. plasma exposure of the bacteria at higher initial bacterial seeding density obtained with high initial seeding inoculum concentration, however, only resulted in approximately 1.5 to 2 log reduction and approximately  2 to 2.5 log reduction for l. acidophilus and s. mutans, respectively. it was also noted that oxygen addition into the argon plasma brush did not affect the plasma deactivation effectiveness. sem images showed that plasma deactivation mainly occurred with the top layer bacteria, while shadowing effects from the resulting bacterial debris reduced the plasma deactivation of the underlying bacteria.

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == an investigation of the effect of scaling-induced surface roughness on bacterial  adhesion in common fixed dental restorative materials.
AB  == statement of problem: bacterial plaque must be routinely removed from teeth, adjacent structures, and prostheses. however, the removal of this plaque can inadvertently increase the risk of future bacterial adhesion. purpose: the purpose of this investigation was to assess the change in the surface roughness of 3 different surfaces after dental prophylactic instrumentation and how this influenced bacterial adhesion. material and methods: forty specimens each of type iii gold alloy, lithium disilicate, and zirconia were fabricated in the same dimensions. the specimens were divided into 4 groups: ultrasonic scaler, stainless steel curette, prophylaxis cup, and control. pretreatment surface roughness measurements were made with a profilometer. surface treatments in each  group were performed with a custom mechanical scaler. posttreatment surface roughness values were measured. in turn, the specimens were inoculated with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus. bacterial adhesion was assessed by rinsing the specimens with sterile saline to remove unattached cells. the specimens were then placed in sterile tubes with 1 ml of sterile saline. the solution was plated and quantified. scanning electron microscopy was performed. the statistical analysis of surface roughness was completed by using repeated-measures single-factor anova with a bonferroni correction. results: the surface roughness values for gold alloy specimens increased as a result of prophylaxis cup treatment (0.221 to 0.346 ra) (p<.01) and stainless steel curette treatment (0.264 to 1.835 ra) (p<.01). the results for bacterial adhesion to gold alloy proved inconclusive. a quantitative comparison indicated no statistically significant differences in pretreatment and posttreatment surface roughness values for lithium disilicate and zirconia specimens. in spite of these similarities, the overall bacterial adherence values for lithium disilicate were significantly greater than those recorded for gold alloy or zirconia (p<.05). instrumentation of the lithium disilicate and zirconia with the stainless steel curette significantly increased bacterial adhesion compared with the control (p<.05). conclusions: the results of this investigation indicate that type iii gold alloy exhibited increased surface roughness values after stainless steel curette and prophylaxis cup treatments. zirconia was less susceptible to bacterial adhesion than lithium disilicate, and greater bacterial  adhesion was found for the stainless steel curette than the other instrumentation methods.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of a fermented papaya preparation on growth, hydrophobicity, and acid production of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus acidophilus: its implications in oral health improvement of diabetics.
AB  == fermented papaya preparation (fpp) is a "natural health product." the high incidence of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. the potential role of fpp against common oral microbiota (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral  cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. fpp showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: -6.9%; s. mitis: -4.47%, p < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/ml: s. mutans: +6.38%; l. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/ml: s. mutans: 1.01%, p < 0.01; s. mitis: 7.66%, p < 0.05) of tested microbiota. the results of this study suggest that low doses of fpp may be a suitable complement  to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and gingivitis. the functional application of fpp as a constituent of a balanced diet and active lifestyle can make a positive contribution to the oral health status and well-being of patients with diabetes.

TI  == intensity and duration of in-vitro antibacterial activity of different adhesives  used in orthodontics.
AB  == this work investigated the antibacterial activity of 14 bonding agents to predict their ability to inhibit white-spot development during orthodontic treatment. standardized, sterilized disks of each material were continuously rinsed (for up  to 180 d) in a flow of sterile saline. at predetermined time points, the residual ability of each material to inhibit bacterial growth (determined by measuring the size of inhibition halos around disks placed onto appropriate culture media seeded with streptococcus gordonii dsm6777, streptococcus sanguinis dsm20567, streptococcus mutans dsm20523, or lactobacillus acidophilus dsm20079) and biofilm formation (determined by measuring the numbers of bacteria adherent to disks following incubation in appropriate broths) was tested in triplicate and compared with the baseline activities of freshly prepared materials. overall antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities, adjusted for exposure time and strain of bacteria, were assessed. the decrease of antibacterial activity was faster (30-60 d) and complete for fluoride-enriched materials, but slower (90 d) and partial for antimicrobial-containing materials (benzalkonium chloride, zinc oxide, chlorexidine, or mdpb). materials enriched with benzalkonium chloride, chlorexidine, or mdpb showed the highest antibacterial activities. anti-biofilm assays yielded similar results. these data could be helpful for clinicians in the choice of the best performing bonding agent also in light of duration of the clinical application.

TI  == dental caries and vaccination strategy against the major cariogenic pathogen, streptococcus mutans.
AB  == although dental caries is a global problem in modern times, no vaccines are available for preventing these diseases. among the bacterial pathogens that cause dental caries, including streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, s. mutans is the most prominent and prevalent species. during the past, much effort has been focused on developing vaccines against s. mutans. early attempts used fixed whole cells of s. mutans, but later it was found that serological cross-reactivity between heart tissue antigens and streptococcus antigens occurs in patients resulting in rheumatic fever. recently, with the aid of molecular biology, the genome sequences of s. mutans strains are available, which can greatly accelerate the development of subunit vaccines. many desirable candidate subunit vaccines have been or are going to be evaluated in either experimental animal models or in human clinical trials. in this review article, we summarized the updated progress made in deciphering the mechanisms of disease development and the achievements of vaccine research against s. mutans.

TI  == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel,  providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

TI  == simultaneous improvement of specificity and affinity of aptamers against streptococcus mutans by in silico maturation for biosensor development.
AB  == in silico evolution with an in vitro system can facilitate the development of functional aptamers with high specificity and affinity. although a general technique known as systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (selex) is an efficient method for aptamer selection, it sometimes fails to identify aptamers with sufficient binding properties. we have previously developed in silico maturation (ism) to improve functions of aptamers based on genetic algorithms. ism represents an intelligent exploitation of a random search within a defined sequence space to optimize aptamer sequences and improve their function of interest. here we demonstrated a successful application of ism of aptamers to simultaneously improve specificity and affinity for streptococcus mutans with discovery of a core sequence, which was required to form a polymerized guanine quadruplex structure for target binding. we applied ism to aptamers selected by whole-cell selex and identified an aptamer with up to 16-fold improvement in affinity compared to its parent aptamers, and specificity  was increased to show 12-fold more binding to s. mutans than to lactobacillus acidophilus. furthermore, we demonstrated a specific flow-through detection of s. mutans at a concentration range of 1 x 10(5) -10(8) cfu/ml using the evolved aptamer immobilized on gold colloids.

TI  == lab-test((r)) 4: dental caries and bacteriological analysis.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common infectious ultifactorial diseases worldwide, characterized by the progressive demineralization of the tooth, following the action of bacterial acid metabolism. the main factors predisposing  the onset of the carious process are: 1) the presence of bacterial species able to lower the ph until critical values of 5.5, 2) the absence of adequate oral hygiene, 3) an inefficient immune response anti-caries, 4) the type of alimentary diet and 5) the structure of the teeth. among the 200 bacterial species isolated  from dental plaque the most pathogenic for dental caries are: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomices viscusus and bifidobacterium dentium. our laboratory (lab((r)) s.r.l., codigoro, ferrara,  italy) has developed a test for absolute and relative quantification of the most  common oral cariogenic bacteria. the test uses specific primers and probes for the amplification of bacteria genome sequences in polymerase chain reaction real  time. the results provide a profile of patient infection, helpful for improving the diagnosis and planning of preventive treatment to reduce the bacterial load.

AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a technique that involves the activation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the production  of reactive radicals that are capable of inducing cell death. the present study evaluated the susceptibility of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus to pdt grown as multi-species in the biofilm phase versus in dentine  carious lesions. a brain-heart infusion culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 2% sucrose, and 1% young primary culture of l. acidophilus 10(8) cfu/ml  and s. mutans 10(8) cfu/ml was used to develop multi-species biofilms and to induce caries on human dentine slabs. five different concentrations of curcumin (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 g/l) were used associated with 5.7 j/cm(2) light emission diode. four different groups were analyzed l-d- (control group), l-d+ (drug group), l+d- (light group), and l+d+ (pdt group). anova/tukey's tests were  conducted to compare groups. a significant reduction (p <0.05) in cell viability  was observed in the biofilm phase following photosensitization with all curcumin  concentrations tested. to achieve significant bacterial reduction (p <0.05) in carious dentine, it was necessary to utilize 5.0 g/l of curcumin in association with blue light. no significant reduction was found for l-d+, supporting the absence of the drug's dark toxicity. s. mutans and l. acidophilus were susceptible to curcumin in the presence of blue light. however, due to light penetration and drug diffusion difficulties, these microorganisms within dentine  carious lesions were less affected than they were in the biofilm phase.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == photodynamic effects of curcumin against cariogenic pathogens.
AB  == background data: the presence of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus in dental structure is an indicator of a cariogenic biofilm. photodynamic therapy is a technique that involves the activation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the production  of reactive radicals capable of inducing cell death. reduction of bacteria levels can provide additional means of preventing dental caries. objective: the present  study evaluated the susceptibility of planktonic cultures of s. mutans (atcc 25175) and l. acidophilus (atcc-ial-523) from the adolfo lutz institute (ial) to  photodynamic therapy after sensitization with curcumin and exposure to blue light at 450 nm. methods: bacterial suspensions of s. mutans and l. acidophilus isolated (as single species) and combined (multspecies) were prepared and then evaluated. four different groups were analyzed: l-d- (control group), l-d+ (drug  group), l+d- (light group), and l+d+ (photodynamic therapy group). two different  concentrations of curcumin were tested (0.75 and 1.5 g/l) associated with a 5.7 j/cm(2) light emission diode. results: significant decreases (p<0.05) in the viability of s. mutans were only observed when the bacterial suspensions were exposed to both curcumin and light. then, reductions in viability of up to 99.99% were observed when using 1.5 g/l of the photosensitizer. the susceptibility of l. acidophilus was considerably lower (21% and 37.6%) for both curcumin concentrations. conclusions: photodynamic therapy was found to be effective in reducing s. mutans and l. acidophilus on planktonic cultures. no significant reduction was found for l-d+, proving the absence of dark toxicity of the drug.

TI  == enzymology and structure of the gh13_31 glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase that confers isomaltooligosaccharide utilization in the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm.
AB  == isomaltooligosaccharides (imo) have been suggested as promising prebiotics that stimulate the growth of probiotic bacteria. genomes of probiotic lactobacilli from the acidophilus group, as represented by lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, encode alpha-1,6 glucosidases of the family gh13_31 (glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 31) that confer degradation of imo. these genes reside frequently within maltooligosaccharide utilization operons, which include an atp-binding cassette transporter and alpha-glucan active enzymes, e.g., maltogenic amylases and maltose phosphorylases, and they also occur separated from any carbohydrate transport or catabolism genes on the genomes of some acidophilus complex members, as in l. acidophilus ncfm. besides the isolated locus encoding a gh13_31 enzyme,  the abc transporter and another gh13 in the maltooligosaccharide operon were induced in response to imo or maltotetraose, as determined by reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) transcriptional analysis, suggesting coregulation of alpha-1,6- and alpha-1,4-glucooligosaccharide utilization loci in l. acidophilus  ncfm. the l. acidophilus ncfm gh13_31 (lagh13_31) was produced recombinantly and  shown to be a glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase active on imo and dextran and product-inhibited by glucose. the catalytic efficiency of lagh13_31 on dextran and the dextran/panose (trisaccharide) efficiency ratio were the highest reported for this class of enzymes, suggesting higher affinity at distal substrate binding sites. the crystal structure of lagh13_31 was determined to a resolution of 2.05  a and revealed additional substrate contacts at the +2 subsite in lagh13_31 compared to the gh13_31 from streptococcus mutans (smgh13_31), providing a possible structural rationale to the relatively high affinity for dextran. a comprehensive phylogenetic and activity motif analysis mapped imo utilization enzymes from gut microbiota to rationalize preferential utilization of imo by gut residents.

TI  == the effect of a probiotic strain (lactobacillus acidophilus) on the plaque formation of oral streptococci.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of biofilm formation among mutans and non mutans oral streptococci and to determine the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 20079 as a probiotic strain on the adhesion of selected streptococcal strains on the surfaces. the sample comprised 40 isolates  of oral streptococci from dental plaque and caries of volunteer persons. streptococcus mutans atcc35668 (no24) was as an standard strain. the probiotic strain was lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 20079. the ability of biofilm formation  was investigated with colorimetric method and the strongest isolates were selected. then the effect of probiotic strain on the adhesion of streptococci isolates was determined in polystyrene microtiter plate simultaneously and 30 minutes before streptococci entrance to the system. the results showed that 42% of mutans streptococci were strongly adherent (sa) and in non mutans streptococci, only 23.5% of isolates were found strongly adherent. the strong biofilm forming bacterium isolated was streptococcus mutans strain22. in the next step, in the presence of probiotic strain the streptococcal adhesion were reduced, and this reduction was non significantly stronger if the probiotic strain was inoculated to the system before the oral bacteria. the lactobacillus acidophilus had more effect on adherence of mutans streptococci than non mutans streptococci with significant difference (p < 0.05). adhesion reduction is likely due to bacterial interactions and colonization of adhesion sites with probiotic strain before the presence of streptococci. adhesion reduction can be an effective way on decreasing cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == selected aspects of the oral environment in cleft palate patients--a problem evidently beyond dentists' scope.
AB  == introduction: the oral cavity is a specialized ecosystem composed of dentition and mucosa exposed to the effects of saliva and gingival liquid. its structure provides advantageous conditions for various microorganisms, both aerobic streptococci and anaerobic bacilli. the dynamic balance of the oral cavity ecosystem can be threatened by various factors. lip and palatal clefts are the most frequent disorders in embryonic facial development. the aim of the study was to evaluate whether streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus and oral cavity hygiene in patients with cleft palate treated orthodontically are significantly different compared with patients without these congenital malformations. material/methods: the study group consisted of 200 patients aged 6-21 who were divided into two groups depending on the presence of cleft palate and treatment method. group c (control) consisted of 50 orthodontically untreated patients with occlusal dental defects. the performed studies consisted of 2 parts: the clinical-laboratory part and statistical analysis. clinical-laboratory part results: high bacteria levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus in saliva of patients were comparably frequent between groups, but there were statistically significant differences in inter-group comparisons. conclusions: as the orthodontic treatment changes the oral environment, control of proper hygienic behavior is an essential element of health education. introduction of preventive programs is also very important.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus-derived biosurfactant effect on gtfb and gtfc expression level in streptococcus mutans biofilm cells.
AB  == streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), harboring biofilm formation, considered as a main aetiological factor of dental caries. gtf genes play an important role in s. mutans biofilm formation. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus-derived biosurfactant on s. mutans biofilm formation and gtfb/c expression level (s. mutans standard strain atcc35668 and isolated s.  mutans strain (22) from dental plaque). the lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) dsm 20079 was selected as a probiotic strain to produce biosurfactant. the ftir analysis of its biosurfactant showed that it appears to have a protein-like component. due to the release of such biosurfactants, l. acidophilus was able to interfere in the adhesion and biofilm formation of the s. mutans to glass slide. it also could make streptococcal chains shorter. using realtime rt-pcr quantitation method made it clear that gtfb and gtfc gene expression were decreased in the presence of l. acidophilus-derived biosurfactant fraction. several properties of s. mutans cells (the surface properties, biofilm  formation, adhesion ability and gene expression) were changed after l. acidophilus- derived biosurfactant treatment. it is also concluded that biosurfacant treatment can provide an optional way to control biofilm development. on the basis of our findings, we can suggest that the prepared biosurfactant may interfere with adhesion processes of s. mutans to teeth surfaces, provided additional evaluation produce satisfactory results.

TI  == effect of the antimicrobial decapeptide ksl on the growth of oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == dental caries and periodontitis are common oral bacterial infectious diseases. their prevention and treatment requires control of the causative pathogens, such  as streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, that exist within dental plaque. as one of the attractive future substitutes for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (amps), both natural and synthetic, have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of ksl (kkvvfkvkfk-nh(2)), a novel amp, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as candida albicans in vitro. streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, was chosen for in-depth testing. bacterial susceptibility and time-kill assays were performed to investigate the sensitivity of s. mutans to ksl. the effect of ksl on biofilm formation and on pre-formed biofilm was also examined. for biofilm studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) was used to observe and analyse bacterial biofilm. the results showed that ksl had antimicrobial activity against a variety of oral bacteria and fungi. streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus were the most susceptible strains to ksl peptide [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.0625 mg/ml] compared with other species tested (mics of 0.125-1mg/ml). ksl also inhibited s.  mutans biofilm formation, with a minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 0.0625-0.125 mg/ml, and reduced 1-day-old developed s. mutans biofilm, with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. clsm images showed that ksl significantly reduced the viability of biofilm cells. this study suggests that ksl may have a potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == oral bacterial deactivation using a low-temperature atmospheric argon plasma brush.
AB  == objective: to study the plasma treatment effects on deactivation effectiveness of oral bacteria. methods: a low temperature atmospheric argon plasma brush were used to study the oral bacterial deactivation effects in terms of plasma conditions, plasma exposure time, and bacterial supporting media. oral bacteria of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus with an initial bacterial population density between 1.0x10(8) and 5.0x10(8)cfu/ml were seeded on various media and their survivability with plasma exposure was examined. scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological changes of the plasma treated bacteria. optical absorption was used to determine the leakage of intracellular proteins and dnas of the plasma treated bacteria. results: the experimental data indicated that the argon atmospheric plasma brush was very effective in deactivating oral bacteria. the plasma exposure time for a 99.9999%  cell reduction was less than 15s for s. mutans and within 5 min for l. acidophilus. it was found that the plasma deactivation efficiency was also dependent on the bacterial supporting media. with plasma exposure, significant damages to bacterial cell structures were observed with both bacterium species. leakage of intracellular proteins and dnas after plasma exposure was observed through monitoring the absorbance peaks at wavelengths of 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively. conclusion: the experimental results from this study indicated that low temperature atmospheric plasma treatment was very effective in deactivation of oral bacteria and could be a promising technique in various dental clinical applications such as bacterial disinfection and caries early prevention.

TI  == nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  == nisin, produced by lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. in the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericide concentration (mbc) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different mic, mbc and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. there was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in pbs and saliva (p>0.05). furthermore, morphology and membranes of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus fermenti and lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem). our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

TI  == dental caries vaccine.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common diseases in humans. in modern times, it has reached epidemic proportions. dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease of the teeth that results in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissue. dental caries is a mulitifactorial disease, which is caused by  host, agent, and environmental factors. the time factor is important for the development and progression of dental caries. a wide group of microorganisms are  identified from carious lesions of which s. mutans , lactobacillus acidophilus ,  and actinomyces viscosus are the main pathogenic species involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. in india, surveys done on school children showed caries prevalence of approximately 58%. surveys among the u.s. population showed an incidence of 45.3% in children and 93.8% in adults with either past or present coronal caries. huge amounts of money and time are spent in treating dental caries. hence, the prevention and control of dental caries is  the main aim of public health, eventually the ultimate objective of public health is the elimination of the disease itself. recently, dental caries vaccines have been developed for the prevention of dental caries. these dental caries vaccines  are still in the early stages.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial activity of different self-etching primers and adhesives.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of different one-step and two-step self-etching primer/adhesives on streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), lactobacillus casei (l. casei), and lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus). methods and materials: the antibacterial effects of clearfil protect bond primer and bonding agent; adhese primer and bonding agent; adper prompt l-pop; futurabond nr; clearfil tri s bond; and cervitec (positive control, 1% chlorhexidine varnish) were tested against standard strains of s. mutans, l. casei, and l. acidophilus using the disk diffusion method. standard filter paper  disks (n=5) impregnated with 20 microl of each material were prepared. after incubation at 37 masculinec for 48 hours in a 5-10% co2 atmosphere, the diameter  of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (anova) and multivariate analysis of variance (manova).  duncan's multiple range test was used for pairwise comparison. results: the size  of inhibition zones produced by primer/adhesives varied among the brands. adhese  primer: s. mutans (20.6+/-1.51); l. casei (14.8+/-1.78); l. acidophilus (11.4+/-0.54). adper prompt l-pop: s. mutans (19.6+/-1.51); l. casei (13.8+/-1.64); l. acidophilus (13.8+/-1.09). cervitec: s. mutans (23+/-0.00); l.  casei (27+/-0.70); l. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). clearfil protect bond primer: s. mutans (17+/-0.00); l. casei (17.6+/-0.54); l. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). futurabond nr was found effective only against s. mutans (14.6+/-1.67). of all the materials tested, adhese bonding agent, clearfil protect bond bonding agent,  and clearfil tri s bond exhibited no inhibition zone (-) for all bacteria tested. conclusion: among the adhesives tested clearafil protect bond primer based upon monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridiniium bromide (mdpb) was found to be the most potent material against l. acidophilus and l. casei. adhese primer and adper prompt l-pop are highly effective against s. mutans. clinical significance: compared with other adhesive systems, clearfil protect bond primer (containing mdpb) showed a high antibacterial effect against all microorganizms tested. two-step, self-etching primer/adhesive system clearfil protect bond might be a suitable choice under minimally invasive restorations. the recently developed one-step, self-etching system clearfil tri s bond showed no antibacterial effect  against microorgazims tested.

TI  == acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  == some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. however, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. the ph fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. all strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in ph with sorbitol and two with xylitol. none of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. as all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for  oral health purposes can be made.

TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == antimicrobial photodynamic action on dentin using a light-emitting diode light source.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was the evaluation of two different photosensitizers activated by red light emitted by light-emitting diodes (leds) in the decontamination of carious bovine dentin. materials and methods: fifteen bovine incisors were used to obtain dentin samples which were immersed in brain-heart infusion culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 2% sucrose, and 1% young primary culture of lactobacillus acidophilus 10(8) cfu/ml and streptococcus mutans 10(8) cfu/ml for caries induction. three different concentrations of the photogem solution, a hematoporphyrin derivative (1, 2, and  3 mg/ml) and two different concentrations of toluidine blue o (tbo), a basic dye  (0.025 and 0.1 mg/ml) were used. to activate the photosensitizers two different light exposure times were used: 60 sec and 120 sec, corresponding respectively to the doses of 24 j/cm(2) and 48 j/cm(2). results: after counting the numbers of cfu per milligram of carious dentin, we observed that the use of led energy in association with photogem or tbo was effective for bacterial reduction in carious dentin, and that the greatest effect on s. mutans and l. acidophilus was obtained with tbo at 0.1 mg/ml and a dose of 48 j/cm(2). it was also observed that the overall toxicity of tbo was higher than that of photogem, and that the phototoxicity of tbo was higher than that of photogem. conclusion: based on our data we propose a mathematical model for the photodynamic effect when different photosensitizer concentrations and light doses are used.

TI  == can different chlorhexidine agents be used as cavity disinfectants?
AB  == this study used the agar well method to compare the antimicrobial effect of cavity disinfectants containing chlorhexidine with other chlorhexidine agents (such as mouthrinses and antiseptics) and to determine whether there was a difference in composite bond strength when these chlorhexidine agents were applied to the dentin surface. all tested solutions showed antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans (p  < 0.05). however, savlex was found to be the most effective antibacterial agent against all microorganisms (p < 0.05). there were no significant differences between the bond strengths obtained from the cavity disinfectants and those of the control group (p > 0.05). however, the mouthrinse and the antiseptic decreased the shear bond strength compared with the control group (p < 0.05).

TI  == effect of resin adhesive systems on root caries formation in vitro.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the capability of different adhesive systems to inhibit in vitro caries formation. method and materials: four materials were tested: gluma comfort bond (gl; heraeus kulzer), gluma comfort bond + desensitizer (gl+; heraeus kulzer), ibond (ib; heraeus kulzer), and one-up bond f (oub; tokuyama). bovine roots were ground to obtain flat mesial and distal dentin surfaces. nail varnish was applied to the entire root surface except for two 10 mm x 2 mm windows on the flattened surfaces. the adhesives were applied to the exposed areas according to the manufacturers' instructions. the roots were incubated at 37 degrees c for 1 week in a suspension of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus. control groups either received no root surface treatment or were etched with 37% phosphoric acid (without immersion in the bacterial suspension).  specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of the roots, stained for 24 hours with rhodamine b, and analyzed with confocal laser microscopy. the data  were analyzed by 1-way anova and fisher's plsd test at 95% confidence level. results: lesions in the oub, ib, and gl+ groups were significantly shallower than those in the no-treatment group. acid etching did not produce any measurable lesions. mean lesion depth in the gl group was similar to that in the no-treatment group. there was no significant difference between mean lesion depths in the gl+, gl, and ib groups. conclusion: fluoride- and glutaraldehyde-containing adhesive systems might be an aid in root caries prevention.

TI  == effects of natural cross-linkers on the stability of dentin collagen and the inhibition of root caries in vitro.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the effects of dentin collagen modifications induced by various cross-linkers on the stability of collagen matrix and the inhibition of root caries. materials and methods: the following cross-linkers were tested: 5% glutaraldehyde (ga), 0.5% proanthocyanidin (pa), 0.625% genipin (ge). in the first experiment, cross-linker-treated demineralized human root dentin was digested with bacterial collagenase, centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to amino acid analysis to determine collagen content. the residues were analyzed by sds-page and hydroxyproline analysis. in the second experiment, bovine root surfaces were conditioned with phosphoric acid, treated with the cross-linkers, incubated with streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus  for 1 week and the root caries inhibition was evaluated with confocal microscopy. lastly, the ability of the bacteria to colonize the root surface was evaluated. in this experiment slabs of bovine root were treated with the cross-linkers and incubated in a suspension of s. mutans and l. acidophilus. the slabs were washed, resuspended in water, glucose was added, and the ph measured. results: while all  collagen was digested with collagenase in the control groups, only a small proportion was solubilized in the ga-, pa-, and ge-treated groups. the root caries was significantly inhibited by treatment with pa or ga. drops in ph in the cross-linker-treated groups were essentially the same as in the untreated group.  conclusion: naturally occurring cross-linkers, especially pa, could be used to modify root dentin collagen to efficiently stabilize collagen and to increase its resistance against caries.

TI  == influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of self-etching adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the incorporation of antibacterial agents into adhesive systems has been proposed to eliminate residual bacteria from dentine. this study used the agar diffusion method to evaluate the antibacterial activity of clearfil protect  bond (cpb), clearfil se bond (cseb), clearfil tri-s bond (c3sb) and xeno-iii (xiii) self-etching adhesive systems, with or without light-activation, against cariogenic bacteria, and to assess the influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of these materials. methods: an aliquot of 10 microl per material (and individual components) were pipetted onto paper and dentine discs distributed in petri dishes containing bacterial culture in bhi agar. positive control was 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx). results: after incubation, the  adhesive components of cpb and cseb, liquid a of xiii and c3sb did not present antibacterial activity when applied to paper discs. the non-light-activated cpb primer+adhesive promoted the greatest inhibition of streptococcus mutans (p<0.05), whereas with light-activation, there was no significant difference between primer+adhesive and primer alone. for lactobacillus acidophilus, cpb primer presented the greatest antibacterial activity in both light-activation conditions (p<0.05). regarding the dentine discs, only chx promoted an inhibitory effect, though less intense than on paper discs (p<0.05). chx presented greater antibacterial activity against s. mutans than against l. acidophilus (p<0.05). conclusions: light-activation significantly reduced the antibacterial activity of the self-etching adhesive systems; mdpb incorporation contributed to the effect of adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria; the components eluted from the adhesive systems were not capable to diffuse through 400 microm-thick dentine disc to exert their antibacterial activity against cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == long-term antibacterial effects and physical properties of a chlorhexidine-containing glass ionomer cement.
AB  == statement of the problem: many regions in the world do not have electricity, water, or access to dental facilities that allows the treatment of caries with dental handpieces and rotary burs. for restorative techniques used in these regions, an antibacterial self-adherent glass ionomer material would contribute considerably. purpose: this study aimed to test if chlorhexidine diacetate (fluka biochemika, buchs, switzerland)- or chlorhexidine digluconate (sigma-aldrich, steinheim, germany)-added chemfil superior glass ionomer cement (dentsply detrey, konstanz, germany) had any long-term antibacterial effect against certain oral bacteria and to test the new formulation's physical properties. materials and methods: chemfil superior was used as a control. chlorhexidine diacetate (powder) was added to the powder and chlorhexidine digluconate (liquid) was mixed with the powder in order to obtain 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5% concentrations of the respective groups. setting time, compressive strength, and acid erosion were tested according to iso 9917-1. working time, hardness, diametral tensile strength, and  biaxial flexural strength were also determined. long-term antimicrobial activity  against s. mutans, l. acidophilus, and c. albicans were tested with the agar diffusion method. analysis of variance (anova) was used for comparison (p < 0.05). results: regarding the immediate antibacterial effect for s. mutans, all the tested groups showed inhibitions of the strain compared with the control group (p < 0.05), with larger zones for the higher concentration groups and all the diacetates. for l. acidophilus, all the groups were effective compared with the control, but the greatest antibacterial effect was observed with the 2.5% diacetate group. the 2.5% group of chlorhexidine diacetate showed antibacterial activity up to 90 days against s. mutans and up to 60 days against l. acidophilus. the working and setting time, acid erosion test, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength of the tested groups were not different from the control chemfil group. however, the 1.25 and 2.5% groups of chlorhexidine diacetate had significantly lower compressive strengths than the control group. lower hardness values were obtained with the 0.5 and 2.5% chlorhexidine digluconate groups in comparison with the control group. clinical significance: the results of this in vitro investigation demonstrated that chlorhexidine diacetate or digluconate added to the chemfil superior glass ionomer material can exhibit long-term antibacterial effects against s. mutans and l. acidophilus without compromising the physical properties of the material.

TI  == comparison of antibacterial properties of two fluoride-releasing and a nonfluoride-releasing pit and fissure sealants.
AB  == occlusal pits and fissures are the most susceptible sites for the development of  dental caries and prevention is difficult in the areas of occurrence. although only 12.5% of all the tooth surfaces are occlusal, these surfaces develop more than two-thirds of total caries experienced by children. the fate of the bacteria is of significance when they are inadvertently sealed by a dental sealant. this study aimed in examining the antibacterial properties of three commercially available sealants, viz., teethmate-f, helioseal-f and helioseal. antibacterial testing was done by disc diffusion method. selective agars were used to grow streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of dental caries. statistical analysis was carried out using student's t test. the study proved that helioseal-f and helioseal did not possess antibacterial properties and teethmate-f was the only sealant that showed antibacterial properties.

TI  == targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == an in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. in this study, a quantitative taqman pcr assay (qpcr) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species  in the formation of the oral biofilm. in addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. with this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16s rdna sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (isr) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. among the target organisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, micromonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, tannerella forsythensis, and veillonella parvula. primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. the relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in  saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. this new broad spectrum qpcr assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.

TI  == micronucleus rate of buccal mucosal epithelial cells in relation to oral hygiene  and dental factors.
AB  == carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas in the upper aero-digestive tract (uadt) is a multi-stage process. since 1937, micronuclei (mn) have been considered a marker for genome damage in the initiation stage. by help of the micronucleus test, carcinogenic exposure can be proven in the mucosa area of the  uadt. the hypothesis to be tested was that individual oral hygiene and the dental status, respectively - just like alcohol and tobacco abuse - are associated with  the micronucleus rate in cytological preparations of the buccal mucosa. in a prospective clinical observation study, we determined in 100 probands the micronucleus frequency per 1000 mucosa epithelial cells. study participants with  a high number of missing teeth (m/t index, p=0.037), a below-average papillary bleeding index (pbi, p=0.032) and periodontal status, respectively (psi, p=0.042) possessed a higher micronucleus number in comparison with restored dental conditions. probands with composite restorations displayed a higher mn rate (p=0.006) compared to those with amalgam. however, we could not detect any significant relation with the prosthetic status (p> or =0.075). an adjustment was made according to alcohol and tobacco. we therefore conclude that subgingival plaque and synthetic dental materials in addition to chronic alcohol and tobacco  consumption might have genotoxic relevance in the oral cavity.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

AB  == objectives: there is increasing prevalence of root caries. we hypothesized different biofilms will cause varying demineralization in cementum. this study investigated the extent of demineralization of cementum by oral biofilm formed from three major cariogenic microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces israelii. sound cementum tooth blocks were incubated with mono-, bi-, and tri-species combinations of the bacteria under investigation. materials and methods: the matrix (amide i) and phosphate content  of the lesions was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), and calcium and phosphorus levels were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (sem-edx). results: the log[amide i:hpo(4)(2-) absorbance] values showed that a. israelii mono-culture caused significantly more demineralization than the other bacterial cultures. log[ca:p] showed that all carious lesions were confined to the cementum. conclusions: oral biofilm arising  from bacterial species a. israelii alone was the most cariogenic of those tested  and produced the most demineralization in incipient carious lesions in cementum.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == the effectiveness of alumina powder on carious dentin removal.
AB  == this study determined the size of aluminum oxide particles used in an air abrasion system that is able to remove carious dentin tissue with maximum preservation of sound structure. thirty extracted and carious-free third molars were used in this study. the dentin sample was obtained by sectioning the middle  of the crown longitudinal to the long axis of the tooth in a mesio-distal direction. one half of the crown corresponded to the sound dentin group (sd), while the other half was used to develop artificial caries, constituting the carious dentin group (cd). the specimens were air abraded for 15 seconds. the sd  and cd groups were each randomly divided into three subgroups (n=10) according to the particle diameter employed (27, 50 and 125 microm). the prepared cavity was perpendicularly cut in half, and the profiles of all hemi-fragments were observed using sem microscopy. the cavity measurements were made using a modified cephalometric analysis. the 27, 50 and 125 microm aluminum oxide particles did not present selectivity in the removal of carious dentin. however, when using the air abrasive technique for carious dentin treatment, the use of 27 and 50 microm  aluminum oxide particles is recommended, due to their capacity to remove less sound tissue than the 125 microm particles.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by sonicare advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. methods: a wild strain of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius and veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. for each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. biofilms were divided into four groups and  were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. the distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. a colorimetric technique (mtt assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the  adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. results: anova results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of s. mutans  and s. salivarius adherent to the disks, while l. acidophilus and v. alcalescens  seemed to remain basically unaffected. in the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while s. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, s. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to sonicare.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and tightness of a dcpd-cao-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB  == calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. however,  it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. in consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. by mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (cahpo4 . 2h2o, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dcpd) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a cpc with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. the setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (ha) or a mixture of ha and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of dcpd and cao in the cement  powder. the presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and  a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. the cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (ca/p) of 1.67  to 2.75. a pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with ca/p > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. with ca/p = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. dcpd-cao-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.

TI  == salivary actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  == background: gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. methods: to test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also  associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. the study population consisted of 297 predominantly african- american women who were pregnant for the first time. the salivary bacterial levels evaluated were streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. results: for 1 unit increase in log(10) a. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; se = 29.1; p = 0.04), and a 0.17  week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; se = 0.09; p = 0.05). in contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) l. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; se = 19.3; p = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; se = 0.06; p = 0.04). conclusions: we conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. these organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.

TI  == study of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB  == calcium phosphate-based cements (cpcs) have attracted much interest because of their good osteoconductivity for bone reconstruction. we obtained cpcs by mixing  calcium bis-dihydrogenophosphate monohydrate (mcpm) and calcium oxide with water  or sodium phosphate buffers (nap) as liquid phase. cement samples with different  calcium-to-phosphate ratios (ca/p), liquid-to-powder ratios (l/p) and liquid phases were analyzed by x-rays diffraction (xrd), ph-metry, extensometry and calorimetry. antibacterial activity on two bacterial strains (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus) and a polycontaminated bacterial inoculum was  also studied using the agar diffusion method. the best mechanical properties (approximately 25 mpa) corresponded to ca/p ratios between 1.67 and 2.5, a 1 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 7, as liquid phase and a l/p ratio of 0.6ml g(-1). the final setting time increased with the ca/p ratio. the setting expansion, around 1-2%, depended on the ca/p and l/p ratios. the inner temperature of the cements rose to 45 degrees during setting then decreased rapidly. the injectability was 100% up to 3.5 min and then decreased. it increased with increasing the l/p ratio but to the detriment of the compressive strength and setting time. xrd analysis indicated that the setting reaction led to a mixture of calcium hydroxide and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite even for a ca/p ratio of 1.67. consequently, the ph of the surrounding fluids rose to 11.5-12 during their dissolution. bacterial  growth inhibition was only clearly observed for ca/p>or=2. this bioactive calcium phosphate cement can potentially be employed for pulp capping and cavity lining as classical calcium hydroxide-based cements, but it is not usable, in the present formulation, for root canal filling because of its short setting time.

TI  == salivary iga to cariogenic bacteria in hiv-positive children and its correlation  with caries prevalence and levels of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the interrelationship of hiv infection, dental caries and mucosal immune responses remains controversial. in our study population of 40 hiv-infected and 40 healthy control children (ages 2-5 years) there was a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries in hiv-infected children (p<0.05). the extent of caries correlated with the severity of hiv disease. to determine whether the immunosuppression that ensues after hiv infection could contribute to the increased caries prevalence, the concentrations of total iga and iga specific to  cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus acidophilus) were determined in whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. levels of the same bacteria were also quantified in saliva using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. a significantly increased level of total salivary iga was found in the hiv-positive population (p < 0.05), but there were comparable titers of specific iga to cariogenic bacteria in hiv-positive and healthy controls. the microbiological assessment also demonstrated similar levels of cariogenic microorganisms in both groups. we conclude that hiv-positive children appear to maintain the capacity to mount a mucosal immune response to cariogenic microorganisms, at least until late stages of disease.

AB  == objective: to study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. methods: eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), provotella intermedium  (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces viscosus (av) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la) were used. these eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified bm medium supplemented with 2.5 g/l porcine gastric mucin, respectively. after 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on  removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. results: biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (p < 0.001). biofilms of aa were thinner than those of ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by ss and aa per time point. three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. conclusions: gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of gram-negative periodontal pathogens. the relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.

TI  == microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  == the first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. the organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. the patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. these agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate,  clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.

TI  == microbial ingrowth around single- and multi-component adhesives studied in vitro.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the in vitro microbial leakage in 4 micro-hybrid composites in combination with 4 single-component dental adhesives (scotchbond 1/z100 mp = group 1; syntac single-component/tetric flow = group 3; optibond solo/xrv herculite = group 5; solobond m/arabesk top = group 7) and 4 multi-component dental adhesives (scotchbond multi-purpose/z100 mp = group 2; syntac/tetric flow = group 4; optibond fl/xrv herculite = group 6; solobond plus/arabesk top = group 8). ninety-four mixed standardized class v cavities of human caries-free extracted premolars were filled with eight different composite  adhesive systems using a one-layer (groups 1-4) or a two-layer technique (groups  5-8). after thermocycling and incubation in a broth culture of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus, followed by decalcification and staining, the extent and the type of microbial leakage were measured histologically. the extent of microbial leakage in the composite restorations was very low in all groups and there were no significant differences between adhesives. z100 mp in combination with single- and multi-component adhesives showed a significantly higher microbial leakage than tetric flow systems (u test: p=0.037). xrv herculite adhesive systems showed significantly less extensive microbial leakage  than arabesk top adhesive systems (u test: p<0.001). the single-component dental  adhesives achieved a marginal adaptation of composites comparable to that of multi-component adhesives in vitro.

TI  == functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (fos), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. however, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in fos utilization by lactobacillus species. analysis of the l. acidophilus ncfm genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the laci family, a four-component atp-binding cassette (abc) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and fos but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the abc transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on fos. comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, the association between a fructosidase and an  abc transporter is unusual and may be specific to l. acidophilus. this is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of fos compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  == the objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (gic). this was assessed using an agar diffusion test. chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to fuji  ix gic at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. antibacterial-gic specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (streptococcis, lactobacillus, and actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. the experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. control specimens of the gic produced no bacterial inhibition. the antibacterial-gic combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on  week 1. ct-gic showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. the addition of antibacterial agents to fuji ix creates a gic material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.

TI  == antibacterial effect of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB  == calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatment where its main advantage consists of its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potency. however, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and low hardening, and retraction on drying. since the studies conducted by  brown and chow (iadr 1983, abst. 207), calcium phosphate-based cements (cpc) have attracted considerable interest in bone reconstruction because of their good osteoconductivity. by mixing calcium bis-dihydrogenphosphate monohydrate (mcpm) and calcium oxide with sodium phosphate buffer in the form of liquid phase, we obtained a cpc with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide. the setting reaction produced a mixture of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite and calcium hydroxide, making this cement more suitable for dental applications than  orthopedic ones. the presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antibacterial properties to this cement, which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, candida albicans (clinical isolates) and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. the cement samples tested were prepared at calcium-to-phosphate molar ratios (ca/p) ranging from 1.67 to 2.75. a pure calcium hydroxide paste was used  as reference material. clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with ca/p > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. mcpm-cao-based cement is therefore a potential candidate for pulp capping and cavity lining.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.

TI  == a mixed-bacteria ecological approach to understanding the role of the oral bacteria in dental caries causation: an alternative to streptococcus mutans and the specific-plaque hypothesis.
AB  == for more than 100 years, investigators have tried to identify the bacteria responsible for dental caries formation and to determine whether their role is one of specificity. frequent association of lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans with caries activity gave credence to their being specific cariogens. however, dental caries occurrence in their absence, and the presence of other bacteria able to produce substantial amounts of acid from fermentable carbohydrate, provided arguments for non-specificity. in the 1940s, stephan found that the mixed bacteria in dental plaque produced a rapid drop in ph following a  sugar rinse and a slow ph return toward baseline. this response became a cornerstone of plaque and mixed-bacterial involvement in dental caries causation  when stephan showed that the ph decrease was inversely and clearly related to caries activity. detailed examination of the ph (acid-base) metabolisms of oral pure cultures, dental plaque, and salivary sediment identified the main bacteria  and metabolic processes responsible for the ph metabolism of dental plaque. it was discovered that this metabolism in different individuals, in plaque in different dentition locations within individuals, and in individuals of different levels of caries activity could be described in terms of a relatively small number of acid-base metabolic processes. this led to an overall bacterial metabolic vector concept for dental plaque, and helped unravel the bacterial involvement in the degradation of the carbohydrate and nitrogenous substrates that produce the acids and alkali that affect the ph and favor and inhibit dental caries production, respectively. a central role of oral arginolytic and non-arginolytic acidogens in the production of the stephan ph curve was discovered. the non-arginolytics could produce only the ph fall part of this curve, whereas the arginolytics could produce both the fall and the rise. the net result of the latter was a less acidic stephan ph curve. both kinds of bacteria are numerous in dental plaque. by varying their ratios, we were easily able to produce stephan ph curves indicative of different levels of caries activity. this and substantial related metabolic and microbial data indicated that it is the proportions and numbers of acid-base-producing bacteria that are at the core of dental caries activity. the elimination of s. mutans, as with a vaccine, was considered to have little chance of success in preventing dental caries in humans, since, in most cases, this would simply make more room for one or more of the many acidogens remaining. an understanding of mixed-bacterial metabolism, knowledge of how to manipulate and work with mixed bacteria, and the use of a bacterial metabolic vector approach as described in this article have led to (1)  a more ecological focus for dealing with dental caries, and (2) new means of developing and evaluating anti-caries agents directed toward microbial mixtures that counter excess acid accumulation and tooth demineralization.

AB  == bacterial growth of a vegetable oil-based product was determined in vitro. growth of streptococcus mutans and veillonella alcalescens was strongly inhibited for dilutions up to 50x. on the basis of these results, it was decided to evaluate the short-term, clinical efficacy of a 1:10 dilution of the concentrated product  in water. fifteen human volunteers employed this rinse twice-a-day during a six-day period. planimetric plaque scores, as well as the plaque and gingival indexes according to loe, were assessed at the beginning and end of this period.  the efficacy of such a rinse, though less than of chlorhexidine-based products, turned out comparable to several other commercially available products with a reasonable potential in maintaining a low gingival index.

TI  == antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  == immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (sf) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. in this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the  sf from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. two atcc strains of eubacterium were also included in this assay. specific antibodies to lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus (i), (ii), streptococcus mutans, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium brachy, and eubacterium alactolyticum in the sf from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. immunodiffusion assays of the sf revealed that igg was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. the presence of  natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of orthodontic band cements].
AB  == the prevalence of enamel decalcification and caries beneath orthodontic bands, has indicated the need for a new enamel binding adhesive orthodontic cement. the  purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity, in vitro, on streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus, acidophillus, of three materials used to  cements the orthodontic bands. the cements studied were: zinc phosphate cement, glass-ionomer cement, and policarboxylate cement. thirty petri plates were seeded with s. mutans, and thirty with l. acidophillus; on each plate three pellet were  placed, one of each cement studied. petri plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37 c, and checked at 72 hrs. for streptococcus, mutans, and four days for lactobacillus acidophillus to evaluate the inhibition zone. the results were tabulated for each material. it was demonstrated that exists important variations in the antimicrobial properties of the materials studied, as in the microbial sensitivity to these cements.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a salmonella plasmid cloned in  escherichia coli k12.
AB  == the sucrose operon from pur400, a 78-kbp conjugative salmonella plasmid, was cloned in escherichia coli k12. the operon was located in a 5.7-kbp sali restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector puc18. the insert dna was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease bal31. cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. the scra (enzyme iiscr) and scrr (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp smai-sali dna fragment and were assigned the order scrb, scra, scrr. an amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. this protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 2% triton x-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. the protein did not appear to be the product of either the scra, scrb, or scrr gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. a new gene, scrc, is proposed. in addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp sali and 2.5-kbp smai-sali dna fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal dna from bacillus subtilis, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to dna from a sucrose plasmid from salmonella tennessee. however, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp ecori restriction fragment from klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == immunisation of rhesus monkeys with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid for protection against dental caries.
AB  == an attempt was made to protect rhesus monkeys from dental caries by immunisation  with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid (lta). the vaccine composed of s. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a decrease in the number of s. mutans, an increase in igg antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to lta. when lta was used as immunogen,  there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to  lta and a slight increase in igg antibodies to cell of s. mutans. vaccines of l.  acidophilus or l. fermentum gave no protection. a combined vaccine of s. mutans and l. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre  to cells of s. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the s. mutans-immunised monkeys. the results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with s. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli. more studies are required to establish the role of specific serotypes of lactobacilli  in the development of dental caries.

TI  == [dental caries].
AB  == recent studies on the etiology and prevention of dental caries are synthetized. caries is an infectious disease produced by the bacterial plaque where microorganisms act upon hydrocarbon substrate producing acids (lactic, pyruvic, acetic, etc.). these acids decalcify the enamel surface producing the carious cavity. the three types of caries are mentioned: 1. the sucrose-dependent caries  on the free surfaces of the tooth with the streptococcus mutans predominance. 2.  the pits and fissures caries with lactobacillus acidophilus predominance. 3. the  root caries with acinomyces viscosus predominance. caries prevention points out to three aspects. 1. increasing tooth resistance through the use of ingested fluoride and/or topical fluorides and pits and fissure sealants. 2. a profuse and promising research work on control of microbial plaque is being done. meanwhile,  the correct and periodically controlled toothbrushing is still the most efficient preventive measure. 3. diet control. being carbohydrates a deep rooted habit of our modern culture, its control has to be carefully evaluated. a judicious and reduced strategic consumption of carbohydrates and the use of substitutes are useful ways of achieving the preventive aims.

TI  == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
