TI  == in vitro kinetics of prebiotic inulin-type fructan fermentation by butyrate-producing colon bacteria: implementation of online gas chromatography for quantitative analysis of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas production.
AB  == kinetic analyses of bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and metabolite production of five butyrate-producing clostridial cluster xiva colon bacteria grown on acetate plus fructose, oligofructose, inulin, or lactate were performed. a gas chromatography method was set up to assess h2 and co2 production online and to ensure complete coverage of all metabolites produced. method accuracy was confirmed through the calculation of electron and carbon recoveries. fermentations with anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662(t), roseburia faecis dsm 16840(t), roseburia hominis dsm 16839(t), and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610(t) revealed similar patterns of metabolite production with butyrate, co2, and h2 as  the main metabolites. r. faecis dsm 16840(t) and r. intestinalis dsm 14610(t) were able to degrade oligofructose, displaying a nonpreferential breakdown mechanism. lactate consumption was only observed with a. caccae dsm 14662(t). roseburia inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) was the only strain included in the present  study that was able to grow on fructose, oligofructose, and inulin. the metabolites produced were lactate, butyrate, and co2, without h2 production, indicating an energy metabolism distinct from that of other roseburia species. oligofructose degradation was nonpreferential. in a coculture of r. inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) with the highly competitive strain bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum lmg 11047 on inulin, hardly any production of butyrate and co2 was detected, indicating a lack of competitiveness of the butyrate producer. complete recovery of metabolites during fermentations of clostridial cluster xiva butyrate-producing colon bacteria allowed stoichiometric balancing of the metabolic pathway for butyrate production, including h2 formation.

TI  == mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (la) were incubated with la in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and vaccenic acid (va) formation. the main cla products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-cla; ra) and trans-9,trans-11-cla, were labelled at c-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. traces of trans-10,cis-12-cla formed were labelled to a much lower extent. in pure culture, bifidobacterium breve ncfb 2258 formed labelled ra and trans-9,trans-11-cla, while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, roseburia hominis a2-183t, roseburia inulinivorans a2-192t and ruminococcus obeum-like strain a2-162 converted la to va, labelled in a manner indicating that va was formed via c-13-labelled ra. propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm 4902t, a  possible probiotic, formed mainly ra with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-cla  and trans-9,trans-11-cla, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. ricinoleic acid (12-oh-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form cla in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to cla formation described for lactobacillus plantarum. these results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of ra formation via a 10-oh-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different cla isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. a hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-oh-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-cla formation in pure and mixed cultures.

TI  == proposal of roseburia faecis sp. nov., roseburia hominis sp. nov. and roseburia inulinivorans sp. nov., based on isolates from human faeces.
AB  == seven recently cultured bacterial isolates, although similar in their 16s rrna gene sequences to roseburia intestinalis l1-82(t) (dsm 14610(t)), were not sufficiently related for inclusion within existing species, forming three separate clusters in a 16s rrna gene phylogenetic tree. the isolates, which were  obtained from human stools, were gram-variable or gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, slightly curved rods; cells from all strains measured approximately 0.5x1.5-5.0 mum and were motile. two strains belonging to one cluster (a2-181 and a2-183(t)) were the only strains that were able to grow on glycerol and that failed to grow on any of the complex substrates tested (inulin, xylan and amylopectin). strains belonging to a second cluster (represented by m6/1 and m72/1(t)) differed from the other isolates in their ability to grow on sorbitol.  isolates belonging to a third cluster (l1-83 and a2-194(t)) were the only strains that failed to grow on xylose and that gave good growth on inulin (strains m6/1 and m72/1(t) gave weak growth). all strains were net acetate utilizers. the dna g+c contents of representative roseburia strains a2-183(t), a2-194(t), m72/1(t) and r. intestinalis l1-82(t) were 47.4, 41.4, 42.0 and 42.6 mol%, respectively. based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, three novel roseburia species are proposed, with the names roseburia hominis sp. nov. (type strain a2-183(t)=dsm 16839(t)=ncimb 14029(t)), roseburia inulinivorans sp. nov. (type strain a2-194(t)=dsm 16841(t)=ncimb 14030(t)) and roseburia faecis sp. nov. (type strain m72/1(t)=dsm 16840(t)=ncimb 14031(t)).
