TI  == interaction of the rumen fungus orpinomyces joyonii with megasphaera elsdenii and eubacterium limosum.
AB  == the degradation and fermentation of microcrystalline cellulose were studied in monoculture of the polycentric anaerobic fungus orpinomyces joyonii and in co-cultures with the rumen bacteria megasphaera elsdenii and eubacterium limosum. more than 25% of cellulose hydrolysis products (glucose and cellodextrins) were released by the fungus into the medium after 8 d of cultivation. these products were metabolized by bacteria in mixed cultures. in co-culture with the fungus m.  elsdenii and e. limosum increased the extent of microcrystalline cellulose degradation by 10.12% and 7.96%, respectively. biomass yield in co-cultures was increased by 89.9% and 59.4% for m. elsdenii and e. limosum. y cellulose for fungus alone was 52.29 g dry matter mol-1 glucose. these values were 64.93 and 55.92 g mol-1 glucose unit in co-culture with m. elsdenii and e. limosum, respectively.
