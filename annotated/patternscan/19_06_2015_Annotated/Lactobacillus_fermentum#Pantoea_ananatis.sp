TI  == [effects of a lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 treated on rice straw].
AB  == aimed to utilize rice straw and lessen the pressure of environment, the rice straw was used as the fermentation material, and a lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 from my laboratory was inoculated into the rice straw to investigate the inoculation effects. after 30 days fermentation, the inoculated fermented straw smelt acid-fragrant, and the ph value was 3.8, which was lower than the control of 4.1. furthermore, lactic acid concentration was more than that in the control. especially l-lactic acid concentration was two times more than in the control, and the crude protein content was 10.16% higher than that in the control, and the crude fiber content was 3.2% lower than that in the control. from the patterns of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei rapidly became the advantageous species in the inoculated straws. however, enterobacter sakazakii, pantoea agglomerans, enterobacter endosymbiont, pantoea ananatis, whichwere predominate in the controls, were not detected in the inoculated straws, and the  fermented quality was improved significantly.
