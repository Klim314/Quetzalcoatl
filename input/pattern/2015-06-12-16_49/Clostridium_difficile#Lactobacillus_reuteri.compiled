TI  - Probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. Diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. This review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. Rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (not GG), and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. In the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of India, again with modest efficacy. Previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. More recently, a large trial in Poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for Lactobacillus GG. The prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both in children and in adults. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium ssp, Streptococcus ssp, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. As for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. The vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. Such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day. The effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.
TI  - The antimicrobial compound reuterin (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde) induces oxidative  stress via interaction with thiol groups.
AB  - Reuterin is an antimicrobial compound produced by Lactobacillus reuteri, and has  been proposed to mediate, in part, the probiotic health benefits ascribed to this micro-organism. Despite 20 years of investigation, the mechanism of action by which reuterin exerts its antimicrobial effects has remained elusive. Here we provide evidence that reuterin induces oxidative stress in cells, most likely by modifying thiol groups in proteins and small molecules. Escherichia coli cells subjected to sublethal levels of reuterin expressed a set of genes that overlapped with the set of genes composing the OxyR regulon, which senses and responds to various forms of oxidative stress. E. coli cells mutated for oxyR were more sensitive to reuterin compared with wild-type cells, further supporting a role for reuterin in exerting oxidative stress. The addition of cysteine to E. coli or Clostridium difficile growth media prior to exposure to reuterin suppressed the antimicrobial effect of reuterin on these bacteria. Interestingly, interaction with E. coli stimulated reuterin production or secretion by L. reuteri, indicating that contact with other microbes in the gut increases reuterin output. Thus, reuterin inhibits bacterial growth by modifying thiol groups, which indicates that reuterin negatively affects a large number of cellular targets.
TI  - Probiotic lactobacilli in breast milk and infant stool in relation to oral intake during the first year of life.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This is to identify factors affecting the prevalence of Lactobacillus reuteri in maternal faeces and breast milk and infant faeces after oral supplementation with L reuteri and to assess the influence on microbial ecology, particularly Clostridium difficile and Bifidobacterium colonization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind trial, 232 mothers with a family history of atopic disease were randomized to a daily intake of either L reuteri American-type culture collection (ATCC) 55730 (1 x 10 colony-forming units [CFU]) or placebo for the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. Their babies then continued with the same study product daily from birth until 12 months of age. Bacterial counts and prevalence were assessed in maternal breast milk and faeces and infant faeces, using conventional cultivation methods. RESULTS: The prevalence of L reuteri was higher during the first year of life in the stool samples from infants in the active as compared with the placebo-treated group. The highest prevalence was recorded at 5 to 6 days of age (82% in the treated vs 20% in the placebo group, P < 0.001). Lactobacillus reuteri was isolated from 12% and 2%, respectively, in the colostrum samples (P < 0.05). Breast-feeding seemed to reduce faecal L reuteri counts, although antibiotics did not influence the levels of L reuteri. The administration of L reuteri did not affect bifidobacteria or C difficile colonization. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus reuteri may be detected in breast milk after oral supplementation to the mother and in almost all infants after oral supplementation during the first year of life, as well as occasionally in many untreated infants.
TI  - Probiotics for children with diarrhea: an update.
AB  - This review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus), and Lactobacillus reuteri. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. Few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or Clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. Overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. On the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. Most commonly employed probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. They consistently show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii, but also L. reuteri-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. Such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. The effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10 billion/d being necessary.
TI  - Probiotics and infectious diarrhea.
AB  - Numerous probiotic agents have been studied for the management of diarrheal disease. In particular, the prevention and management of acute viral diarrhea, the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea, as well as the control of antibiotic-associated diarrhea seem to be areas of significant potential benefit. A few agents, including Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Saccharomyces boulardii, seem to be promising agents for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhea in children when used therapeutically. The use of other agents, particularly Bifidobacteria, supplementing the regular feed of infants may have an effect as prophylactic agents against acute diarrheal diseases. In general, in pediatric populations, the effect of probiotic agents appears to be most significant against viral (rotaviral) diarrhea, suggesting that an immunological mechanism is responsible for the beneficial effects. The numerous agents, doses, and populations used make generalization difficult. Nevertheless, it is clear probiotic agents are becoming an important part of the armamentarium against gastrointestinal problems in infants and children.
