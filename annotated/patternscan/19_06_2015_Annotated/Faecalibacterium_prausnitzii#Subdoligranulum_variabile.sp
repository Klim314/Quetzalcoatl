TI  == [16s rrna gene-based molecular methods to monitor clostridium cluster iv community in the colon of piglets].
AB  == objective: to investigate the change of clostridium cluster iv community in the colon of piglets from 7 to 35 days of age, and its correlation with butyrate concentration. methods: three litters of neonatal piglets were used. one piglet from each litter was sacrificed randomly at the age of 7, 14, 21 (weaning day), 24 and 35 days, digestive samples in the colon were collected. the concentration  of volatile fatty acid (vfa) was determined by gas chromatography. 16s rrna gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr were  used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of clostridium cluster iv community. results: similarity analysis of dgge profile revealed that samples from piglets at the age of 7 days formed a coherent cluster with indices above 90%, no significant changes in clostridium cluster iv community were found around weaning period. real-time pcr analysis showed that 16s rrna gene copies of total  bacteria in the colon of piglets decreased significantly 3 days after weaning, this tendency was in accordance with the changes in concentration of total vfa and butyrate in colon, while there was no significant difference in copies of clostridium cluster iv group. sequencing analysis indicated that clostridium cluster iv group in the colon of piglets were dominated by faecalibacterium prausnitzii, subdoligranulum variabile and other uncultured bacteria. conclusion: changes in clostridium cluster iv community in the colon of piglets were found from the age of 7 days to 14 days, while there was no significant difference during the weaning transition.

TI  == quantification of faecalibacterium prausnitzii- and subdoligranulum variabile-like bacteria in the cecum of chickens by real-time pcr.
AB  == the intestinal microbial community is playing an important role in health and production performance of chickens. to understand the effect on the intestinal microflora induced by various feeding strategies, feed additives, infections, and intestinal disorders, it is important to have methods for quantifying potentially important bacteria in the intestine. we describe a real-time quantitative assay for detection and quantification of a whole group of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and subdoligranulum variabile-like bacteria, which has recently been found to dominate in the cecum of broiler chickens. the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria were quantified using a multiprobe assay in which one primer set was used to amplify dna from all bacteria, whereas 2 probes detected all bacteria and the group of f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria, respectively. the multiprobe assay accurately quantified the percentage of this group in a sample if it constituted more than approximately 5% of the total bacterial community. if the fraction of f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria was lower than 5%, a duplex assay was applied in which the total bacteria were amplified in one tube and the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like group of bacteria was amplified in another tube using a specific forward primer. the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like group of bacteria was quantified in the cecum and ileum of conventional and organic raised chickens, in chickens kept in an isolator from 1  d of age, and in hatcher material. quantification of this group of f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like bacteria has not been performed before by real-time pcr, but results confirm previous results obtained by cloning and sequencing showing that the f. prausnitzii-s. variabile-like group of bacteria constitutes a major fraction of the cecal bacterial community in chickens. furthermore, results indicate that the poultry farm environment plays a role in recruitment and development of these bacteria in the intestinal microflora.

TI  == molecular profiling of the clostridium leptum subgroup in human fecal microflora  by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis.
AB  == a group-specific pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method  was developed and combined with group-specific clone library analysis to investigate the diversity of the clostridium leptum subgroup in human feces. pcr  products (length, 239 bp) were amplified using c. leptum cluster-specific primers and were well separated by dgge. the dgge patterns of fecal amplicons from 11 human individuals revealed host-specific profiles; the patterns for fecal samples collected from a child for 3 years demonstrated the structural succession of the  population in the first 2 years and its stability in the third year. a clone library was constructed with 100 clones consisting of 1,143-bp inserts of 16s rrna gene fragments that were amplified from one adult fecal dna with one forward universal bacterial primer and one reverse group-specific primer. eighty-six of the clones produced the 239-bp c. leptum cluster-specific amplicons, and the remaining 14 clones did not produce these amplicons but still phylogenetically belong to the subgroup. sixty-four percent of the clones were related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii (similarity, 97 to 99%), 6% were related to subdoligranulum variabile (similarity, approximately 99%), 2% were related to butyrate-producing bacterium a2-207 (similarity, 99%), and 28% were not identified at the species level. the identities of most bands in the dgge profiles for the same adult were determined by comigration analysis with the 86 clones that harbored the 239-bp group-specific fragments. our results suggest that dgge combined with clone library analysis is an effective technique for monitoring and analyzing the composition of this important population in the human gut flora.

TI  == subdoligranulum variabile gen. nov., sp. nov. from human feces.
AB  == during studies on the microflora of human feces we have isolated a strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-negative staining organism which exhibits a somewhat variable coccus-shaped morphology. comparative 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism is phylogenetically a member of the clostridium leptum supra-generic rrna cluster and displays a close affinity to some rdna clones derived from human and pig feces. the nearest named relatives of the unidentified isolate corresponded to faecalibacterium prausnitzii (formerly fusobacterium prausnitzii) displaying a 16s rrna sequence divergence of approximately 9%, with anaerofilum agile and a. pentosovorans the next closest relatives of the unidentified bacterium (sequence divergence approximately 10%).  based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unusual coccoid-shaped organism be classified as a new genus and species, subdoligranulum variabile. the type strain of s. variabile is bi 114(t) (=ccug 47106(t)=dsm 15176(t)).
