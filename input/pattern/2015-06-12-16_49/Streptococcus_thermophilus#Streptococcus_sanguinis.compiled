TI  - Salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (CD) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [T-CD]). The same number of healthy children (HC) was used as controls. The salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. Metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the T-CD children. As shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest Shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in HC. Pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for HC. Levels of Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, and Streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the T-CD children. Streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in T-CD children. The saliva of T-CD children showed the largest amount of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of Actinobacteria. T-CD children were also characterized by decreased levels of some Actinomyces species, Atopobium species, and Corynebacterium durum. Rothia mucilaginosa was the only Actinobacteria species found at the highest level in T-CD children. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated T-CD children. Some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with T-CD children. Correlations (false discovery rate [FDR], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings of this study indicated that CD is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - Identification of genes for small non-coding RNAs that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system CiaRH in Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-transcriptional regulation by small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first sRNAs to be described were found in the regulon of the CiaRH two-component regulatory system. Five of these sRNAs were detected and designated csRNAs for cia-dependent small RNAs. CiaRH pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. Since CiaRH is highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csRNAs are also included in the CiaRH regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. Knowledge on the participation of csRNAs in CiaRH-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological role of this important control system. RESULTS: Genes for csRNAs were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than S. pneumoniae by searching for CiaR-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csRNAs ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. Comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csRNA types. All streptococcal genomes harbored csRNA genes, their numbers varying between two and six. To validate these predictions, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. sanguinis were subjected to csRNA-specific northern blot analysis. In addition, a csRNA gene from S. thermophilus plasmid pST0 introduced into S. pneumoniae was also tested. Each of the csRNAs was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. Thus, the method applied here is able to predict csRNAs with high precision. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding RNAs, csRNAs, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory system CiaRH in all streptococci.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. It is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. The present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. DESIGN: The sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains. Each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. Two strains of each of the following Streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. One millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees C, 60min) with 9mL of fat-free plain yoghurt containing Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. Survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. RESULTS: Survival rates were 8% (S. mutans 6519T), 12% (S. mutans 31738), 35% (S. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (S. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. Overall, S. parasanguinis and S. sobrinus were the most resistant species. When heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. CONCLUSION: In vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on S. mutans but not on S. sobrinus.
TI  - Identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating SOS mutagenesis in Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - Streptococci have been considered to lack the classical SOS response, defined by  increased mutation after UV exposure and regulation by LexA. Here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated SOS mutagenesis gene cassette in the Streptococcaceae family. Exposure to UV light was found to increase mutations to antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus uberis cultures. The mutational spectra revealed mainly G:C-->A:T transitions, and Northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a Y-family DNA polymerase resembling UmuC under DNA-damaging conditions. In the absence of the Y-family polymerase, S. uberis cells were sensitive to UV light and to mitomycin C. Furthermore, the UV-induced mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the Y-family polymerase. The gene encoding the Y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a HdiR homolog. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that S. uberis HdiR binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. Database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several Streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus thermophilus strains. In addition, the umuC operon was localized in several mobile DNA elements of Streptococcus and Lactococcus species. We conclude that the hdiR-umuC-ORF3-ORF4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating SOS mutagenesis among members of the Streptococcaceae.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - Genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. We previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsA to epsM) responsible for EPS production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6. Here we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to EPS production. Mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce EPS, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. The predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class B penicillin-binding proteins 2b of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the E. coli folD and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in DNA repair. Downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the Bacillus subtilis and the Escherichia coli recM or recR which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent DNA mismatch repair. In S. thermophilus, pbp2b and recM were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mRNAs and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.
TI  - The presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  - The protein, HPr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in bacteria, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. The purified preparation gave only one band when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pI = 4.85). However, electrophoresis in Tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of enzyme I of the PTS or by ATP with the HPr kinase. Homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained by preparative electrophoresis. Each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. The electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees C for several months. Both HPr proteins catalyzed in vitro the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with a preparation of HPr containing both forms of the protein. Both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from PEP to the other specific PTS proteins known in S salivarius. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. The presence of the 2 forms of HPr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of S salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. A doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (S mutans, S sobrinus, S sanguis, S thermophilus, S bovis, S rattus) and also in L lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
