TI  == multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates in infected wounds at jimma university specialized hospital, ethiopia.
AB  == background: the term 'multidrug-resistant' (mdr) applies to a bacterium that is simultaneously resistant to a number of antimicrobials belonging to different chemical classes. the effectiveness of currently available antmicrobial drugs is  decreasing due to the increasing number of resistant strains causing infections so that available therapeutic options for such organisms are severely limited. objective: the aim of this study was to determine multidrug-resistance rate of bacterial isolates that caused wound infections. methods: a hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted on 322 wound samples taken from consecutive patients seen at inpatient and outpatient department of jimma university specialized hospital from june to december 2011. swabs from surgical incisions, burns, abscess and traumatic wounds were collected aseptically using levine's technique. bacteriological culture and examination was done following standard microbiological techniques. multidrug-resistance test was performed by disk diffusion method against 10 classes of antimicrobials. the data was analyzed for  descriptive statistics using spss version 16 and microsoft excel. results: the overall mdr among gram positive and gram negative bacterial isolates were (77%) and (59.3%) respectively. about, 86.2% s.aureus and 28.6% of coagulase negative staphylococci became mdr. nearly 30.1% of s.aureus was resistant to six classes of antimicrobials. the average mdr rate of proteus, klebsiella, and providencia species was 74.8%, 69.6% and 75% in that order. nearly, 30.8% of proteus sp, 32.6% of klebsiella sp and 61% of citrobacter sp were resistance to 4 classes each. surprisingly, the average mdr rate for citrobacter sp was 100%. about (76.7%) of s.aureus was oxacillin/methicillin resistant while (16.4%) were vancomycin resistant. proteus species was the predominant isolates (27.9%) followed by p.aeruginosa and s.aureus (19.3%) and (19%) respectively. conclusion: this study indicated that, the overall rate of mdr bacterial pathogens that caused wound infection was very high and many of the isolates were also identified as resistant to three or more classes of antimicrobials. such widespread resistance to antimicrobial classes is something serious because a few treatment options remain for patients with wound infections. periodic monitoring  of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in areas where there is no culture facility is essential to assists physician in selection of chemotherapy.

TI  == a survey of veterinary hospitals in nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents against 2,085 clinical isolates tested in 13 brazilian centers.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is the second agent of its class to become available in brazil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. this study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 brazilian states. a total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested using the etest and following the nccls procedures. meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/ml, except for citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (mic50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (mic 50,3 microg/ml). imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some gram-positive specees oxacillin, including enterococcus faecalis (mic 50 of 0.75 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml respectively), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/ml and 0.094 microg/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (mic 50 of 0.064 microg/ml and 0.5mg/ml). against streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (mic 50, 0.016 microg/ml). the results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.

TI  == [the resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == [bacteriological and clinical break points: evaluation of the usefulness of cefozopran based on mic].
AB  == drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria to cefozopran (czop), which is a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated, and the usefulness of the drug was evaluated from the viewpoint of bacteriological and clinical (pneumonia) break points. the following results were obtained. 1. according to bacteriological break points, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus spp. showed low sensitivity to cefozopran (czop). however, the sensitivity of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), e. coli, and klebsiella spp., which are often isolated as pathogens of common infections, was 100%, that of enterobacter spp., serratia sp., and citrobacter sp. was 90% or higher, and that  of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 80% or higher; the values were comparable to or better than those for ceftazidime (caz). these results suggest a expanded antibacterial spectrum and enhanced antibacterial potency of czop. 2. the estimated response rate of pneumonia to czop was 87.5% in outpatients and 51.9% in inpatients. therefore, czop is considered to be one of the first choices especially in outpatient empiric therapy.

TI  == the bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in ile-ife, nigeria.
AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of g1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  == g1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against gram-positive and  -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. a compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. we tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. the following are mic50, mic90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: e. coli 16, 16, 4 32; klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; staphylococcus aureus  8, 16, 4-16; streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. mic values appear lower for gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. g1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == bacterial isolates from indigenous weaning foods in rural ethiopian setting, jimma zone, south west ethiopia.
AB  == a community based bacteriological study of weaning foods was conducted from november 1994 to august 1995 in six peasant associations, jimma zone. the households in the study community were found to be in poor sanitary conditions with cattle and pets living in the same room with humans, and the community gets  water from unprotected sources. the predominant weaning foods in the study community were cereals. these and other foods given to weaning age children were  found to be grossly contaminated, aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts being 10(5) cfu/ml of sample. the most frequent bacterial isolates were enterobacter sp, gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp.,  and escherichia coli in that order. various factors such as unsafe water, unhygienic handling of food, storage of food at ambient temperature for a long time, poor domestic and personal hygiene may have contributed for the gross contamination of weaning foods in the study community. this calls for educating the community on the relationship between contamination of weaning foods and diarrhoeal diseases, and promoting measures such as reheating of weaning foods which have been kept at ambient temperature for a long time before serving infants and children.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == [clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, serratia liquefaciens, and aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of staphylococcus sp., one each of streptococcus sp. and streptococcus pneumoniae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas sp. were not detected. resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. as a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. this  study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. the combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.

TI  == in vitro brodimoprim activity on nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  == the activity of brodimoprim, a new diaminopyrimidine, against 385 recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli was in vitro tested by  the disk sensitivity test (dst) of bauer et al. with disk concentration of 2.5 micrograms and by the agar dilution method. the postantibiotic effect (pae) and the postantibiotic leukocyte killing enhancement (pale) were determined on selected pathogens. the mics were determined with muller hinton ii agar (bd) and  a multipoint inoculator (denley a 400); thymidine phosphorylase (0.08 u/ml) was added to the test agar. brodimoprim was very active against s. pyogenes (27), salmonella sp. (30), methicillin susceptible s. aureus (36) and e. faecalis (34). the geometric means (gm) of mics ranged from 0.08 to 0.63 and % of resistance from 0.0 to 14.7. higher mics (gm from 1.02 to 2.67) were shown against citrobacter sp. (32), klebsiella sp. (27), e. coli (36), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (33), enterobacter sp. (32), proteus sp. (31) and methicillin-susceptible  coagulase negative staphylococci (34); resistant strains ranged from 18.7 to 41.2%. the in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (33) (72.7% of resistance to brodimoprim) was very low. regression  analysis, obtained correlating the results of mics with those of agar diffusion,  shows that the resistant strains have a diameter less than 11 mm, the intermediate ones a diameter of 11-13 mm and susceptible strains a diameter greater than 13 mm. the pae was determined using the abbott avantage system. strains were exposed to brodimoprim (1/4 x mic - 4 x mic range) for 2 or 6 h.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a newly developed product, ks-r1 (a suppository containing 250 mg potency of ampicillin (abpc)), was given to 7 children (5 boys and 2 girls) ranging from 4 years and 5 months to 8 years and 10 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily  dose, 62.4 mg/kg) for 5 days. as a control, the same amount of abpc dry syrup was given orally to 7 children (4 boys and 3 girls) ranging from 2 years and 8 months to 7 years and 7 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 55.3 mg/kg) for 5 days. the effects of these 2 preparations on the bacterial flora of the feces were investigated, and concentrations of abpc in the feces and sensitivities of the isolated strains to abpc were determined. the results were as follows. as for gram-negative bacilli in the feces from children given ks-r1,  there was no change in escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. which were isolated from many children 3 days after the end of treatment, but they did not show any constant pattern of change in mean number. other species did not show any pattern of increase in the number of children from whom they were isolated, or in the number of bacteria during the course after the beginning of treatment. the total number of bacteria identified as enterobacteriaceae was at the level of 10(8) cells/g on any day of examination. of gram-negative bacilli other than enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas sp. showed no constant pattern of change in number. on the other hand, of gram-positive bacteria, there was no constant pattern of change in the number of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci began to be isolated from many children  5 days after the beginning of treatment and were isolated from all children 5 days after the end of treatment, but there was no tendency for the mean number to increase. enterococcus sp. was not isolated from 3 children 3 days after the beginning of treatment, and was decreased in number by one order in 3 out of other 4 children as compared with before-treatment. however, this species was isolated from all children 3 days after the end of treatment, and the mean number of bacteria was similar to that before-treatment although the number of bacteria  was different in individual children.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  == the in vivo activity of cefodizime (hr 221) was compared with that of cefotaxime  (ctx), cefmenoxime, latamoxef, cefazolin and cefmetazole (cmz). the protective effects of hr 221 on experimental infections in mice caused by staphylococcus aureus smith, escherichia coli c-11, proteus vulgaris gn-76 and serratia marcescens no. 2 were directly related to its in vitro activity against these strains. in contrast, the compound showed the smallest ed50 values, among the 5 antibiotics tested (not including cmz), for klebsiella pneumoniae 3k-25 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pi 67 against which it had relatively low in vitro activity, and its ed50 for citrobacter freundii gn-346 was as small as 1.821 mg/mouse in spite of its mic of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. hr 221 exerted potent bactericidal activity against streptococcus pneumoniae sp-1 inoculated into the mouse lung; the duration of action was prolonged. when tested against the e. coli ec-89 infection induced in the rat uterus, the activity of hr 221 given to rats once daily was equal to that of ctx or cmz given at the same dose twice daily.

TI  == [sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the pitie-salpetriere hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == cefoperazone in the treatment of postsurgical wound infection, sepsis, and abscess of the spinal cord and brain.
AB  == cefoperazone was used in the treatment of 23 cases of serious bacterial infection in 20 patients. ten postoperative scalp wound infections, five infections at the  site of tracheostomy, four cases of extradural spinal cord abscess, three cases of sepsis, and one abscess of the cerebellopontine angle were treated with cefoperazone (1 to 2 gm bid, usually for seven to 27 days). there were excellent  or good clinical responses in 87% (20/23) of the cases (14 of the 15 postsurgical wound infections, three of the four cases of spinal cord abscess, and all three cases of sepsis). most of the organisms isolated from the patients' cultures were sensitive to cefoperazone. excellent or good responses occurred in ten of the 12  infections due to staphylococcus aureus, in all three infections due to pseudomonas sp, all three due to citrobacter freundii, the two due to serratia marcescens, one of the two due to klebsiella sp, and the one due to escherichia coli. two patients with ventriculitis were clinically improved by three 1-gm infusions, via a shunt, of cefoperazone. no adverse effects of the antibiotic therapy were reported.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

TI  == isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis nelsoni and o. c. mexicana) in arizona.
AB  == nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. a total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. one hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included bacillus sp. (36%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), s. aureus (4%), corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included neisseria sp. (18%), citrobacter sp. (3%), enterobacter sp. (2%), escherichia coli (2%), proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) (73%). of the nfb isolates, pseudomonas sp. (25%), acinetobacter sp. (18%), moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  == the susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. the three strains of listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. there was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of salmonellae, citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas sp. cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus sp., providence sp., flavobacter sp., herellea vaginicola, and mima polymorpha. cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against bacteroides sp. thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
