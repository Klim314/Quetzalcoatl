antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, eupenicillium sp.  lg41.
two new compounds containing the decalin moiety, eupenicinicols a and b (1 and 2), two new sirenin derivatives, eupenicisirenins a and b (3 and 4), and four known compounds, (2s)-butylitaconic acid (5), (2s)-hexylitaconic acid (6), xanthomegnin (7), and viridicatumtoxin (8), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, eupenicillium sp. lg41, harbored in the roots of the chinese medicinal plant xanthium sibiricum. their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (nmr and hrms(n)), and their absolute configurations were deduced by ecd calculations or optical rotation data. since the endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots, the antibacterial efficacies of the compounds 1-6 were investigated against bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter sp. bd4, which typically inhabit soil, as well as the clinically important staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. (2s)-butylitaconic acid (5) and (2s)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. compound 2 was highly active against the clinically relevant s. aureus. by comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at c-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. our study reveals plausible ecological roles of the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.
penialidins a-c with strong antibacterial activities from penicillium sp., an endophytic fungus harboring leaves of garcinia nobilis.
three new polyketides named penialidins a-c (1-3), along with one known compound, citromycetin (4), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, penicillium sp., harbored in the leaves of the cameroonian medicinal plant garcinia nobilis. their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods (nmr and hrms(n)). the antibacterial efficacies of the new compounds (1-3) were tested against the clinically-important risk group 2 (rg2) bacterial strains of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the ecologically imposing strains of e. coli (rg1), bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter sp. bd4 were also included in the assay. compound 3 exhibited pronounced activity against the clinically-relevant s. aureus as well as against b. subtilis comparable to that of the reference standard (streptomycin). compound 2 was also highly-active against s. aureus. by comparing the structures of the three new compounds (1-3), it was revealed that altering the substitutions at c-10 and c-2 can significantly increase the antibacterial activity of 1.
antimicrobial activity of terminalia arjuna wight & arn.: an ethnomedicinal plant against pathogens causing ear infection.
ear infection is one of the common diseases occurring throughout the world. different etiological agents are responsible for ear infections. aim: to assess the antimicrobial potential of terminalia arjuna leaves and bark extracts against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, escherchia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, pathogens causing ear infections and their comparison with locally available ear drops. materials and methods: methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the leaves and bark of t. arjuna were tested for their antimicrobial activity. results: of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic leaf extract was found to be best against s. aureus. organic bark extract showed almost equal inhibition of all tested gram negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. however, aqueous extract of t. arjuna bark exhibited good activity against s. aureus. all the extracts were unable to exhibit any antifungal activity. conclusion: organic extract obtained from the t. arjuna bark and leaves may be used to treat the bacterial ear pathogens especially s. aureus, which has shown greater inhibition zones than the herbal drops, however, we still need more detailed studies as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties for their therapeutic utility in treating ear infections.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
background: with the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. we aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. methods: between july 2008 and august 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a taiwan medical center were enrolled. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with vitek-2 system and was analyzed according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. we followed usa food and drug administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. results: the median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. after tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. a baumannii and p aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. the tigecycline susceptibility rate of a baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. conclusion: the most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were a baumannii and p aeruginosa. tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of a baumannii, methicillin-resistant s aureus, e coli, and k pneumoniae. exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of a baumannii for tigecycline.
identification of streptomyces sp. kh29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
the actinomycete strain kh29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus streptomyces. by way of its noted 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, kh29 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces cinnamonensis. the production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including ms and nmr as a cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). cyclo(l-trp-l-trp), from the py cultures of kh29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, cyclo(ltrp- l-trp) had antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus niger, and candida albicans, however, it was ineffective against streptomyces murinus.
copper(ii) complexes with ligands derived from 4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one: synthesis and biological activity.
the synthesis of cu(ii) complexes derived from schiff base ligands obtained by the condensation of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde or terephtalic aldehyde with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one) is presented. the newly prepared compounds were characterized by( 1)h-nmr, uv-vis, ir and esr spectroscopy. the determination of the antimicrobial activity of the ligands and of the complexes was carried out on samples of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter boumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and candida sp. the qualitative and quantitative antimicrobial activity test results proved that all the prepared complexes are very active, especially against samples of ps. aeruginosa, a. boumanii, e. coli and s. aureus.
characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
effects of cytokines and endotoxin on the intracellular growth of bacteria.
patients with unresolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) have persistently elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and circulation and increased rates of bacterial infections. phagocytic cells hyperactivated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), which induces high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells, are inefficient in killing ingested bacteria despite having intact phagocytic activity. on the other hand, phagocytic cells that are activated with an analogue of lps that does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines effectively ingest and kill bacteria. we hypothesized that in the presence of high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, bacteria may adapt and utilize cytokines to their growth advantage. to test our hypothesis, we primed a human monocytic cell line (u937) with escalating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), and il-6 and with lps. these cells were then exposed to fresh isolates of three common nosocomial pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an acinetobacter sp. in human monocytes primed with lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (10 to 250 pg) or lps (1 and 10 ng), intracellular bacterial growth decreased. however, when human monocytes were primed with higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (1 to 10 ng) or lps (1 to 10 micrograms), intracellular growth of the tested bacteria increased significantly (p <0.0001). these results were reproduced with peripheral blood monocytes obtained from normal healthy volunteers. the specificity of the cytokine activity was demonstrated by neutralizing the cytokines with specific antibodies. our findings provide a possible mechanism to explain the frequent development of bacterial infections in patients with an intense and protracted inflammatory response.
hospital acquired infections in a singapore hospital: 1985-1992.
a prospective survey of hospital-acquired infections (hai) was conducted from 1985 to 1992. the survey used laboratory results to estimate incidence and alert infection control staff to a need for further action. the results were analysed with regard to the site, speciality and type of organism. the distribution by speciality of patients who had methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus infections was compared with the distribution of all patients with hai. although the surveillance was only partial, the data collected from year to year over the period of study seemed constant. the distribution of infection by type, location and bacterial cause was similar to results from other parts of the world. notable differences were the high incidence of acinetobacter sp., and the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used agents. over half the staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant.
ampicillin/sulbactam in lower respiratory tract infections: a review.
the pathophysiology and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infections are outlined and diagnostic and therapeutic problems considered. the use of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of these infections is evaluated. the two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics; predictable and dose-dependent peak serum concentrations of both agents are achieved after parenteral administration. more than 90% of strains of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella sp, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter sp were inhibited by ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations of 16/8 micrograms/ml. serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam were 18 to 28 micrograms/ml and 13 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intramuscular administration of 1 gm/0.5 gm of ampicillin/sulbactam and 58 micrograms/ml and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intravenous administration of the same dose. good distribution of ampicillin/sulbactam into lung tissue, sputum, and bronchial fluid has been demonstrated. in over 2,250 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, the rate of discontinuance of treatment because of side effects was less than 1%. satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic outcome has been reported in over 80% of patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. the cost of ampicillin/sulbactam treatment is generally lower than that of other comparable antibiotic regimens.
effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
comparative antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a, a derivative of fortimicin a.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
