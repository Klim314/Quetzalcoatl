TI  == quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  == various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qpcr in a single cohort. we quantify these bacteria (fusobacterium  spp., streptococcus gallolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), and afac-  or pks-positive e. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. we further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and msi-status. with the exception of s. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. etbf (fdr = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afac-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. etbf (fdr = 0.04 and  0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and fusobacterium spp. (fdr =  0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (iii/iv) colorectal cancers. fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). we also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by fusobacterium and msi-h (fdr = 0.05), age (fdr = 0.03) or pks-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.01). furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical epec in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. by quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of fusobacterium and etbf.

TI  == enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated  uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of  antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by  multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women.  on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the  different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti  with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st  16 in acute uti.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in european hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance  (2003-2009).
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the european medicines agency (emea) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cssti) and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro  activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). a total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 european  countries, turkey and israel. the collection included s. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [mrsa]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 6,874), enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107).  the organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cssti (23%). daptomycin was very active against s. aureus and cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (mic(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). daptomycin (mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and s. bovis (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).in summary, daptomycin was very  potent against this large collection (36,769) of gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period  evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since emea approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary gram-positive species.

TI  == impact of susceptibility to antibiotics of streptococci & enterococci isolated from patients with infective endocarditis on antibiotic treatment.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococci and enterococci are the most frequent pathogens causing infective endocarditis. in order to update the recommendations  for both curative and prophylaxis treatment, the susceptibility to antibiotics of the most prevalent species of streptococcaceae isolated from the patients with infective endocarditis was determined. methods: streptococcal and enterococcal isolates (n=133) isolated from confirmed cases of infective endocarditis during a one-year prospective survey conducted in 1999 in france were studied. the identification of 106 streptococci and 27 enterococci to the species level was carried out by conventional methods. their susceptibility to ten antibiotics used in curative or prophylactic treatment was measured. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method. results: all the streptococcal and enterococcal isolates were susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of penicillin or amoxicillin. high levels of resistance to aminoglycosides were observed in two species, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus and enterococcus faecalis. all isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides. resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and pristinamycin was restricted to some species. interpretation & conclusion: curative treatments recommended for streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis, including penicillin, amoxicillin or vancomycin in association with gentamicin were found to be appropriate for 98.5 per cent of cases. the emergence of erythromycin resistance in oral streptococci led to the use of pristinamycin in oral prophylactic treatment in patients allergic to beta-lactams.

TI  == transferable vanb2 tn5382-containing elements in fecal streptococcal strains from veal calves.
AB  == three vancomycin-resistant veal calf fecal streptococci, identified as streptococcus gallolyticus (n = 2) and streptococcus lutetiensis, were shown to harbor vanb2 tn5382-like elements earlier described in enterococci. one s. gallolyticus strain had a 1,495-bp is256-related element inserted in vans(b). the vanb2 tn5382 element present in the plasmid-free s. lutetiensis strain was transferable to enterococcus faecium bm4105-rf, enterococcus faecalis jh2-2, and  its recombination-deficient derivative, uv202. the transfer frequencies were comparable between recipient strains (from 1 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-6)). all transconjugants acquired a vanb-containing chromosomal insert of approximately 100 kb, apparently by site-specific integration. secondary transconjugants were not observed in intraspecies retransfer experiments. these observations are consistent with a conjugative, selftransmissible, integrative element that might  be involved in the interspecies spread of vanb2 resistance determinants. two jh2-2-derived transconjugants had also gained additional copies of large vanb-containing chromosomal fragments, a process that involves unexplained mechanisms that seems to require functional host cell-dependent recombination mechanisms.

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.

TI  == identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  == aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. the results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. s. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) aerococcus  viridans, streptococcus pluranimalium, lactococcus garvieae, streptococcus bovis  and streptococcus gallolyticus.
