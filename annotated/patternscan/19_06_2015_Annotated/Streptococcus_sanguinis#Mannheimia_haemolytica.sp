TI  == diversity of bacterial species in the nasal cavity of sheep in the highlands of ethiopia and first report of histophilus somni in the country.
AB  == a study was conducted to isolate bacterial species/pathogens from the nasal cavity of apparently healthy and pneumonic sheep. nasal swabs were collected aseptically, transported in tryptose soya broth and incubated for 24 h. then, each swab was streaked onto chocolate and blood agar for culture. bacterial species were identified following standard bacteriological procedures. accordingly, a total of 1,556 bacteria were isolated from 960 nasal swabs collected from three different highland areas of ethiopia, namely debre berhan, asella, and gimba. in debre berhan, 140 mannheimia haemolytica, 81 histophilus somni, 57 staphylococcus species, and 52 bibersteinia trehalosi were isolated. while from gimba m. haemolytica, staphylococcus, streptococcus, and h. somni were isolated at rates of 25.2, 15.9, 11.4, and 5.9 %, respectively, of the total 647  bacterial species. in asella from 352 bacterial species isolated, 93 (26.4 %) were m. haemolytica, 48 (13.6 %) were staphylococcus species, 26 (7.4 %) were b.  trehalosi, and 17 (4.8 %) h. somni were recognized. further identification and characterization using biolog identification system enterococcus avium and sphingomonas sanguinis were identified at 100 % probability, while, h. somni and  actinobacillus lignerisii were suggested by the system. the study showed that a variety of bacterial species colonize the nasal cavity of the ethiopian highland  sheep with variable proportion between healthy and pneumonic ones. to our knowledge, this is the first report on isolation of h. somni, an important pathogen in cattle, from the respiratory tract of a ruminant species in the country.
