TI  == [immunological characteristics of the protein antigens of the family neisseriaceae. ii. the importance of an immunochemical analysis of the protein complexes for a study of taxonomy problems].
AB  == the study of antigenic interrelations in the family neisseriaceae resulted in the isolation of 2 main immunologically separated variants of protein complexes: the  first variant was characteristic of nonpathogenic and pathogenic species of the genus neisseria as well as of 7 taxonomically undefined neisseria species (n. lactamicus, n. cuniculi, n. ellongata, n. ovis, n. animalis, n. cinerea, n. canis) and gemella haemolysans; the second variant was represented by the genera  branhamella and acinetobacter. n. caviae and 3 out of 14 neisseria strains of undefined species had no common antigens with the genera neisseria and branhamella. the importance of the immunotyping of protein complexes for studying the problems connected with the taxonomy of the family neisseriaceae was considered.
