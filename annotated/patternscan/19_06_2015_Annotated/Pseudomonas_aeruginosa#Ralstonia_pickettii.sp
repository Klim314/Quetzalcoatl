TI  == non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria in hospital tap water and water used for  haemodialysis and bronchoscope flushing: prevalence and distribution of antibiotic resistant strains.
AB  == this study provides a detailed description of the distribution of non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria (nfgnb) collected in water sources (tap water and water used for haemodialysis and bronchoscope flushing) from different  wards of a tertiary care hospital. the aim is to identify risk practices for patients or to alert clinicians to the possible contamination of environment and  medical devices. the resistance profile of nfgnb environmental isolates has shown that more than half (55.56%) of the strains isolated were resistant to one or more antibiotics tested in different antimicrobial categories. in particular, 38.89% of these strains were multidrug resistant (mdr) and 16.67% were extensively drug resistant (xdr). the most prevalent bacterial species recovered  in water samples were pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, ralstonia  pickettii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. analysis of antibiotic resistance rates has shown remarkable differences between pseudomonadaceae (p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens) and emerging pathogens, such as s. maltophilia and r. pickettii. multidrug resistance can be relatively common among nosocomial isolates of p. aeruginosa, which represent the large majority of clinical isolates; moreover, our findings highlight that the emergent antibiotic resistant opportunistic pathogens, such as r. pickettii and s. maltophilia, isolated from hospital environments could be potentially more dangerous than other more known waterborne pathogens, if not subjected to surveillance to direct the decontamination procedures.

TI  == emergence of unusual nonfermenting gram-negative nosocomial pathogens in a saudi  hospital.
AB  == this study aimed to determine the frequency of isolation and prevalence of drug resistance in nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb) other than pseudomonas  aeruginosa and predisposing factors for the acquisition of nosocomial infections  caused by these emerging pathogens in a saudi tertiary care hospital. a total of  125 nonduplicating nfgnb nosocomial strains were isolated, of these, 68 (54.4%) were acinetobacter baumannii, 26 (20.8%) stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 14 (11.2%) alcaligenes faecalis, 12 (9.6%) chryseobacterium indologenes, and 5 (4%) ralstonia pickettii. mics of 11 antibiotics were determined using the reference broth microdilution method. with the exception of colistin that inhibited 100% of a. baumannii isolates, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole that inhibited 100% of s. maltophilia isolates, and carbapenems that inhibited 100% of a. faecalis isolates, none of the tested antimicrobial agents inhibited 100% of the other nfgnb spp. our results emphasize that clinicians and microbiologists should consider a. faecalis, c. indologenes, and r. pickettii as emerging nosocomial pathogens. in addition, local resistance data are essential for helping physicians in deciding an appropriate antibiotic for empirical therapy of infections with these emerging and unusual nfgnb.

TI  == detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamase in pseudomonas spp. isolated from two tertiary care hospitals in bangladesh.
AB  == background: extended spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls) represent a major group of lactamases responsible for resistance, mostly produced by gram-negative bacteria, to newer generations of ss-lactam drugs currently being identified in large numbers worldwide. the present study was undertaken to see the frequency of esbl  producing pseudomonas spp. isolated from six hundred clinical specimens (wound, pus, aural, urine, sputum, throat and other swabs) collected over a period of three years from two tertiary care hospitals in bangladesh. findings: aerobic bacterial culture was performed on aseptically collected swabs and only growth of pseudomonas was considered for further species identification and esbl production along with serotyping of pseudomonas aeruginosa. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using the kirby-bauer agar diffusion method and esbl production was detected on mueller hinton agar by double-disk synergy technique using amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam. culture yielded 120 pseudomonas spp. and 82 of them were biochemically characterized for species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be the predominant (90.2%) species. of 82 isolates tested for esbl, 31 (37.8%) were esbl positive with 29 (93.5%) as pseudomonas aeruginosa, the remaining 2 (6.5%) were stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ralstonia pickettii. antibiogram revealed imipenem as the most effective drug (93.3%) among all antimicrobials used against pseudomonas spp. followed by aminoglycosides (63.7%). conclusion: esbl producing  pseudomonas spp. was found to be a frequent isolate from two tertiary care hospitals in bangladesh, showing limited susceptibility to antimicrobials and decreased susceptibility to imipenem in particular, which is a matter of great concern.

TI  == intraclonal diversity of the pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis airway isolates tbcf10839 and tbcf121838: distinct signatures of transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, adherence and pathogenicity despite an almost identical genome sequence.
AB  == microevolution of closely related pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared in the clone tb strains tbcf10839 and tbcf121838 which had been isolated from two unrelated individuals with cystic fibrosis who had acquired clone tb during a local outbreak. compared with the strain pao1 reference sequence the two clone tb genomes shared 23 155 nucleotide exchanges, 32 out-of-frame indels in the coding  region and another repertoire of replacement and genomic islands such as pagi-1,  pagi-2, pagi-5, lesgi-1 and les-prophage 4. only tbcf121838 carried a genomic island known from ralstonia pickettii. six of the seven strain-specific sequence  variations in the core genome were detected in genes affecting motility, biofilm  formation or virulence, i.e. non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in mexs, pa3729, pa5017, mifr, a frameshift mutation in pilf (tbcf121838) and an intragenic deletion in pilq (tbcf10839). despite their almost identical genome sequence the two strains differed strongly from each other in transcriptome and metabolome profiles, mucin adherence and phagocytosis assays. tbcf121838 was susceptible to killing by neutrophils, but tbcf10839 could grow in leucocytes. microevolution in p. aeruginosa apparently can generate novel complex traits by few or even single mutations provided that predisposing mutational events had occurred before in the clonal lineage.

TI  == display of functionally active phb depolymerase on escherichia coli cell surface.
AB  == the display of phb depolymerase (phaz(rpit1) ) from r. pickettii t1 on the surface of e. coli jm109 cells is realized using opri of p. aeruginosa as the anchoring motif. the fusion protein is stably expressed and its surface localization is verified by immunofluorescence microscopy. the displayed phaz(rpit1) retains its cleaving ability for soluble substrates as well as its ability to adsorb to the phb surface, and also remains catalycically active in the degradation of insoluble polyester materials, in spite of the possible suppression of the enzyme movement on the polymer surface. the results demonstrate that phaz(rpit1) -displaying e. coli shows potential for use as a whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of (r)-3-hydroxybutyrate monomers from  insoluble phb materials.

TI  == [comparison between agar dilution and three other methods for determining the susceptibility of 228 clinical isolates of non-fermenting gram-negative rods].
AB  == introduction: susceptibility testing for non-fermenting gram-negative rods (nfgnr) is problematic; valid methods are needed for this purpose. methods: in this study, 228 nfgnr clinical isolates were evaluated, including 85 acinetobacter spp., 80 stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 50 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 13 other species (8 ralstonia pickettii and 5 burkholderia cepacia). agar dilution was used as the reference method, and results were compared with those obtained by disk diffusion, etest, and microdilution performed with the vitek 2 compact system. results: the disk method was unacceptable for s. maltophilia and  p. aeruginosa, in the latter organism, mainly because of poor agreement in the colistin results. nonetheless, the disk method is valid for acinetobacter spp. and the remaining nfgnrs. the vitek 2 compact system yielded poor results for piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, and ceftazidime in s. maltophilia. there were minor discrepancies with the vitek 2 compact system and the etest for tigecycline in acineobacter spp. and s. maltophilia, likely because of the differing composition of the muller-hinton agar lots. hence, etest results should be interpreted with caution. conclusion: the disk diffusion method is inadequated for s. maltophilia. this method is unacceptable for testing colistin in p. aeruginosa. the methods vitek 2 compact system and etest show minor discrepancies for testing s. maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. for tigecycline.

TI  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry for  identification of nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli isolated from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == the identification of nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli isolated from cystic fibrosis (cf) patients is usually achieved by using phenotype-based techniques and eventually molecular tools. these techniques remain time-consuming, expensive, and technically demanding. we used a method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) for the identification of these bacteria. a set of reference strains belonging to 58  species of clinically relevant nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli was used. to identify peaks discriminating between these various species, the profile of 10 isolated colonies obtained from 10 different passages was analyzed for each referenced strain. conserved peaks with a relative intensity greater than 0.1 were retained. the spectra of 559 clinical isolates were then compared to that of each of the 58 reference strains as follows: 400 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 54 achromobacter xylosoxidans, 32 stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 52 burkholderia cepacia complex (bcc), 1 burkholderia gladioli, 14 ralstonia mannitolilytica, 2 ralstonia pickettii, 1 bordetella hinzii, 1 inquilinus limosus, 1 cupriavidus respiraculi, and 1 burkholderia thailandensis. using this database, 549 strains were correctly identified. nine bcc strains and one r. mannnitolilytica strain were identified as belonging to the appropriate genus but not the correct species. we subsequently engineered bcc- and ralstonia-specific databases using additional reference strains. using these databases, correct identification for these species increased from 83 to 98% and from 94 to 100% of cases, respectively. altogether, these data demonstrate that, in cf patients, maldi-tof-ms is a powerful tool for rapid identification of nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for rapid identification of nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria isolated from sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == the accurate and rapid identification of bacteria isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) is critical in epidemiological studies, during intrahospital outbreaks, for patient treatment, and for determination of therapeutic options. while the most common organisms isolated from sputum samples are pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus influenzae, in recent decades an increasing fraction of cf patients has been colonized by other nonfermenting (nf) gram-negative rods, such as burkholderia cepacia complex (bcc) bacteria, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, ralstonia pickettii, acinetobacter spp., and achromobacter spp. in the present study, we developed a novel strategy for the rapid identification of nf rods based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) in combination with artificial neural networks (anns). a total of 15 reference strains and 169 clinical isolates of nf gram-negative bacteria recovered from sputum samples from 150 cf patients were used in this study. the clinical isolates were identified according to the guidelines for clinical microbiology practices for respiratory tract specimens from cf patients; and particularly, bcc bacteria were further identified by reca-based pcr followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with haeiii, and their identities were confirmed by reca species-specific pcr. in addition, some strains belonging to genera different from bcc were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. a standardized experimental protocol was established, and an ftir spectral database containing more than 2,000 infrared spectra was created. the ann identification system consisted of two hierarchical levels. the top-level network allowed the identification of p. aeruginosa, s. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxidans, acinetobacter spp., r. pickettii, and bcc bacteria with an identification success rate of 98.1%. the second-level network was developed to differentiate the four most clinically relevant species of bcc, b. cepacia, b. multivorans, b. cenocepacia, and b. stabilis (genomovars i to iv, respectively), with a correct identification rate of 93.8%. our results demonstrate the high degree of reliability and strong potential of ann-based ftir spectrum analysis for the rapid identification of nf  rods suitable for use in routine clinical microbiology laboratories.

TI  == secretion pathway for the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase in ralstonia pickettii t1.
AB  == the extracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase from ralstonia pickettii t1 has been purified, its function and character investigated in detail, and its  gene cloned and sequenced. however, the mechanism by which this enzyme is secreted has not been elucidated. a mutant unable to degrade poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), n17, was obtained with the random insertion of a mini-transposon, tn5. western analysis using antiserum against the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase of ralstonia pickettii t1, revealed that n17 accumulated the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase in the periplasm and cytoplasm, and did not secrete the enzyme into the external medium. it was also found that 3-hydroxybutyrate-oligomer hydrolase was secreted but inactive. the disrupted gene in n17, depo, was analyzed by southern hybridization and its nucleotide sequence was determined. one complete open reading frame was found in  the cloned 2.3-kbp dna fragment. from a blast search, this gene product was found to be homologous to pulo of ralstonia eutropha jmp134 (60% identity) and xcpa of  pseudomonas aeruginosa (60% identity). these proteins are prepilin peptidase/n-metyltransferases, a component of the type ii secretion pathway. depo also had the four cysteines highly conserved in most prepilin peptidases at the same positions. the transcript of depo was examined by northern hybridization using depo as a probe. in the total rna of ralstonia pickettii t1 in the early stationary phase, a band at 2.6-kb was detected, suggesting depo to be a functional gene. in this study, it was found that poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase was secreted by the type ii pathway.

TI  == evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting gram-negative rods.
AB  == to evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (pyr) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (nfgnr), 293 isolates were tested. a 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. from this a 108-109 cfu/ml suspension was added to 0.25 ml of sterile physiologic solution. a pyr disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at  35-37 degrees c, at environmental atmosphere. reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. strains of acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter haemolyticus, alcaligenes faecalis, bergeyella zoohelcum, bordetella bronchiseptica, bordetella hinzii, brevundimonas diminuta, brevundimonas vesicularis, brucella ovis, brucella spp., brucella suis, burkholderia cepacia complex, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella lacunata, moraxella nonliquefaciens, moraxella osloensis, oligella ureolytica, pseudomonas alcaligenes, pseudomonas mendocina, pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas vb3, psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were pyr negative. on the other hand achromobacter piechaudii, achromobacter denitrificans, achromobacter xylosoxidans, burkholderia gladioli, chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, comamonas testosroni, cupriavidus pauculus, delftia acidovorans, elizabethkingia meningoseptica, myroides spp., ochrobactrum  anthropi, pseudomonas oryzihabitans, ralstonia pickettii, rhizobium radiobacter,  shewanella spp., sphingobacterium multivorum, sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and  weeksella virosa were pyr positive. finally, acinetobacter lwoffii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, roseomonas spp., and sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were pyr variable. pyr testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of nfgnr.

TI  == toluene 3-monooxygenase of ralstonia pickettii pko1 is a para-hydroxylating enzyme.
AB  == oxygenases are promising biocatalysts for performing selective hydroxylations not accessible by chemical methods. whereas toluene 4-monooxygenase (t4mo) of pseudomonas mendocina kr1 hydroxylates monosubstituted benzenes at the para position and toluene ortho-monooxygenase (tom) of burkholderia cepacia g4 hydroxylates at the ortho position, toluene 3-monooxygenase (t3mo) of ralstonia pickettii pko1 was reported previously to hydroxylate toluene at the meta position, producing primarily m-cresol (r. h. olsen, j. j. kukor, and b. kaphammer, j. bacteriol. 176:3749-3756, 1994). using gas chromatography, we have  discovered that t3mo hydroxylates monosubstituted benzenes predominantly at the para position. tg1/pbs(kan)t3mo cells expressing t3mo oxidized toluene at a maximal rate of 11.5 +/- 0.33 nmol/min/mg of protein with an apparent km value of 250 microm and produced 90% p-cresol and 10% m-cresol. this product mixture was successively transformed to 4-methylcatechol. t4mo, in comparison, produces 97% p-cresol and 3% m-cresol. pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 harboring pro1966 (the original t3mo-bearing plasmid) also exhibited the same product distribution as that of tg1/pbs(kan)t3mo. tg1/pbs(kan)t3mo produced 66% p-nitrophenol and 34% m-nitrophenol from nitrobenzene and 100% p-methoxyphenol from methoxybenzene, as  well as 62% 1-naphthol and 38% 2-naphthol from naphthalene; similar results were  found with tg1/pbs(kan)t4mo. sequencing of the tbu locus from pbs(kan)t3mo and pro1966 revealed complete identity between the two, thus eliminating any possible cloning errors. 1h nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed the structural identity of p-cresol in samples containing the product of hydroxylation of toluene by pbs(kan)t3mo.

TI  == development of rrna-based pcr assays for identification of burkholderia cepacia complex isolates recovered from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == pcr assays targeting rrna genes were developed to identify species (genomovars) within the burkholderia cepacia complex. each assay was tested with 177 bacterial isolates that also underwent taxonomic analysis by whole-cell protein profile. these isolates were from clinical and environmental sources and included 107 b. cepacia complex strains, 23 burkholderia gladioli strains, 20 ralstonia pickettii strains, 10 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 8 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, and 9 isolates belonging to nine other species. the sensitivity and specificity of the 16s rrna-based assay for burkholderia multivorans (genomovar ii) were 100 and 99%, respectively; for burkholderia vietnamiensis (genomovar v), sensitivity and specificity were 87 and 92%, respectively. an assay based on 16s  and 23s rrna gene analysis of b. cepacia atcc 25416 (genomovar i) was useful in identifying genomovars i, iii, and iv as a group (sensitivity, 100%, and specificity, 99%). another assay, designed to be specific at the genus level, identified all but one of the burkholderia and ralstonia isolates tested (sensitivity, 99%, and specificity, 96%). the combined use of these assays offers a significant improvement over previously published pcr assays for b. cepacia.

TI  == identification of burkholderia spp. in the clinical microbiology laboratory: comparison of conventional and molecular methods.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) predisposes patients to bacterial colonization and infection of the lower airways. several species belonging to the genus burkholderia are potential cf-related pathogens, but microbiological identification may be complicated. this situation is not in the least due to the poorly defined taxonomic status of these bacteria, and further validation of the available diagnostic assays is required. a total of 114 geographically diverse bacterial isolates, previously identified in reference laboratories as burkholderia cepacia (n = 51), b. gladioli (n = 14), ralstonia pickettii (n = 6), b. multivorans (n =  2), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 3), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), were collected from environmental, clinical, and reference sources. in addition,  27 clinical isolates putatively identified as burkholderia spp. were recovered from the sputum of dutch cf patients. all isolates were used to evaluate the accuracy of two selective growth media, four systems for biochemical identification (api 20ne, vitek gni, vitek nfc, and microscan), and three different pcr-based assays. the pcr assays amplify different parts of the ribosomal dna operon, either alone or in combination with cleavage by various restriction enzymes (pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism [rflp] analysis). the best system for the biochemical identification of b. cepacia appeared to be the api 20ne test. none of the biochemical assays successfully grouped the b. gladioli strains. the pcr-rflp method appeared to be the optimal method for accurate nucleic acid-mediated identification of the different burkholderia spp. with this method, b. gladioli was also reliably classified in a separate group. for the laboratory diagnosis of b. cepacia, we recommend parallel cultures on blood agar medium and selective agar plates. further identification of colonies with a burkholderia phenotype should be performed with the api 20ne test. for final confirmation of species identities, pcr amplification of the small-subunit rrna gene followed by rflp analysis with various enzymes is recommended.
