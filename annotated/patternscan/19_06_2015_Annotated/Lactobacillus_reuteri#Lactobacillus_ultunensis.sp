TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and  bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l.  reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a  strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.

TI  == lactobacillus gastricus sp. nov., lactobacillus antri sp. nov., lactobacillus kalixensis sp. nov. and lactobacillus ultunensis sp. nov., isolated from human stomach mucosa.
AB  == in an attempt to study the composition of the lactobacillus flora from mucosa of  human stomach, 16s rrna gene sequences of 129 isolates were analysed. for 15 of these, the results differed significantly from known sequences, and additional tests were performed to determine whether these isolates represented as yet unrecognized species. phenotypic and genetic characteristics revealed that these  isolates represented four novel lactobacillus species. two belong to the lactobacillus reuteri and the other two to the lactobacillus delbrueckii subgroup of lactobacillus. the names lactobacillus gastricus sp. nov., lactobacillus antri sp. nov., lactobacillus kalixensis sp. nov. and lactobacillus ultunensis sp. nov. are proposed, with the respective type strains kx156a7t (=lmg 22113t=dsm 16045t=ccug 48454t), kx146a4t (=lmg 22111t=dsm 16041t=ccug 48456t), kx127a2t (=lmg 22115t=dsm 16043t=ccug 48459t) and kx146c1t (=lmg 22117t=dsm 16047t=ccug 48460t).
