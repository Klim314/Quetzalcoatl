TI  == clostridium hiranonis sp. nov., a human intestinal bacterium with bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity.
AB  == the clostridium-like organisms to-931t and hd-17, isolated from human faeces, have high levels of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity. sequencing of their 16s rdna demonstrated that they belong to cluster xi of the genus clostridium and that they represent a new and distinct line of descent. clostridium bifermentans and clostridium sordellii in cluster xi also possess bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity. dna-dna hybridization experiments with the isolates, to-931t and hd-17, and c bifermentans and c. sordellii revealed that the isolates are a single species distinct from c. bifermentans and c sordellii. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis, using 16s rdna sequences, and dna-dna hybridization analysis, it is concluded that strains to-931t and hd-17 are members of a new species of the genus clostridium, for which the name clostridium hiranonis is proposed. the type strain is strain to-931t (= jcm 10541t = dsm 13275t).
