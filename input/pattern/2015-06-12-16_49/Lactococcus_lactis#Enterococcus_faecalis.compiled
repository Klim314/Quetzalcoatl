TI  - The conserved modular elements of the acyl carrier proteins of lipid synthesis are only partially interchangeable.
AB  - Prior work showed that expression of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of a diverse set of bacteria replaced the function of Escherichia coli ACP in lipid biosynthesis. However, the AcpAs of Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis were inactive. Both failed to support growth of an E. coli acpP mutant strain. This defect seemed likely because of the helix II sequences of the two AcpAs, which differed markedly from those of the proteins that supported growth. To test this premise, chimeric ACPs were constructed in which L. lactis helix II replaced helix II of E. coli AcpP and vice versa. Expression of the AcpP protein L. lactis AcpA helix II allowed weak growth, whereas the L. lactis AcpA-derived protein that contained E. coli AcpP helix II failed to support growth of the E. coli mutant strain. Replacement of the L. lactis AcpA helix II residues in this protein showed that substitution of valine for the phenylalanine residue four residues downstream of the phosphopanthetheine-modified serine gave robust growth and allowed modification by the endogenous AcpS phosphopantetheinyl transferase (rather than the promiscuous Sfp transferase required to modify the L. lactis AcpA and the chimera of L. lactis AcpA helix II in AcpP). Further chimera constructs showed that the lack of function of the L. lactis AcpA-derived protein containing E. coli AcpP helix II was due to incompatibility of L. lactis AcpA helix I with the downstream elements of AcpP. Therefore, the origins of ACP incompatibility can reside in either helix I or in helix II.
TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - The length of a lantibiotic hinge region has profound influence on antimicrobial  activity and host specificity.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized (methyl)lanthionine containing peptides  which can efficiently inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. As lantibiotics kill bacteria efficiently and resistance to them is difficult to be obtained, they have the potential to be used in many applications, e.g., in pharmaceutical industry or food industry. Nisin can inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria by binding to lipid II and by making pores in their membrane. The C-terminal part of nisin is known to play an important role during translocation over the membrane and forming pore complexes. However, as the thickness of bacterial membranes varies between different species and environmental conditions, this property could have an influence on the pore forming activity of nisin. To investigate this, the so-called "hinge region" of nisin (residues NMK) was engineered to vary from one to six amino acid residues and specific activity against different indicators was compared. Antimicrobial activity in liquid culture assays showed that wild type nisin is most active, while truncation of the hinge region dramatically reduced the activity of the peptide. However, one or two amino acids extensions showed only slightly reduced activity against most indicator strains. Notably, some variants (+2, +1, -1, -2) exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than nisin in agar well diffusion assays against Lactococcus lactis MG1363, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis VE14089, Bacillus sporothermodurans IC4 and Bacillus cereus 4153 at certain temperatures.
TI  - Enhanced free fatty acid production by codon-optimized Lactococcus lactis acyl-ACP thioesterase gene expression in Escherichia coli using crude glycerol.
AB  - Fatty acid production and composition are determined by the type of acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases (acyl-ACP TEs) expressed in Escherichia coli. Bacterial acyl-ACP TEs from Lactococcus lactis (SGJS47), Enterococcus faecalis (SGJS49), and Burkholderia cepacia (SGJS50) were codon-optimized and expressed in E. coli for enhanced fatty acid production. Samples were extracted at the lag, log, and stationary phases of cell growth, and gene expression levels of the codon optimized acy-ACP TEs as well as fatty acid production were monitored. At 24h after initiation of gene expression, the OPLlTE expression level and fatty acid production in SGJS47 increased up to 15.8-fold and 3.2-fold compared to the control and other recombinant strains, respectively. Additionally, in SGJS47, improvement in free fatty acid (FFA) composition, high-specificity production of short-chain fatty acids (C8, C10) and unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1) was achieved in crude glycerol medium condition. Compared with control strain, the percentage of FFAs (C8 and C10) was enhanced by approximately 16- to 21-fold, C16:1 FFA ratio increased approximately 18-fold. Observation of codon-optimized acyl-ACP TE genes expression level in E. coli may be useful for understanding mechanisms towards improving fatty acid production. Engineered strains have the potential to overproduce specific FFAs and thereby reduce the cost of fatty acid production by using industrially inexpensive carbon sources.
TI  - Use of selected lactic acid bacteria in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is among the major pathogenic bacteria that cause chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is related to the development of gastric cancer. Several chemicals, including antibiotics, have been used to eradicate H. pylori; however, they do not always curb the infection. Ten representative type strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were screened for antagonism toward H. pylori via inhibition of urease activity. Strains inhibiting the binding of H. pylori to human gastric cell line cells and suppressing H. pylori-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) production were also screened. Of these, Pediococcus pentosaseus (SL4), which inhibited the adhesion of H. pylori to MKN-45 gastric cancer cells, Bifidobacterium longum (BG7), with urease inhibiting activity, and Lactococcus lactis (SL3), and Enterococcus faecalis (SL5), which suppressed H. pylori-induced IL-8 production within MKN-45 and AGS cells, were selected. In mouse model, these LAB stains in combination significantly suppressed IL-8 levels in serum. Gastric pH also recovered to normal values after the administration of these LAB. These stains effectively suppressed H. pylori viability, although not to the extent of antibiotic treatment. When used as probiotics, LAB may help decrease the occurrence of gastritis and reduce the risk of H. pylori infection without, inducing side effects.
TI  - Control of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh cheese using protective lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In the past years, there has been a particular focus on the application of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in controlling the growth of pathogenic bacteria in foods. The aim of this study was to select LAB strains with antimicrobial activity, previously isolated from a traditional Azorean artisanal cheese (Pico cheese), in order to identify those with the greatest potential in reducing Listeria monocytogenes in fresh cheese. Eight bacteriocin producer strains identified as Lactococcus lactis (1) and Enterococcus faecalis (7) were tested. In general, the bacteriocin-producing strains presented a moderate growth in fresh cheese at refrigeration temperatures (4 degrees C), increasing one log count in three days. They exhibited slow acidification capacity, despite the increased production of lactic acid displayed by some strains after 24h. Bacteriocin activity was only detected in the whey of fresh cheese inoculated with two Enterococcus strains, but all cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing strains inhibited L. monocytogenes growth in the agar diffusion bioassay. No significant differences were found in overall sensory evaluation made by a non-trained panel of 50-52 tasters using the isolates as adjunct culture in fresh cheese, with the exception of one Enterococcus strain. To test the effect of in situ bacteriocin production against L. monocytogenes, fresh cheese was made from pasteurized cows' milk inoculated with bacteriocin-producing LAB and artificially contaminated with approximately 10(6) CFU/mL of L. monocytogenes. The numbers of L. monocytogenes were monitored during storage of fresh cheese at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees C) for up to 15 days. All strains controlled the growth of L. monocytogenes, although some Enterococcus were more effective in reducing the pathogen counts. After 7 days, this reduction was of approximately 4 log units compared to the positive control. In comparison, an increase of 4 log CFU/mL in pathogen numbers was detected over the same period, in the absence of bacteriocin-producing LAB. The combination of two bacteriocin producing Enterococcus sp. optimized the reduction of L. monocytogenes counts in fresh cheese, reducing by approximately 5 log units after 7 days. The present work demonstrates that using bacteriocin-producing strains in the manufacture of fresh cheese might contribute to preventing the growth of undesirable pathogenic bacteria such as L. monocytogenes. A blend of two strains demonstrated great potential as a protective culture for the cheese making process.
TI  - Control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain Enterococcus faecalis EF37 and the histamine producing strain Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). The results showed that the three L. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 and EG46 produced, respectively, nisin Z and lacticin 481, while for the strains CG27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. The co-culture of E. faecalis EF37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of E. faecalis. Tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when E. faecalis EF37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. All the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with E. faecalis EF37; in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 induced the death of S. thermophilus PRI60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). The other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against S. thermophilus PRI60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if L. lactis subsp. lactis EG46 was less effective when the initial streptococci concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. This preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate BA and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on BA production on the same strain. This knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.
TI  - Microbiota characterization of a Belgian protected designation of origin cheese,  Herve cheese, using metagenomic analysis.
AB  - Herve cheese is a Belgian soft cheese with a washed rind, and is made from raw or pasteurized milk. The specific microbiota of this cheese has never previously been fully explored and the use of raw or pasteurized milk in addition to starters is assumed to affect the microbiota of the rind and the heart. The aim of the study was to analyze the bacterial microbiota of Herve cheese using classical microbiology and a metagenomic approach based on 16S ribosomal DNA pyrosequencing. Using classical microbiology, the total counts of bacteria were comparable for the 11 samples of tested raw and pasteurized milk cheeses, reaching almost 8 log cfu/g. Using the metagenomic approach, 207 different phylotypes were identified. The rind of both the raw and pasteurized milk cheeses was found to be highly diversified. However, 96.3 and 97.9% of the total microbiota of the raw milk and pasteurized cheese rind, respectively, were composed of species present in both types of cheese, such as Corynebacterium casei, Psychrobacter spp., Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, Staphylococcus equorum, Vagococcus salmoninarum, and other species present at levels below 5%. Brevibacterium linens were present at low levels (0.5 and 1.6%, respectively) on the rind of both the raw and the pasteurized milk cheeses, even though this bacterium had been inoculated during the manufacturing process. Interestingly, Psychroflexus casei, also described as giving a red smear to Raclette-type cheese, was identified in small proportions in the composition of the rind of both the raw and pasteurized milk cheeses (0.17 and 0.5%, respectively). In the heart of the cheeses, the common species of bacteria reached more than 99%. The main species identified were Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, Psychrobacter spp., and Staphylococcus equorum ssp. equorum. Interestingly, 93 phylotypes were present only in the raw milk cheeses and 29 only in the pasteurized milk cheeses, showing the high diversity of the microbiota. Corynebacterium casei and Enterococcus faecalis were more prevalent in the raw milk cheeses, whereas Psychrobacter celer was present in the pasteurized milk cheeses. However, this specific microbiota represented a low proportion of the cheese microbiota. This study demonstrated that Herve cheese microbiota is rich and that pasteurized milk cheeses are microbiologically very close to raw milk cheeses, probably due to the similar manufacturing process. The characterization of the microbiota of this particular protected designation of origin cheese was useful in enabling us to gain a better knowledge of the bacteria responsible for the character of this cheese.
TI  - Modified lactic acid bacteria detect and inhibit multiresistant enterococci.
AB  - We designed Lactococcus lactis to detect Enterococcus faecalis. Upon detection, L. lactis produce and secrete antienterococcal peptides. The peptides inhibit enterococcal growth and reduce viability of enterococci in the vicinity of L. lactis. The enterococcal sex pheromone cCF10 serves as the signal for detection. Expression vectors derived from pCF10, a cCF10-responsive E. faecalis sex-pheromone conjugative plasmid, were engineered in L. lactis for the detection system. Recombinant host strains were engineered to express genes for three bacteriocins, enterocin A, hiracin JM79 and enterocin P, each with potent antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis. Sensitive detection and specific inhibition occur both in agar and liquid media. The engineered L. lactis also inhibited growth of multidrug-resistant E. faecium strains, when induced by cCF10. The presented vectors and strains can be components of a toolbox for the development of alternative antibiotic technologies targeting enterococci at the site of infection.
TI  - The elongation of ovococci.
AB  - The morphogenesis of ovococci has been reviewed extensively. Recent results have  provided new insights concerning the mechanisms of elongation in ovoid bacteria. We present here the proteins involved in the elongation (firmly established and more or less hypothetical) and discuss the relationship between elongation and division of ovococci.
TI  - Analysis of the promoters involved in enterocin AS-48 expression.
AB  - The enterocin AS-48 is the best characterized antibacterial circular protein in prokaryotes. It is a hydrophobic and cationic bacteriocin, which is ribosomally synthesized by enterococcal cells and post-translationally cyclized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. The production of and immunity towards AS-48 depend upon the coordinated expression of ten genes organized in two operons, as-48ABC (where genes encoding enzymes with processing, secretion, and immunity functions are adjacent to the structural as-48A gene) and as-48C1DD1EFGH. The current study describes the identification of the promoters involved in AS-48 expression. Seven putative promoters have been here amplified, and separately inserted into the promoter-probe vector pTLR1, to create transcriptional fusions with the mCherry gene used as a reporter. The activity of these promoter regions was assessed measuring the expression of the fluorescent mCherry protein using the constitutive pneumococcal promoter PX as a reference. Our results revealed that only three promoters PA, P2(2) and PD1 were recognized in Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli, in the conditions tested. The maximal fluorescence was obtained with PX in all the strains, followed by the P2(2) promoter, which level of fluorescence was 2-fold compared to PA and 4-fold compared to PD1. Analysis of putative factors influencing the promoter activity in single and double transformants in E. faecalis JH2-2 demonstrated that, in general, a better expression was achieved in presence of pAM401-81. In addition, the P2(2) promoter could be regulated in a negative fashion by genes existing in the native pMB-2 plasmid other than those of the as-48 cluster, while the pH seems to affect differently the as-48 promoter expression.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fresh coffee cherries in Taiwan.
AB  - A total of 102 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from three different coffee farms in Taiwan. These isolates were classified and identified by the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Heterofermentative Leuconostoc, and Weissella species were the most common LAB found in two farms located at an approximate altitude of 800 m. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the most common LAB found in the remaining farm was located at an approximate altitude of 1,200 m. It is therefore suggested that the altitude and climate may affect the distribution of LAB. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, two strains included in the genera Enterococcus were considered as two potential novel species or subspecies. In addition, a total of 34 isolates showed the antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus. Moreover, seven Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains and one Enterococcus faecalis strain were found to have bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance-producing capability. These results suggest that various LAB are associated with fresh coffee cherries in Taiwan. Some of the isolates found in this study showed potential as antifungal agents.
TI  - PrgK, a multidomain peptidoglycan hydrolase, is essential for conjugative transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pCF10.
AB  - Peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases associated with bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are thought to generate localized lesions in the PG layer to facilitate assembly of the translocation channel. The pheromone-responsive plasmid pCF10 of Enterococcus faecalis encodes a putative cell wall hydrolase, PrgK, and here we report that a prgK deletion abolished functionality of the pCF10-encoded T4SS as monitored by pCF10 conjugative transfer. Expression in trans of wild-type prgK fully complemented this mutation. PrgK has three potential hydrolase motifs resembling staphylococcal LytM, soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT), and cysteine-, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) domains. Complementation analyses with mutant alleles established that PrgK bearing two hydrolase domains in any combination supported near-wild-type plasmid transfer, and PrgK bearing a single hydrolase domain supported at least a low level of transfer in filter matings. When exported to the Escherichia coli periplasm, each domain disrupted cell growth, and combinations of domains additionally induced cell rounding and blebbing and conferred enhanced sensitivity to osmotic shock. Each domain bound PG in vitro, but only the SLT domain exhibited detectable hydrolase activity, as shown by zymographic analyses and release of fluorescent PG fragments. Genes encoding three T4SS-associated, putative hydrolases, Lactococcus lactis CsiA, Tn925 Orf14, and pIP501 TraG, partially complemented the DeltaprgK mutation. Our findings establish that PrgK is an essential component of the pCF10-encoded Prg/Pcf T4SS and that its hydrolase domains coordinate their activities for full PrgK function. PrgK is indispensable for plasmid transfer in liquid matings, suggestive of a role in formation or stabilization of mating junctions.
TI  - Technological properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from Pico cheese an artisanal cow's milk cheese.
AB  - AIM: Evaluate technologically relevant properties from bacteriocin-producing strains to use as starter/adjunct cultures in cheese making. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight isolates obtained from Pico cheese produced in Azores (Portugal) were found to produce bacteriocins against Listeria monocytogenes and three isolates against Clostridium perfringens. They were identified as Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis and submitted to technological tests: growth at different conditions of temperature and salt, acid production, proteolysis, lipolysis, coexistence, enzymatic profile and autolytic capacity. Safety evaluation was performed by evaluating haemolytic, gelatinase and DNase activity, resistance to antibiotics and the presence of virulence genes. Some isolates presented good technological features such as high autolytic activity, acid and diacetyl production. Lactococcus lactis was negative for all virulence genes tested and inhibit the growth of all Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates. Enterococci were positive for the presence of some virulence genes, but none of the isolates were classified as resistant to important antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriocin-producing Lc. lactis present good potential for application in food as adjunct culture in cheese production. The study also reveals good technological features for some Enterococcus isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriocin-producing strains presented important technological properties to be exploited as new adjunct culture for the dairy industry, influencing flavour development and improve safety.
TI  - A Zn-dependent metallopeptidase is responsible for sensitivity to LsbB, a class II leaderless bacteriocin of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis BGMN1-5.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis BGMN1-5 produces a leaderless class II bacteriocin called LsbB. To identify the receptor for LsbB, a cosmid library of the LsbB-sensitive strain BGMN1-596 was constructed. About 150 cosmid clones were individually isolated and transferred to LsbB-resistant mutants of BGMN1-596. Cosmid pAZILcos/MN2, carrying a 40-kb insert, was found to restore LsbB sensitivity in LsbB-resistant mutants. Further subcloning revealed that a 1.9-kb fragment, containing only one open reading frame, was sufficient to restore sensitivity. The fragment contains the gene yvjB coding for a Zn-dependent membrane-bound metallopeptidase, suggesting that this gene may serve as the receptor for LsbB. Further support for this notion derives from several independent experiments: (i) whole-genome sequencing confirmed that all LsbB-resistant mutants contain mutations in yvjB; (ii) disruption of yvjB by direct gene knockout rendered sensitive strains BGMN1-596 and IL1403 resistant to LsbB; and (iii) most compellingly, heterologous expression of yvjB in naturally resistant strains of other species, such as Lactobacillus paracasei and Enterococcus faecalis, also rendered them sensitive to the bacteriocin. To our knowledge, this is the first time a membrane-bound peptidase gene has been shown to be involved in bacteriocin sensitivity in target cells. We also demonstrated a novel successful approach for identifying bacteriocin receptors.
TI  - Development of a selective and differential medium for capsulated Lactococcus garvieae.
AB  - A selective and differential medium termed 'LG agar' was developed for the isolation and presumptive identification of Lactococcus garvieae that results in black colonies with red halos. In this study, all 14 strains of L. garvieae and only 9 of the 148 strains representing 38 other species were able to grow on the LG agar. The nine viable strains on LG agar plates (including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio furnissii, Vibrio mimicus and Vibrio salmonicida) were further differentiated from L. garvieae by various colours or colony features. Colonies isolated from the mixing culture and the infected giant sea perch using LG agar plates were all positively identified as L. garvieae by conventional tests and 16S rDNA sequencing. Furthermore, LG agar discriminated capsulated strains of L. garvieae, which were believed to be correlated with pathogens of fish and shellfish, from non-capsulated ones by colony appearances. The specificity and differentiating ability of LG agar suggest that this medium displays considerable potential for primary isolation and presumptive identification of L. garvieae from pathological and environmental samples.
TI  - Functional diversity of tandem substrate-binding domains in ABC transporters from pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter GlnPQ is an essential uptake system for amino acids in gram-positive pathogens and related nonpathogenic bacteria. The transporter has tandem substrate-binding domains (SBDs) fused to each transmembrane domain, giving rise to four SBDs per functional transporter complex. We have determined the crystal structures and ligand-binding properties of the SBDs of GlnPQ from Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Lactococcus lactis. The tandem SBDs differ in substrate specificity and affinity, allowing cells to efficiently accumulate different amino acids via a single ABC transporter. The combined structural, functional, and thermodynamic analysis revealed the roles of individual residues in determining the substrate affinity. We succeeded in converting a low-affinity SBD into a high-affinity receptor and vice versa. Our data indicate that a small number of residues that reside in the binding pocket constitute the major affinity determinants of the SBDs.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of Serbia and lowland regions of Croatia.
AB  - The goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (BG) and nine fresh soft (ZG) artisanal cheeses collected in Serbia and Croatia. While LAB were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all BG cheeses but only in three ZG cheese samples. High LAB and yeast species diversity was determined (average H'(L)=0.4 and H'(Y)=0.8, respectively). The predominant LAB species in white pickled (BG) cheeses were Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (ZG) cheeses the most dominant LAB species were L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. Among the 20 yeast species found, Debaryomyces hansenii, Candida zeylanoides, and Torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in BG cheeses, while Yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in ZG cheeses. The characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of LAB isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of LAB strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic or proteolytic activity. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of LAB and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. The knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific LAB and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.
TI  - Organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase (PYK) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. Lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of PYK in their metabolism. These organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. They include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of PYK by inorganic phosphate, the activation of PYK shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. System-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. These require knowledge of the identities of the enzyme modifiers. Here, we predict potential allosteric activators of PYKs from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. We used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of PYK. Specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. We then made a kinetic model of Lactococcus lactis PYK to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. This strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the Enterococcus faecalis PYK, and to predict that the PYKs from Streptococcus pyogenes and Lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. These differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. The combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.
TI  - Distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in Japan.
AB  - To determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the Japanese market, LAB were isolated using deMan, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar and MRS agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. From 38 imported and 24 Japanese cheeses, 409 LAB isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. The percentage of LAB resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of LAB resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in Japan (16.7%; P=0.04). Antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in Enterococcus faecalis (tetL, tetM, and ermB; tetL and ermB; tetM) E. faecium (tetM), Lactococcus lactis (tetS), Lactobacillus (Lb.), casei/paracasei (tetM or tetW), and Lb. rhamnosus (ermB) isolated from seven imported cheeses. Moreover, these E. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). Although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any LAB isolates from Japanese cheeses, Lb. casei/paracasei and Lb. coryniformis isolates from a Japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], 32 microg/mL). Leuconostoc isolates from three Japanese farm-made cheeses were also resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (MIC, 32 to >512 microg/mL). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant LAB in imported and Japanese farm-made cheeses on the Japanese market, but not in Japanese commercial cheeses.
TI  - Kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from Streptococcus pyogenes M49.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. S. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ADS) for survival in acidic environments. In this study, the arginine deiminase (AD), and carbamate kinase (CK) from S. pyogenes M49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. AD and CK from S. pyogenes M49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and Enterococcus faecalis V583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). We found that the arginine deiminase of S. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., ATP, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). The Km and Vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mM (mean+/-SD) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. The carbamate kinase is inhibited by ATP but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. The Km and Vmax values for ADP were 0.72+/-0.08mM and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the Km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mM. The optimum pH and temperature for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively.
TI  - Construction and potential application of controlled autolytic systems for Lactobacillus casei in cheese manufacture.
AB  - The rapid release of intracellular enzymes into the curd by the autolysis of lactic acid bacteria starters is universally recognized as a critical biological process to accelerate cheese ripening. Lactobacillus casei is typically the dominant nonstarter lactic acid bacterium in the ripening cheese. In this study, two controlled autolytic systems were established in L. casei BL23, based on the exploitation of the autolysins sourced from Lactococcus lactis (AcmA) and Enterococcus faecalis (AtlA). The lysis abilities of the systems were demonstrated both in broth and a model cheese, in which a fivefold increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity was detected in the curd with sufficient viable starter cells being maintained, indicating that they could lead to the timely release of intracellular enzymes.
TI  - Regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) display differences in their regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. We combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), phosphate (Pi), and ionic strength (NaCl concentration) on six LDHs from four LABs studied at pH 6 and pH 7. We found that 1) the extent of activation by FBP (Kact) differs. Lactobacillus plantarum LDH is not regulated by FBP, but the other LDHs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: Enterococcus faecalis LDH2 </= Lactococcus lactis LDH2 < E. faecalis LDH1 < L. lactis LDH1 </= Streptococcus pyogenes LDH. This trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the LDH enzymes. 2) For L. plantarum, S. pyogenes, and E. faecalis, the effects of Pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding NaCl. 3) Addition of Pi inhibits E. faecalis LDH2, whereas in the absence of FBP, Pi is an activator of S. pyogenes LDH, E. faecalis LDH1, and L. lactis LDH1 and LDH2 at pH 6. These effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of Pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to pH 6 and pH 7. Overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of Pi, FBP, and pH that results in different regulatory effects on the LDHs of different LABs.
TI  - Production of tyramine by Enterococcus faecalis strains in water-boiled salted duck.
AB  - The potential to produce biogenic amines was investigated with 15 Lactococcus lactis and 15 Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from water-boiled salted duck. The production of biogenic amines from the isolated strains grown in de Man Rogosa Sharpe broth containing precursor amino acids was determined by thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. None of the L. lactis strains produced any biogenic amines, whereas 12 strains of E. faecalis produced tyramine and b -phenylethylamine. PCR assays were used to detect the presence of tyrosine decarboxylase genes in all of the isolated strains. Only the 12 biogenic amine-producing Enterococcus strains had a 924-bp fragment characteristic for the tyrosine decarboxylase gene. The comparison of the amplified partial tyrDC gene sequences of the 12 positive Enterococcus strains revealed 99% similarity within the same species. The tyramine production of the sterilized water-boiled salted duck inoculated with E. faecalis R612Z1 increased significantly during storage. This study reveals that the isolated E. faecalis strains can produce tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine in the medium; however, they can only produce tyramine in water-boiled salted duck.
TI  - Determination of the mode of action of enterolysin A, produced by Enterococcus faecalis B9510.
AB  - AIM: The current study aimed to visualize the damage caused by enterolysin A to the cells of sensitive strains and to find out cleavage site within the peptidoglycan moiety of bacterial cell walls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterolysin A produced by a local isolate, Enterococcus faecalis B9510 was found to rapidly kill cells of the sensitive strain Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 2144 during 120 min of treatment as compared to the untreated control where no such effect was observed. Transmission electron microscopy of the enterolysin A-treated cells revealed leaking of the cytoplasmic contents ultimately resulting in complete lysis of cell walls. To find the cleavage site, purified cell walls of L. lactis ssp. cremoris 2144, Pediococcus pentosaceus 43201 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 were treated with enterolysin A, and liberated amino acids were derivatized for N and C terminals and analysed using thin layer chromatography on silica gel with isopropanol as solvent. The results showed that enterolysin A cleaves the peptide bonds at two locations within peptidoglycan subunits. The first location is between L-alanine and D-glutamic acid of the stem peptide and the other location is between L-lysine of the stem peptide and D-aspartic acid of the interpeptide bridge. CONCLUSIONS: Enterolysin A cleaves the peptide bonds within the stem peptide as well as in the interpeptide bridge of Gram-positive bacterial cell walls. This gives a possible reason for the broad spectrum of enterolysin A activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report identifying the cleavage site of enterolysin A within the cell walls of sensitive bacteria. This will help in identifying potential applications for enterolysin A.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Exploring optimization parameters to increase ssDNA recombineering in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering is a technology which is used to make  subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. Cells which express a single-stranded DNA binding protein (RecT or Bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent mechanism. By in silico analysis we identified ssDNA binding protein homologs in the genus Lactobacillus and Lactococcus lactis. To assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 we expressed several RecT homologs in this strain. RecT derived from Enterococcus faecalis CRMEN 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native RecT protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. We successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in L. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (PTOs). Surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor PTO linkages enhanced recombineering in L. reuteri 6475. To emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of L. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. Directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssDNA recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.
TI  - Effects of cow's and goat's milk as fermentation media on the microbial ecology of sugary kefir grains.
AB  - In the present study, we have investigated the importance of fermentation media on grain formation and the microbial characteristics of sugary kefir. The sugary kefir grains were fermented in brown sugar, cow's milk or goat's milk. Using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, we identified the microorganisms present in both the grains and filtrate and then evaluated their distribution. The structure of the grains was also observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The identification results indicated that there were remarkable changes in microbial ecological profiles of the sugary kefir grains and their filtrates when brown sugar and milk were compared as fermentation media. Three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species (Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus mali and Lactobacillus hordei) were found in the grains fermented using brown sugar. However, four species, named Leu. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified in the grains fermented using either cow's or goat's milk. The size and structure of the kefir grains were also significantly influenced by the culture medium. We hypothesize that the grains originally may contain many different microorganisms and the identified changes are an adaption to each specific medium during grain formation and growth. The distribution of strains thus may vary depending on the carbon and energy sources available for grain fermentation and these microbial changes will further affect the granulation and growth of the grains. This study is important to our understanding of the mechanism of kefir grain formation and growth because it explores the relationship between fermentation media and kefir microorganisms.
TI  - Fluorescent protein vectors for promoter analysis in lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Fluorescent reporter genes are valuable tools for real-time monitoring of gene expression in living cells. In this study we describe the construction of novel promoter-probe vectors containing a synthetic mCherry fluorescent protein gene, codon-optimized for lactic acid bacteria, divergently linked, or not, to a gene encoding the S65T and F64L variant of the green fluorescent protein. The utility of the transcriptional fusion vectors was demonstrated by the cloning of a single or two divergent promoter regions and by the quantitative evaluation of fluorescence during growth of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass Dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  - The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. In the present study, 47 LAB strains were isolated from farmed seabass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16S rDNA and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA - polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecium (59%), Enterococcus faecalis (21%), Enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), Enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), Enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and Lactococcus lactis (1 strain). An Aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. The survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. Different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. More than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum, and Carnobacterium sp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.
TI  - Biodiversity and growth dynamics of lactic acid bacteria in artisanal PDO Ossau-Iraty cheeses made from raw ewe's milk with different starters.
AB  - The biodiversity and growth dynamics of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) in farm-house  Ossau-Iraty cheeses were investigated from vat milk to 180 days of ripening in six independent batches made from six raw ewe's milks using five typical cheese-making methods. Commercial starter S1 was used for three batches, starter S1 combined with S2 for one batch and no starter for two batches. Up to ten LAB species from five genera and up to two strains per species were identified per milk; up to eleven species from five genera and up to three strains per species were identified per cheese. Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were detected in all cheeses. Lactococci reached the highest counts irrespective of the milk and starter used. Lactococci and enterococci increased during manufacture, and mesophilic lactobacilli increased during ripening. Strain and species numbers, the percentage of isolates originating from the raw milk, maximum counts of each genus/species and time for reaching them, all varied according to whether or not a starter was used and the composition of the starter. The genotypes of strains within species varied according to the raw milk used. This generated distinct LAB microbiotas throughout manufacture and ripening that will certainly impact on the characteristics of the ripened cheeses.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in Inner Mongolia of China.
AB  - Sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of Inner Mongolia in China.  It has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. In this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in Inner Mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by classical biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay of recA gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor Tu). The results revealed that all the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) paracasei (38 strains), L. fermentum (28 strains), L. plantarum (7 strains), L. brevis (4 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. amylolyticus (1 strain), Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (3 strains), E. italicus (2 strains) or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). The predominant LAB were L. casei and L. fermentum in sour congee samples. The diversity of LAB derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and RFLP patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the L. casei group.
TI  - Protein expression vector and secretion signal peptide optimization to drive the  production, secretion, and functional expression of the bacteriocin enterocin A in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Replacement of the leader sequence (LS) of the bacteriocin enterocin A (LS(entA)) by the signal peptides (SP) of the protein Usp45 (SP(usp45)), and the bacteriocins enterocin P (SP(entP)), and hiracin JM79 (SP(hirJM79)) permits the production, secretion, and functional expression of EntA by different lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Chimeric genes encoding the SP(usp45), the SP(entP), and the SP(hirJM79) fused to mature EntA plus the EntA immunity genes (entA+entiA) were cloned into the expression vectors pNZ8048 and pMSP3545, under control of the inducible P(nisA) promoter, and in pMG36c, under control of the constitutive P(32) promoter. The amount, antimicrobial activity, and specific antimicrobial activity of the EntA produced by the recombinant Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus acidilactici hosts varied depending on the signal peptide, the expression vector, and the host strain. However, the antimicrobial activity and the specific antimicrobial activity of the EntA produced by most of the LAB transformants was lower than expected from their production. The supernatants of the recombinant L. lactis NZ9000 (pNZUAI) and L. lactis NZ9000 (pNZHAI), overproducers of EntA, showed a 1.2- to 5.1-fold higher antimicrobial activity than that of the natural producer E. faecium T136 against different Listeria spp.
TI  - Characterization of certain bacterial strains for potential use as starter or probiotic cultures in dairy products.
AB  - The present work was aimed at characterizing 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to obtain improved potential starter or probiotic cultures that could be used for making dairy products from ewe's milk and cow's milk. Eight strains with antimicrobial properties, isolated from ewe's milk and from cheese made from ewe's and/or cow's milk, were studied. They were identified as Enterococcus faecalis (five strains), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (one strain of each species). Additionally, four strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection: Lactobacillus casei 393 (isolated from cheese), L. lactis subsp. lactis 11454 (origin nonspecified and a producer of nisin), and two strains isolated from human feces (L. paracasei subsp. paracasei 27092 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus 53103, antibacterial agent producer). All E. faecalis strains showed at least one virulence factor (either hemolysin or gelatinase), which emphasizes the importance of these studies in this species. Both L. lactis strains and most Lactobacillus spp. were good acidifiers in ewe's milk and cow's milk at 30 degrees C. High beta-galactosidase activity, as well as aminopeptidase activities that favor the development of desirable flavors in cheese, were detected in all Lactobacillus spp. strains. Furthermore, L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 showed alpha-fucosidase activity (thought to help colonization of the intestine) and lack of alpha-glucosidase activity (a trait considered positive for diabetic and obese humans). This last enzymatic activity was also lacking in L. lactis ATCC 11454. L. mesenteroides was the only strain D(2)-lactic acid producer. The selection of any particular strain for probiotic or dairy cultures should be performed according to the technological and/or functional abilities needed.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Oxalate-degrading capacities of lactic acid bacteria in canine feces.
AB  - In this study, lactic acid bacteria in canine feces were isolated and identified, and their oxalate-degrading capacities were evaluated. The oxalate-degrading capacities were determined for 24 of 47 (51.06%) lactic acid bacteria isolates. Of these, 8 isolates [Leuconostoc mesenteroides (RL75), Lactococcus garvieae (CD2), Lactococcus subsp. lactis (CS21), Enterococcus faecium (CL71 and CL72), and Enterococcus faecalis (CD14, CS62, and CD12)] degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present, while the others degraded less than 5% of the oxalate in vitro. Isolates that degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present were selected for further examination. The oxalate-degrading capacities of individual isolates, a mixture of Enterococcus, a mixture of Lactococcus, and a mixture of the eight isolates were evaluated in media containing different concentrations of glucose (sufficient, insufficient, or no glucose). In comparison with the control medium, all of the individual isolates and mixtures of isolates could degrade oxalate in all three groups (P<0.05). In most cases, the isolates growing in medium with 20 g/L of glucose had higher oxalate-degrading capacities than those growing in medium with 2.5 g/L of glucose or no glucose. The mixture of all isolates showed higher oxalate-degrading capacity than the individual isolates and other mixtures. The oxalate-degrading capacities of the isolates were isolate dependent.
TI  - Potential application of the nisin Z preparation of Lactococcus lactis W8 in preservation of milk.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin Z from Lactococcus lactis W8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees C were identified as Enterococcus italicus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter aerogenes. These bacteria were found to have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. Except Enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin Z preparation of the L. lactis W8. Addition of the nisin Z preparation to either the skim milk or fat milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log CFU ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. The nisin Z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. CONCLUSIONS: The nisin Z preparation from L. lactis W8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin Z preparation of L. lactis W8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin A). The nisin Z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.
TI  - Diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a South African food.
AB  - Ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. Insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. In this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of V3-16S rRNA gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16S rRNA and/or pheS gene sequence analysis. The entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to pH evolution and microbial succession. The first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by relatively high pH conditions and the presence of Enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. The second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Weissella cibaria, Enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of Lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The Lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with PCR-DGGE, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. These findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.
TI  - Host range of enterococcal vanA plasmids among Gram-positive intestinal bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vanA transposon Tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in Enterococcus faecium. The limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of Tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. We investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vanA-containing plasmids hosted by E. faecium (n = 9), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and Enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. METHODS: A filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. Donor strains were mated with three E. faecium recipients, three E. faecalis recipients, a Lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a Lactococcus lactis recipient and two Bifidobacterium recipients. Transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. Transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. Stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. RESULTS: In total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. In summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. All recipients of the same species behaved similarly. Inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pIP501/pAMbeta1) only. Acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in the new host. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-species transfer of enterococcal vanA plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vanA-containing plasmids among E. faecium. A reservoir of vanA plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.
TI  - Characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants shows optimization for YATP (cell mass produced per mole of ATP) at their physiological pHs.
AB  - Several lactic acid bacteria use homolactic acid fermentation for generation of ATP. Here we studied the role of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme on the general physiology of the three homolactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Of note, deletion of the ldh genes hardly affected the growth rate in chemically defined medium under microaerophilic conditions. However, the growth rate was affected in rich medium. Furthermore, deletion of ldh affected the ability for utilization of various substrates as a carbon source. A switch to mixed acid fermentation was observed during glucose-limited continuous growth and was dependent on the growth rate for S. pyogenes and on the pH for E. faecalis. In S. pyogenes and L. lactis, a change in pH resulted in a clear change in Y(ATP) (cell mass produced per mole of ATP). The pH that showed the highest Y(ATP) corresponded to the pH of the natural habitat of the organisms.
TI  - Detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for enumeration of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci was established. Subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16S or 23S rRNA from Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus were newly developed. The RT-qPCR method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the Enterococcus genus, the Streptococcus genus, and several Streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qPCR method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces). The RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the genus-specific primer sets revealed that Enterococcus and Streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), respectively. Detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique Enterococcus species, including the E. avium subgroup, the E. faecium subgroup, E. faecalis, the E. casseliflavus subgroup, and E. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal Streptococcus species was found to be S. salivarius. Various Lactococcus species, such as L. lactis subsp. lactis or L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. garvieae, L. piscium, and L. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram feces) and prevalence (33%). These results suggest that the RT-qPCR method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Enzymatic activity of lactic acid bacteria (with antimicrobial properties) isolated from a traditional Spanish cheese.
AB  - Twenty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from a traditional Spanish cheese (Genestoso cheese) were evaluated for their enzymatic activities (acidifying and proteolytic abilities and carboxypeptidase, aminopeptidase, dipeptidase, caseinolytic and esterase activities), in order to select indigenous strains of technical interest for the manufacture of cheese. These strains were selected on the basis of their antimicrobial activity relative to five reference strains and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (thirteen strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (two strains), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (one strain), Lactobacillus paracasei (two strains), Lactobacillus plantarum (one strain) and Enterococcus faecalis (five strains). Lactococcus strains were those that showed the greatest degree of acidifying and proteolytic activity. The cell-free extracts (CFE) of L. paracasei exhibited the highest level of aminopeptidase activity. The highest level of caseinolytic activity was shown by the CFE of one strain of L. lactis. High values were also obtained with the CFE of Lactobacillus and of several Leuconostoc. The highest level of dipeptidase activity was found amongst the strains of L. lactis. Carboxypeptidase activity was generally very low or undetectable for the majority of strains. The greatest degree of esterolytic activity was detected for Enterococcus.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Artisanal Italian goat cheese.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in Valsesia (Piemonte, Italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. These cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. Three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic DNA plus PCR analysis. Bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. Their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log CFU ml(-1). Their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. The growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus garviae, and Enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of Enterococcus (E. faecium, E. durans, E. gilvus, and E. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. Occasionally, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, and Lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.
TI  - Identification of tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci within the fermenting microflora of an Italian dairy food product.
AB  - AIMS: Microbiological and molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive cocci derived from the Italian PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) dairy food product Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and seven coccal colonies were assigned to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus bovis genera by ARDRA analysis (amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis). Among them, 16 Ent. faecalis, 26 L. lactis and 39 Strep. bovis displayed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for tetracycline, while 17 L. lactis showed high MIC values for both tetracycline and erythromycin. Strain typing and molecular analysis of the phenotypically resistant isolates demonstrated the presence of the tet(M) gene in the tetracycline-resistant strains and of tet(S) and erm(B) in the double-resistant strains. Southern blot analysis revealed plasmid localization of L. lactis tet(M), as well as of the erm(B) and tet(S) genes. Genetic linkage of erm(B) and tet(S) was also demonstrated by PCR amplification. Conjugation experiments demonstrated horizontal transfer to Ent. faecalis strain JH2-2 only for the plasmid-borne L. lactis tet(M) gene. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized tetracycline-and erythromycin-resistance genes in coccal species, representing the fermenting microflora of a typical Italian dairy product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results are of particular relevance from the food safety viewpoint, especially in the light of the potential risk of horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes among foodborne commensal bacteria.
TI  - Characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from Irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 Leuconostoc, and 2 pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the E-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. The corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by PCR. Also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. Of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The erm(B) and msrA/B genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. Two tetracycline-resistant strains, Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(M) and tet(S) genes respectively. Intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and Leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (strA, strB, aadA, aadE) were identified. Four of 10 strains of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this phenotype were identified. Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. L. plantarum, L. mesenteroides and Pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. Transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(M) gene of L. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to Lactococcus lactis BU-2-60 and to E. faecalis JH2-2. This study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in Irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other LAB strains.
TI  - Genotype and gene expression associations with immune function in Drosophila.
AB  - It is now well established that natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster harbor substantial genetic variation associated with physiological measures of immune function. In no case, however, have intermediate measures of immune function, such as transcriptional activity of immune-related genes, been tested as mediators of phenotypic variation in immunity. In this study, we measured bacterial load sustained after infection of D. melanogaster with Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactococcus lactis in a panel of 94 third-chromosome substitution lines. We also measured transcriptional levels of 329 immune-related genes eight hours after infection with E. faecalis and S. marcescens in lines from the phenotypic tails of the test panel. We genotyped the substitution lines at 137 polymorphic markers distributed across 25 genes in order to test for statistical associations among genotype, bacterial load, and transcriptional dynamics. We find that genetic polymorphisms in the pathogen recognition genes (and particularly in PGRP-LC, GNBP1, and GNBP2) are most significantly associated with variation in bacterial load. We also find that overall transcriptional induction of effector proteins is a significant predictor of bacterial load after infection with E. faecalis, and that a marker upstream of the recognition gene PGRP-SD is statistically associated with variation in both bacterial load and transcriptional induction of effector proteins. These results show that polymorphism in genes near the top of the immune system signaling cascade can have a disproportionate effect on organismal phenotype due to the amplification of minor effects through the cascade.
TI  - The lactococcin G immunity protein recognizes specific regions in both peptides constituting the two-peptide bacteriocin lactococcin G.
AB  - Lactococcin G and enterocin 1071 are two homologous two-peptide bacteriocins. Expression vectors containing the gene encoding the putative lactococcin G immunity protein (lagC) or the gene encoding the enterocin 1071 immunity protein (entI) were constructed and introduced into strains sensitive to one or both of the bacteriocins. Strains that were sensitive to lactococcin G became immune to lactococcin G when expressing the putative lactococcin G immunity protein, indicating that the lagC gene in fact encodes a protein involved in lactococcin G immunity. To determine which peptide or parts of the peptide(s) of each bacteriocin that are recognized by the cognate immunity protein, combinations of wild-type peptides and hybrid peptides from the two bacteriocins were assayed against strains expressing either of the two immunity proteins. The lactococcin G immunity protein rendered the enterococcus strain but not the lactococcus strains resistant to enterocin 1071, indicating that the functionality of the immunity protein depends on a cellular component. Moreover, regions important for recognition by the immunity protein were identified in both peptides (Lcn-alpha and Lcn-beta) constituting lactococcin G. These regions include the N-terminal end of Lcn-alpha (residues 1 to 13) and the C-terminal part of Lcn-beta (residues 14 to 24). According to a previously proposed structural model of lactococcin G, these regions will be positioned adjacent to each other in the transmembrane helix-helix structure, and the model thus accommodates the present results.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2.
TI  - Assessment of antimicrobial resistance transfer between lactic acid bacteria and  potential foodborne pathogens using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix.
AB  - The transferability of antimicrobial resistance from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to potential pathogenic strains was studied using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix. Five LAB donors containing either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance markers on transferable elements were conjugally mated with LAB (Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis) and pathogenic strains (Listeria spp., Salmonella ssp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli). In vitro transfer experiments were carried out with the donors and recipients using both the filter and plate mating methods. The food matrix consisted of fermented whole milk (fermented with the LAB donors) with the pathogenic recipients added as contaminants during the production process. All transconjugants were confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. Erythromycin resistance transfer from LAB strains to Listeria spp. was observed using both in vitro mating methods at high transfer frequencies of up to 5.1 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient. Also, high frequency transfer (ranging from 2.7 x 10(-8) up to 1.1 x 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient) of both erythromycin and tetracycline-resistance was observed between LAB species using in vitro methods. No resistance transfer was observed to Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli. The only conjugal transfer observed in the fermented milk matrix was for tetracycline resistance between two LAB strains (at a transfer frequency of 2.6 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipients). This study demonstrates the transfer of antimicrobial resistance from LAB to Listeria spp. using in vitro methods and also the transfer of resistance between LAB species in a food matrix. It highlights the involvement of LAB as a potential source of resistance determinants that may be disseminated between LAB and pathogenic strains including Listeria spp. Furthermore, it indicates that food matrices such as fermented milks may provide a suitable environment to support gene exchange.
TI  - Polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with Tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  - The objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected from different areas of Tunisia. A polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal DNA-based techniques, was used to identify Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates. PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR of 102 isolates and other reference LAB strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (M-ISR) for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and M-ISR) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and L-ISR) for Lactobacilli, and (4) three PCR amplicons (S-ISR, M-ISR, and L-ISR) obtained for Pediococcus spp. and Weissella genus. The clustering and comparison of ISR-RFLP profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference LAB strains, allowed their identification as Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Enterococcus hawaiiensis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Weissella confusa. Combined 16S-23S rDNA ISR and RFLP patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of LAB and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.
TI  - Intra- and interspecies conjugal transfer of Tn916-like elements from Lactococcus lactis in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Lactococcus lactis strains originally isolated from Polish raw milk were analyzed for the ability to transfer their antibiotic resistance genes in vitro, using filter mating experiments, and in vivo, using germfree rats. Four of six analyzed L. lactis isolates were able to transfer tetracycline resistance determinants in vitro to L. lactis Bu2-60, at frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient. Three of these four strains could also transfer resistance in vitro to Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, whereas no transfer to Bacillus subtilis YBE01, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Agrobacterium tumefaciens UBAPF2, or Escherichia coli JE2571 was observed. Rats were initially inoculated with the recipient E. faecalis strain JH2-2, and after a week, the L. lactis IBB477 and IBB487 donor strains were introduced. The first transconjugants were detected in fecal samples 3 days after introduction of the donors. A subtherapeutic concentration of tetracycline did not have any significant effect on the number of transconjugants, but transconjugants were observed earlier in animals dosed with this antibiotic. Molecular analysis of in vivo transconjugants containing the tet(M) gene showed that this gene was identical to tet(M) localized on the conjugative transposon Tn916. Primer-specific PCR confirmed that the Tn916 transposon was complete in all analyzed transconjugants and donors. This is the first study showing in vivo transfer of a Tn916-like antibiotic resistance transposon from L. lactis to E. faecalis. These data suggest that in certain cases food lactococci might be involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and DNA identification of atypical Lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. By combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16S rRNA gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west Algeria. Forty strains phenotypically related to cocci LAB were identified as belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and other Enterococcus species. No Streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. Ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. In particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% NaCl, at pH 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. Lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. Further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Changes in the microbial composition of raw milk induced by thermization treatments applied prior to traditional Greek hard cheese processing.
AB  - The microbiological quality, safety, and composition of mixtures of ewe's and goat's milk (90:10) used for cheesemaking were evaluated before and after thermization at 60 and 67 degrees C for 30 s. Such mild thermal treatments are commonly applied to reduce natural contaminants of raw milk before processing for traditional hard Greek cheeses. Raw milk samples had an average total bacterial count of 7.3 log CFU/ml; most of these bacteria were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and pseudomonads. The LAB flora of raw milk was dominated by enterococci (40.8%), followed by lactococci (20.4%), leuconostocs (18.4%), and mesophilic lactobacilli (10.2%). Enterococcus faecalis (30.1%) and Enterococcus faecium (13.7%) were the most common LAB isolates, followed by Enterococcus durans, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc lactis. Thermization at 60 degrees C for 30 s was effective for reducing raw milk contamination by enterobacteria (5.1 log CFU/ml), coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.3 log CFU/ml), and Listeria (present in 25-ml samples) to safe levels, but it also reduced mesophilic lactococci, leuconostocs, lactobacilli, and selected enterococci (72.0%) in thermized milk. Thermization at 67 degrees C for 30 s had a major inactivation effect on all bacterial groups. Two nisin-producing L. lactis subsp. lactis strains (M78 and M104) were isolated from raw milk, but neither nisin-producing nor other bacteriocin-producing LAB strains were isolated from thermized milk. Thus, thermization treatments control harmful bacteria but also may have a negative impact on milk quality by reducing desirable LAB and the biodiversity of raw milk bacteria overall, inactivating potentially protective LAB strains and enhancing the ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci to grow in fresh cheese curds.
TI  - Characterization of a small erythromycin resistance plasmid pLFE1 from the food-isolate Lactobacillus plantarum M345.
AB  - This paper reports the complete 4031 bp nucleotide sequence of the small erythromycin resistance plasmid pLFE1 isolated from the raw-milk cheese isolate Lactobacillus plantarum M345. Analysis of the sequence revealed the coding regions for the erythromycin resistance determinant Erm(B). A replication initiation protein RepB was identified belonging to the RepB proteins of the pMV158 family of rolling-circle replicating plasmids. The transcriptional repressor protein CopG and a small counter transcribed RNA, two elements typically involved in replication control within this family were also found. A putative replication initiation site including a single-strand origin (sso) -like region succeeded by a characteristic pMV158 family double-strand origin (dso) was located upstream of the replication region. An open reading frame following a typical origin of transfer (oriT) site and coding for a putative truncated mobilization (Mob) protein with a size of 83 aa was detected. The product of the putative mob gene showed large similarity to the N-terminal region of the pMV158 family of Pre/Mob proteins, but was much smaller than other proteins of this family. We therefore suggest that the Mob function in pLFE1 is supplied in trans from another plasmid present in L. plantarum M345.Filter-mating experiments showed that pLFE1 has a broad host-range with transconjugants obtained from Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, Listeria innocua, the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis and the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - P087, a lactococcal phage with a morphogenesis module similar to an Enterococcus  faecalis prophage.
AB  - The virulent lactococcal phage P087 was isolated from a dairy environment in 1978. This phage was then recognized as the reference member for one of the ten phage groups currently known to infect Lactococcus lactis strains. The double-stranded DNA genome of this Siphoviridae phage is composed of 60,074 bp and is circularly permuted. Five tRNA and 88 orfs were found within an uncommon genome architecture. Eleven structural proteins were also identified through SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analyses. Of note, 11 translated orfs from the structural module of phage P087 have identities to gene products found in a prophage located in the genome of Enterococcus faecalis V583. The alignment of both genomic sequences suggests that DNA exchanges could occur between these two phages which are infecting low G+C bacteria found in similar ecological niches.
TI  - Study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for Fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  - The bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of Fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. Total microbial DNA was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to study the hypervariable V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Representative bands of DGGE patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. The use of universal primer for PCR-DGGE allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also for other adventitious species. DGGE profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. Some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) recurred in many samples (Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. The microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant LAB but also adventitious bacteria (Macrococcus caseolyticus, Rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (Chryseobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees C of coagulated milk. Pantoea spp. was primarily found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. Finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of E. faecium, E. faecalis and S. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. These species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements ICESt1 and ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. The current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ICEs in Streptococcus thermophilus, ICESt1 and ICESt3. Mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent, derepresses ICESt3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. The ICESt3 host range was determined using various members of the Firmicutes as recipients. Whereas numerous ICESt3 transconjugants of Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of Lactococcus lactis was obtained. The newly incoming ICEs, except the one from L. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. Furthermore, ICESt3 was retransferred from E. faecalis to S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the ICESt1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ICEs, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.
TI  - Development of chemically defined media supporting high-cell-density growth of lactococci, enterococci, and streptococci.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was used as an experimental strain to develop a chemically defined medium for study of the physiology and metabolic pathways of lactococci. An experimental leave-one-out technique was employed to determine the necessity of each of the 57 chemical components used in medium development. A statistical experimental design approach including three fractional factorial designs and a central composite design was used to optimize the fermentation process with 21 variables composed of 19 nutritional factors grouped from the 57 components and two environmental factors (initial pH and temperature). For L. lactis IL1403, the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the two optimal chemically defined media developed in this study (ZMB1 and ZMB2) were generally 3.5- to 4-fold higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the previously described best synthetic media (SA) and 50% to 68% higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with M17, a complex medium commonly used for lactococci. The new chemically defined media support high-cell-density growth of numerous strains of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The expression of pathogenicity-related extracellular proteases, namely, gelatinase and serine protease, in Enterococcus faecalis is positively regulated by a quorum-sensing system mediated by an autoinducing peptide called gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (GBAP). GBAP is an 11-amino-acid-residue cyclic peptide containing a lactone linkage. To study the structure-activity relationship of GBAP, we synthesized a series of GBAP analogues and evaluated their activities by a gelatinase-inducing assay and newly developed receptor-binding assays in which fluorescence-labeled peptides bound onto the FsrC-overexpressing Lactococcus lactis cell surface were observed by fluorescent microscopy and quantified by using a fluorophotometer. Alanine-scanning analysis of GBAP showed that the entire ring region was involved in the GBAP agonist activity, while side chains of the tail region were not strictly recognized. The alanine substitution of Phe(7) or Trp(10) almost abolished their receptor-binding abilities and GBAP agonist activities, suggesting that these two aromatic side chains are strongly involved in receptor interaction and activation. Furthermore, the Trp(10) substitution with natural and unnatural aromatic amino acids, except pentafluorophenylalanine, caused no loss of agonist activity. This suggested the importance of a negative electrostatic potential created by an pi-electron cloud on the aromatic ring surface. Structural analysis of GBAP with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the ring region adopted a hairpin-like fold and was tightly packed into a compact form. The side chain of Trp(10) was partially buried in the core structure, contributing to the stabilization of the compact form, while that of Phe(7) was extended from the core structure into the solvent and was probably directly involved in receptor binding.
TI  - Vectors for Lactobacilli and other Gram-positive bacteria based on the minimal replicon of pRV500 from Lactobacillus sakei.
AB  - The low-copy-number plasmid pRV500, belonging to the pUCL287 group of theta-type  plasmids, was previously isolated from Lactobacillus sakei and characterized. We show here that the replicon of this plasmid enables replication also in Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis but not in Lactococcus lactis. A 1.25 kb region encompassing the iterons and the repA gene was sufficient for replication, copy-number control and relative stable maintenance in L. sakei. Functional implications of host or plasmid-borne factors in the maintenance of pUCL287-type plasmids are discussed. The minimal replicon from pRV500 was fused to pBluescript for constructing the shuttle E. coli/lactobacilli cloning vector pRV610. pRV610 enables the white/blue lacZ alpha-complementation in E. coli. The cassettes for selection (erythromycin resistance) and replication (iterons and repA gene) are each bordered by unique restriction sites for easy replacement if needed. Derivatives in which chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance replaced erythromycin resistance were constructed. In order to allow inducible gene expression, a copper-inducible promoter was placed on the pRV613 derivative. Expression of the downstream reporter gene lacZ was shown to be induced by 30 microM CuSO(4).
TI  - The Lactococcus lactis FabF fatty acid synthetic enzyme can functionally replace  both the FabB and FabF proteins of Escherichia coli and the FabH protein of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The genome of Lactococcus lactis encodes a single long chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase. This is in contrast to its close relative, Enterococcus faecalis, and to Escherichia coli, both of which have two such enzymes. In E. faecalis and E. coli, one of the two long chain synthases (FabO and FabB, respectively) has a role in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis that cannot be satisfied by FabF, the other long chain synthase. Since L. lactis has only a single long chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (annotated as FabF), it seemed likely that this enzyme must function both in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and in elongation of short chain acyl carrier protein substrates to the C18 fatty acids found in the cellular phospholipids. We report that this is the case. Expression of L. lactis FabF can functionally replace both FabB and FabF in E. coli, although it does not restore thermal regulation of phospholipid fatty acid composition to E. coli fabF mutant strains. The lack of thermal regulation was predictable because wild-type L. lactis was found not to show any significant change in fatty acid composition with growth temperature. We also report that overproduction of L. lactis FabF allows growth of an L. lactis mutant strain that lacks the FabH short chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase. The strain tested was a derivative (called the fabH bypass strain) of the original fabH deletion strain that had acquired the ability to grow when supplemented with octanoate. Upon introduction of a FabF overexpression plasmid into this strain, growth proceeded normally in the absence of fatty acid supplementation. Moreover, this strain had a normal rate of fatty acid synthesis and a normal fatty acid composition. Both the fabH bypass strain that overproduced FabF and the wild type strain incorporated much less exogenous octanoate into long chain phospholipid fatty acids than did the fabH bypass strain. Incorporation of octanoate and decanoate labeled with deuterium showed that these acids were incorporated intact as the distal methyl and methylene groups of the long chain fatty acids.
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - Effect of Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis on the behaviour of Staphylococcus aureus in microfiltered milk.
AB  - The effect of four strains of Lactococcus garvieae, three strains of Lactococcus  lactis and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis on Staphylococcus aureus SA15 growth in microfiltered milk was evaluated. Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were co-cultured with S. aureus in microfiltered milk and in medium buffered at pH 6.8. All Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were able to inhibit S. aureus growth after 6h of incubation. Inhibition by L. lactis and E. faecalis strains could be partially attributed to the decrease in pH below 6.0 as it has been observed in medium buffered at pH 6.8. L. garvieae strains were the most effective to inhibit S. aureus growth without acidification. Inhibition of S. aureus could not be attributed neither to production of lactate, acetate or nor to antistaphylococcal substance. Amino acids competition was not involved in the inhibition by L. garvieae as addition of valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine and phenylalanine did not suppress the inhibition of S. aureus.
TI  - Cloning and heterologous production of Hiracin JM79, a Sec-dependent bacteriocin  produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5, in lactic acid bacteria and Pichia pastoris.
AB  - Hiracin JM79 (HirJM79), a Sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5, was cloned and produced in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pichia pastoris. For heterologous production of HirJM79 in lactic acid bacteria (LAB), the HirJM79 structural gene (hirJM79), with or without the HirJM79 immunity gene (hiriJM79), was cloned into the plasmid pMG36c under the control of the constitutive promoter P(32) and into the plasmid pNZ8048 under the control of the inducible P(NisA) promoter. For the production of HirJM79 in P. pastoris, the gene encoding the mature HirJM79 protein was cloned into the pPICZalphaA expression vector. The recombinant plasmids permitted the production of biologically active HirJM79 in the supernatants of L. lactis IL1403, L. lactis NZ9000, L. sakei Lb790, E. faecalis JH2-2, and P. pastoris X-33, the coproduction of HirJM79 and nisin A in L. lactis DPC5598, and the coproduction of HirJM79 and enterocin P in E. faecium L50/14-2. All recombinant LAB produced larger quantities of HirJM79 than E. hirae DCH5, although the antimicrobial activities of most transformants were lower than that predicted from their production of HirJM79. The synthesis, processing, and secretion of HirJM79 proceed efficiently in recombinant LAB strains and P. pastoris.
TI  - Improved real-time PCR assays for the detection of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters with different instrument and reagent systems.
AB  - Previously reported and redesigned primer and probe assays were evaluated for the quantitative analysis of the fecal indicator bacterial groups, Enterococcus and Bacteroidetes with three real-time PCR instrument and reagent systems. The efficiency and sensitivity of the original assays varied between systems in analyses of DNA extracts from pure cultures of Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas the modified assays gave more consistent results. Distinctions between original and modified assays also occurred in analyses of known spike levels of E. faecalis and B. fragilis cells on filters with diverse surface water retentates. Percentages of samples causing PCR failures due to inhibition were lower using the modified assays. The accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements were also generally higher, although mean measurements of both target organisms were still significantly different between systems (p < 0.05). The accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements by both modified assays were further improved using a new sample matrix control spike consisting of cultured Lactococcus lactis cells and a reference assay for this organism. Corrections provided by the L. lactis assay eliminated significant differences in E. faecalis measurements between all three systems and between two of the three systems in B. fragilis measurements.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Bukuljac, a homemade goat's milk cheese.
AB  - The Bukuljac cheese is traditionally homemade cheese, produced from heat-treated  goat's milk without the addition of any bacterial starter culture. The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in Bukuljac cheese has been analyzed by using a polyphasic approach including microbiological and molecular methods such as rep-PCR with (GTG)5 primer. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei represents a dominant strain in the microflora of analyzed cheese. Out of 55 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates, 48 belonged to L. paracasei subsp. paracasei species. Besides lactobacilli, five Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and two Enterococcus faecalis were found. Results of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of DNA extracted directly from the fresh cheese revealed the presence of Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Only lactobacilli showed a high proteolytic activity and hydrolyzed alpha(s1)- and beta-caseins. They are also producers of diacetyl. In addition, 34 out of 55 isolates, all determined as lactobacilli, showed the ability of auto-aggregation. Among 55 isolates, 50 also exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Zlatar cheese.
AB  - AIMS: Isolation, characterization and identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from artisanal Zlatar cheese during the ripening process and selection of strains with good technological characteristics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Characterization of LAB was performed based on morphological, physiological and biochemical assays, as well as, by determining proteolytic activity and plasmid profile. rep-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing were used for the identification of LAB. PCR analysis was performed with specific primers for detection of the gene encoding nisin production. Strains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were the main groups present in the Zlatar cheese during ripening. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal changes in the species were observed during the Zlatar cheese ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli are predominant microflora in Zlatar cheese. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study we determined that Zlatar cheese up to 30 days old could be used as a source of strains for the preparation of potential starter cultures in the process of industrial cheese production. As the Serbian food market is adjusting to European Union regulations, the standardization of Zlatar cheese production by using starter culture(s) based on autochtonous well-characterized LAB will enable the industrial production of this popular cheese in the future.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Role of a qnr-like gene in the intrinsic resistance of Enterococcus faecalis to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are poorly active against enterococci. Recently, plasmid-borne resistance to fluoroquinolones due to the qnr gene was reported in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The gene encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects DNA gyrase from inhibition by fluoroquinolones. We have identified in the genome of Enterococcus faecalis V583 a qnr-like gene, named E. faecalis qnr (qnr(E. faecalis)), encoding a putative pentapeptide repeat protein that shares 25% identity with Qnr. To assess its potential role in the intrinsic resistance of E. faecalis to fluoroquinolones, qnr(E. faecalis) was inactivated in E. faecalis JH2-2 by insertion of the thermosensitive vector pG1KT. This strain was then complemented with qnr(E. faecalis) cloned in the multicopy plasmid pORI23. The effects of its overexpression were also studied. Inactivation of the qnr(E. faecalis) gene resulted in twofold decreases in the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. When the gene was complemented or overexpressed, MICs of fluoroquinolones increased four- to nine-fold, leading to MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin equal to 32 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively. The E. faecalis Qnr (Qnr(E. faecalis)) protein was produced and purified. Qnr(E. faecalis) protein protected Escherichia coli DNA gyrase from inhibition by ofloxacin. The qnr(E. faecalis) gene was then introduced into E. coli DH10B, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Lactococcus lactis IL-1419 to study its heterologous expression. MICs of the various fluoroquinolones tested increased 4- to 16-fold, showing that Qnr(E. faecalis) conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones in various bacterial backgrounds. Overexpression of qnr(E. faecalis) in enterococci or mobilization of the gene to other bacterial species may be anticipated as a possible new mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance.
TI  - Stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  - The microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of breeding conditions on their composition. The diversity of microbial communities was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16S rDNA from clone libraries (six milks). The stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of variable region V3 of the 16S rRNA gene and variable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene. One hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. Wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. In addition to species commonly encountered in milk, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus equorum, Micrococcus sp., Kocuria sp., Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter sp., Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, Clostridium sp. and Rothia sp. Several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Salinicoccus sp., Dietza maris, Exiguobacterium, Ornithinicoccus sp. and Hahella chejuensis. The yeast community was composed of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Trichosporon beigelii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula minuta, Candida pararugosa, Candida intermedia, Candida inconspicua, Cryptococcus curvatus and Cryptococcus magnus. The analyses of microbial counts and microbial SSCP profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding regime. The microbial community was stable within each period. Milks from winter were characterized by Lactococcus and Pseudomonas, those from summer by P. agglomerans and Klebsiella and those from autumn by Chryseobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and yeasts. However, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. This study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
TI  - In vivo functional analyses of the type II acyl carrier proteins of fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  - Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a key component of the fatty acid synthesis pathways of both type I and type II synthesis systems. A large number of structure-function studies of various type II ACPs have been reported, but all are in vitro studies that assayed function or interaction of mutant ACPs with various enzymes of fatty acid synthesis or transfer. Hence in these studies functional properties of various mutant ACPs were assayed with only a subset of the many ACP-interacting proteins, which may not give an accurate overall view of the function of these proteins in vivo. This is especially so because Escherichia coli ACP has been reported to interact with several proteins that have no known roles in lipid metabolism. We therefore tested a large number of mutant derivatives of E. coli ACP carrying single amino acid substitutions for their abilities to restore growth to an E. coli strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in acpP, the gene that encodes ACP. Many of these mutant proteins had previously been tested in vitro thus providing data for comparison with our results. We found that several mutant ACPs containing substitutions of ACP residues reported previously to be required for ACP function in vitro support normal growth of the acpP mutant strain. However, several mutant proteins reported to be severely defective in vitro failed to support growth of the acpP strain in vivo (or supported only weak growth). A collection of ACPs from diverse bacteria and from three eukaryotic organelles was also tested. All of the bacterial ACPs tested restored growth to the E. coli acpP mutant strain except those from two related bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis. Only one of the three eukaryotic organellar ACPs allowed growth. Strikingly the ACP is that of the apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum (the protozoan that causes malaria). The fact that an ACP from a such diverse organism can replace AcpP function in E. coli suggests that some of the protein-protein interactions detected for AcpP may be not be essential for growth of E. coli.
TI  - Characterization of the lactococcal group II intron target site in its native host.
AB  - The Lactococcus lactis group II intron (Ll.ltrB) retrohomes into the ltrB gene at high efficiency. To date, the critical DNA bases recognized in vivo by the Ll.ltrB ribonucleoprotein (RNP) have been exclusively elucidated in Escherichia coli. However, recent evidence indicates host-dependant differences in Ll.ltrB mobility, raising the possibility of limitations of the current model for RNP-homing site recognition in the native L. lactis host. In this work, intron retargeting experiments in L. lactis have demonstrated that adherence to specific target site critical bases is not sufficient to predict success or failure of chromosomal invasion, as in E. coli. Accordingly, a quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) assay was developed to test target site nucleotides previously demonstrated as critical for homing in E. coli, for relevance in its native host. This two-plasmid QPCR homing assay is highly sensitive and, unlike previous E. coli-based assays, resolves differential homing efficiencies in the absence of selection. As in E. coli, deviation from wild type at target site positions -23, -21, -20, -19, and +5 resulted in lower homing efficiencies in L. lactis. Furthermore, the same trends are observed when assaying select variants in Enterococcus faecalis. Our results suggest that these target site positions are critical in both E. coli and L. lactis.
TI  - Molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from Slovak Bryndza cheese.
AB  - Three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from Bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. The cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in Slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. All isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. Species-specific PCR using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of Enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species Enterococcus faecalis. The remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer (GTG)(5)-(GTG)(5)-PCR, in combination with phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase gene (pheS) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (SDS-PAGE). These strains were identified as Enterococcus durans (59 strains), Enterococcus italicus (8 strains), Enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), Enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), Enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species Lactococcus lactis. Of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, E. durans, E. faecalis and E. faecium were present in all samples studied, with E. faecium as the predominant one. The precise identification of enterococci in Bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.
TI  - Specificity determinants of conjugative DNA processing in the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pCF10 and the Lactococcus lactis plasmid pRS01.
AB  - The DNA-processing region of the Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmid pCF10 is highly similar to that of the otherwise unrelated plasmid pRS01 from Lactococcus lactis. A transfer-proficient pRS01 derivative was unable to mobilize plasmids containing the pCF10 origin of transfer, oriT. In contrast, pRS01 oriT-containing plasmids could be mobilized by pCF10 at a low frequency. Relaxases PcfG and LtrB were both capable of binding to single-stranded oriT DNAs; LtrB was highly specific for its cognate oriT, whereas PcfG could recognize both pCF10 and pRS01 oriT. However, pcfG was unable to complement an ltrB insertion mutation. Genetic analysis showed that pcfF of pCF10 and ltrF of pRS01 are also essential for plasmid transfer. Purified PcfF and LtrF possess double-stranded DNA binding activities for the inverted repeat within either oriT sequence. PcfG and LtrB were recruited into their cognate F-oriT DNA complex through direct interactions with their cognate accessory protein. PcfG also could interact with LtrF when pCF10 oriT was present. In vivo cross-complementation analysis showed that ltrF partially restored the pCF10DeltapcfF mutant transfer ability when provided in trans, whereas pcfF failed to complement an ltrF mutation. Specificity of conjugative DNA processing in these plasmids involves both DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the Lactococcus lactis sex factor and pRS01 plasmid to Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The low G+C gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis harbours two highly similar conjugative elements: an integrative and conjugative element called sex factor and the pRS01 plasmid. Originally, it was believed that the host range of the sex factor was limited to L. lactis subspecies. Here, it is reported that pTRK28 cointegrates of a spectinomycin-marked L. lactis sex factor and of the pRS01 conjugative plasmid can be transferred from L. lactis to Enterococcus faecalis. These results demonstrate the conjugative transfer of these elements to other bacterial species. Furthermore, it is reported that Ll.LtrB, a mobile group II intron carried by both elements, can invade its recognition site upon pRS01 conjugative transfer to E. faecalis.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Lactococcus lactis isolates from Batzos, a  Greek PDO raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - The genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 Lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of Batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. According to PFGE data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the L. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. Plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. Twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. There was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to PFGE. Clustering of strains according to RAPD-PCR was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and PFGE for the majority of the strains. In addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the season of cheese production. All strains inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Their ability to affect the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. In 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. The 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher Lys- than Leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher Leu- than Lys-aminopeptidase activity. Their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. The majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. These results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from Batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.
TI  - Characterization of microflora in homemade semi-hard white Zlatar cheese.
AB  - The Zlatar cheese belongs to the group of traditionally homemade cheeses, which are produced from nonpasteurized cow's milk, without adding of any bacterial starter culture. Changes were followed in lactic acid bacteria population and chemical composition during the ripening period of cheese up to 60 days. Results showed that the percentage of lactic acid cocci was higher in raw milk and one day old cheese and their percentage was gradually decreasing, whereas the number of lactobacilli was increasing. After 30 days of cheese ripening the number of cocci increased again, reaching the number of lactobacilli. The results of API 50 CH system and rep-PCR analysis showed that Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Enterococcuus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were the main groups present during the ripening of Zlatar cheese. Results revealed that in older cheeses (45 and 60 days old) enterococci were the main group present. It was also demonstrated that 57 isolates showed antimicrobial activity. The number of bacteria showing antimicrobial activity slowly decreased during the ripening period and in samples of 60 days old cheese producers of antimicrobial activities were not detected.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Genetic variation in Drosophila melanogaster resistance to infection: a comparison across bacteria.
AB  - Insects use a generalized immune response to combat bacterial infection. We have  previously noted that natural populations of D. melanogaster harbor substantial genetic variation for antibacterial immunocompetence and that much of this variation can be mapped to genes that are known to play direct roles in immunity. It was not known, however, whether the phenotypic effects of variation in these genes are general across the range of potentially infectious bacteria. To address this question, we have reinfected the same set of D. melanogaster lines with Serratia marcescens, the bacterium used in the previous study, and with three additional bacteria that were isolated from the hemolymph of wild-caught D. melanogaster. Two of the new bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis, are gram positive. The third, Providencia burhodogranaria, is gram negative like S. marcescens. Drosophila genotypes vary highly significantly in bacterial load sustained after infection with each of the four bacteria, but mean loads are largely uncorrelated across bacteria. We have tested statistical associations between immunity phenotypes and nucleotide polymorphism in 21 candidate immunity genes. We find that molecular variation in some genes, such as Tehao, contributes to phenotypic variation in the suppression of only a subset of the pathogens. Variation in SR-CII and 18-wheeler, however, has effects that are more general. Although markers in SR-CII and 18-wheeler explain >20% of the phenotypic variation in resistance to L. lactis and E. faecalis, respectively, most of the molecular polymorphisms tested explain <10% of the total variance in bacterial load sustained after infection.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Artisanal and experimental Pecorino Siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and PCR-DGGE analyses.
AB  - Traditional artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheeses, and two experimental PS cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. The bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene to that of reference species. The culture-independent fingerprinting technique PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of samples taken during artisanal PS cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. The dominance of Streptococcus bovis and Lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal PS was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of DGGE profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental PS cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. Nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional PS cheese.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Phenotypic identification and technological properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditionally processed fish products of the Eastern Himalayas.
AB  - Sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti are traditional smoked and sun-dried fish products of the Eastern Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. A total of 40 samples of sukako maacha (14), gnuchi (6), sidra (10) and sukuti (10) were collected and were analysed for microbial load. Population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as well as aerobic mesophilic counts ranged from 4.7-8.3 to 5.1-8.5 log cfu g(-1), respectively. A total of 189 strains of LAB were isolated from sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti samples, out of which 171 strains were cocci and 15 strains, were heterofermentative lactobacilli. LAB were identified on the basis of phenotypic characters including API system as Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weissella confusa. LAB strains produced a wide spectrum of enzymes. Some strains of LAB showed antagonistic properties against pathogenic strains. None of the strains produced biogenic amines in the method applied. This paper is the first report on the microbial composition, mostly lactic acid bacteria, of traditionally processed fish products of Eastern Himalayas.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - The N-terminal domain of enterococcal surface protein, Esp, is sufficient for Esp-mediated biofilm enhancement in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococci have emerged as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream,  surgical site, and urinary tract infections. More recently, enterococci have been associated with biofilms, which are bacterial communities attached to a surface and encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix. The enterococcal cell surface-associated protein, Esp, enhances biofilm formation by Enterococcus faecalis in a glucose-dependent manner. Mature Esp consists of a nonrepeat N-terminal domain and a central region made up of two types of tandem repeats followed by a C-terminal membrane-spanning and anchor domain. This study was undertaken to localize the specific domain(s) of Esp that plays a role in Esp-mediated biofilm enhancement. To achieve this objective, we constructed in-frame deletion mutants expressing truncated forms of Esp in an isogenic background. By comparing strains expressing the mutant forms of Esp to those expressing wild-type Esp, we found that the strain expressing Esp lacking the N-terminal domain formed biofilms that were quantitatively less in biovolume than the strain expressing wild-type Esp. Furthermore, an E. faecalis strain expressing only the N-terminal domain of Esp fused to a heterologous protein anchor formed biofilms that were quantitatively similar to those formed by a strain expressing full-length Esp. This suggested that the minimal region contributing to Esp-mediated biofilm enhancement in E. faecalis was confined to the nonrepeat N-terminal domain. Expression of full-length E. faecalis Esp in heterologous host systems of esp-deficient Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecium did not enhance biofilm formation as was observed for E. faecalis. These results suggest that Esp may require interaction with an additional E. faecalis-specific factor(s) to result in biofilm enhancement.
TI  - Combined effect of high-pressure treatments and bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria on inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw-milk cheese.
AB  - The effect of high-pressure (HP) treatments combined with bacteriocins of lactic  acid bacteria (LAB) produced in situ on the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cheese was investigated. Cheeses were manufactured from raw milk inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 at approximately 10(5) CFU/ml. Seven different bacteriocin-producing LAB were added at approximately 10(6) CFU/ml as adjuncts to the starter. Cheeses were pressurized on day 2 or 50 at 300 MPa for 10 min or 500 MPa for 5 min, at 10 degrees C in both cases. After 60 days, E. coli O157:H7 counts in cheeses manufactured without bacteriocin-producing LAB and not pressurized were 5.1 log CFU/g. A higher inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 was achieved in cheeses without bacteriocin-producing LAB when 300 MPa was applied on day 50 (3.8-log-unit reduction) than if applied on day 2 (1.3-log-unit reduction). Application of 500 MPa eliminated E. coli O157:H7 in 60-day-old cheeses. Cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing LAB and not pressurized showed a slight reduction of the pathogen. Pressurization at 300 MPa on day 2 and addition of lacticin 481-, nisin A-, bacteriocin TAB 57-, or enterocin AS-48-producing LAB were synergistic and reduced E. coli O157:H7 counts to levels below 2 log units in 60-day-old cheeses. Pressurization at 300 MPa on day 50 and addition of nisin A-, bacteriocin TAB 57-, enterocin I-, or enterocin AS-48-producing LAB completely inactivated E. coli O157:H7 in 60-day-old cheeses. The application of reduced pressures combined with bacteriocin-producing LAB is a feasible procedure to improve cheese safety.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Microarray-based detection of 90 antibiotic resistance genes of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A disposable microarray was developed for detection of up to 90 antibiotic resistance genes in gram-positive bacteria by hybridization. Each antibiotic resistance gene is represented by two specific oligonucleotides chosen from consensus sequences of gene families, except for nine genes for which only one specific oligonucleotide could be developed. A total of 137 oligonucleotides (26 to 33 nucleotides in length with similar physicochemical parameters) were spotted onto the microarray. The microarrays (ArrayTubes) were hybridized with 36 strains carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes that allowed testing of the sensitivity and specificity of 125 oligonucleotides. Among these were well-characterized multidrug-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactococcus lactis and an avirulent strain of Bacillus anthracis harboring the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pRE25. Analysis of two multidrug-resistant field strains allowed the detection of 12 different antibiotic resistance genes in a Staphylococcus haemolyticus strain isolated from mastitis milk and 6 resistance genes in a Clostridium perfringens strain isolated from a calf. In both cases, the microarray genotyping corresponded to the phenotype of the strains. The ArrayTube platform presents the advantage of rapidly screening bacteria for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes known in gram-positive bacteria. This technology has a large potential for applications in basic research, food safety, and surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Homofermentative lactic acid bacteria of a traditional cheese, Comlek peyniri from Cappadocia region.
AB  - Comlek peyniri is a typical artisanal cheese in Central Anatolia. This type of cheese was made by using the indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora of cow or ewes' milk. Majority of the samples were taken from fresh cheese because the aim was to isolate homofermentative LAB. Initially 661 microbial isolates were obtained from 17 cheese samples. Only 107 were found to be homofermentative LAB. These isolates were selected and identified by using both phenotypic and molecular methods. Phenotypic identification included curd formation from skim milk, catalase test, Gram staining and light microscopy, growth at different temperatures and salt concentrations, arginine hydrolysis, gas production from glucose, and carbohydrate fermentation. Molecular identification was based on the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene-ITS (internally transcribed spacer) region. By combining the phenotypic and molecular identification results, isolates belonging to each of the following genera were determined at species or subspecies level: 54 Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 21 Enterococcus faecium, 3 Ec. faecalis, 2 Ec. durans, 10 Ec. sp., 15 Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and 2 Lb. casei strains. Technological characterisation was also performed by culturing each of the strains in UHT skim milk, and by monitoring pH change and lactic acid production at certain time intervals through the 24 h incubation. Results of the technological characterisation indicated that 33% of the isolates (35 strains) were capable of lowering the pH of UHT milk below 5.3 after 6 h incubation at 30 degrees C. Thirty four of these strains were Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, and only one was an Ec. faecium strain.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the Lactococcus lactis chromosomal sex factor promotes dissemination of the Ll.LtrB group II intron.
AB  - The Ll.LtrB group II intron from the low-G+C gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus  lactis was the first bacterial group II intron shown to splice and mobilize in vivo. This retroelement interrupts the relaxase gene (ltrB) of three L. lactis conjugative elements: plasmids pRS01 and pAH90 and the chromosomal sex factor. Conjugative transfer of a plasmid harboring a segment of the pRS01 conjugative plasmid including the Ll.LtrB intron allows dissemination of Ll.LtrB among L. lactis strains and lateral transfer of this retroelement from L. lactis to Enterococcus faecalis. Here we report the dissemination of the Ll.LtrB group II intron among L. lactis strains following conjugative transfer of the native chromosomally embedded L. lactis sex factor. We demonstrated that Ll.LtrB dissemination is highly variable and often more efficient from this integrative and conjugative element than from an engineered conjugative plasmid. Cotransfer among L. lactis strains of both Ll.LtrB-containing elements, the conjugative plasmid and the sex factor, was detected and shown to be synergistic. Moreover, following their concurrent transfer, both mobilizable elements supported the spread of their respective copies of the Ll.LtrB intron. Our findings explain the unusually high efficiency of Ll.LtrB mobility observed following conjugation of intron-containing plasmids.
TI  - Differences in the Enterococcus faecalis lsa locus that influence susceptibility  to quinupristin-dalfopristin and clindamycin.
AB  - We have previously shown that the Enterococcus faecalis lsa gene, encoding the putative ABC protein Lsa, influences resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) and clindamycin (CLI). We have now found that, while cloned lsa from E. faecalis strain V583 (lsa(V)) fully restored resistance to Q-D, CLI, and dalfopristin (DAL) lost by the OG1 lsa disruption mutant TX5332 and also caused increased MICs for Lactococcus lactis LM2301, cloned lsa from OG1 (lsa(OG)) did not cause any increase in MICs for either species. Sequencing of ca. 2 kb of these two lsa alleles found differences between lsa(OG) and lsa(V) in the upstream region as well as in the 5' and 3' halves of the lsa gene. To investigate the reason for the phenotypic differences expressed by the two cloned loci, 5' half plus 3' half hybrid constructs were created. When introduced into both TX5332 and L. lactis, cloned lsa(V5)(')(OG3)(') conferred increases in MICs of Q-D, CLI, and DAL similar to those of cloned lsa(V) while cloned lsa(OG5)(')(V3)(') showed a moderate increase in MICs relative to those of lsa(OG), indicating that both halves of the locus can influence resistance expression. After site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned lsa alleles at positions -131 and -133 (relative to the putative Lsa start codon ATG), which converted two A's of lsa(V) to the G and T of lsa(OG) and vice versa, MIC testing showed that mutagenized lsa(OG) (lsa(OG-M)) was strongly influenced by these changes in terms of conferring increased MICs of Q-D, CLI, and DAL relative to lsa(OG) while the phenotype of mutagenized lsa(V) (lsa(V-M)) was less influenced, with moderately decreased MICs, primarily to CLI, relative to lsa(V). In conclusion, this study found that changes in different regions of the E. faecalis lsa locus influence the ability of cloned lsa to confer resistance to Q-D, CLI, and DAL.
TI  - Worst-case scenarios for horizontal gene transfer from Lactococcus lactis carrying heterologous genes to Enterococcus faecalis in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Since genetically modified (GM) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) might be released in open environments for future nutritional and medical applications, the purpose of this study was to determine an upper limit for the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the digestive tract (DT) from Lactococcus lactis carrying heterologous genes (lux genes encoding a bacterial luciferase) to Enterococcus faecalis. Two enterococcal wide host-range conjugative model systems were used: (i) a system composed of a mobilizable plasmid containing the heterologous lux genes and a native conjugative helper plasmid; and (ii) a Tn916-lux transposon. Both systems were tested under the most transfer-prone conditions, i.e. germfree mice mono-associated with the recipient E. faecalis. No transfer was observed with the transposon system. Transfers of the mobilizable plasmid carrying heterologous genes were below 10(2) transconjugants per g of faeces for a single donor dose and reached between 10(3) and 10(4) transconjugants per g of faeces when continuous inoculation of the donor strain was used. Once established in mice, transconjugants persisted at low levels in the mouse DT.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Antilisterial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from rigouta, a traditional Tunisian cheese.
AB  - AIMS: Screening for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) producing bacteriocins and other antimicrobial compounds is of a great significance for the dairy industry to improve food safety. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six-hundred strains of LAB isolated from 'rigouta', a Tunisian fermented cheese, were tested for antilisterial activity. Eight bacteriocinogenic strains were selected and analysed. Seven of these strains were identified as Lactococcus lactis and produced nisin Z as demonstrated by mass spectrometry analysis of the purified antibacterial compound. Polymerase chain reaction experiments using nisin gene-specific primers confirmed the presence of nisin operon. Plasmid profiles analysis suggests the presence of, at least, three different strains in this group. MMT05, the eighth strain of this antilisterial collection was identified, at molecular level, as Enterococcus faecalis. The purified bacteriocin produced by this strain showed a molecular mass of 10 201.33 +/- 0.85 Da. This new member of class III bacteriocins was termed enterocin MMT05. CONCLUSIONS: Seven lactococcal strains producing nisin Z were selected and could be useful as bio-preservative starter cultures. Additional experiments are needed to evaluate the promising strain MMT05 as bio-preservative as Enterococci could exert detrimental or beneficial role in foods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Only a few antibacterial strains isolated from traditional African dairy products were described. The new eight strains described herein contribute to the knowledge of this poorly studied environment and constitute promising strains for fermented food safety.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Controlled autolysis and enzyme release in a recombinant lactococcal strain expressing the metalloendopeptidase enterolysin A.
AB  - This study concerns the exploitation of the lytic enzyme enterolysin A (EntL), produced by Enterococcus faecalis strain DPC5280, to elicit the controlled autolysis of starter lactococci. EntL, a cell wall metalloendopeptidase secreted by some E. faecalis strains, can kill a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including lactococci. The controlled expression of entL, which encodes EntL, was achieved using a nisin-inducible expression system in a lactococcal host. Zymographic analysis of EntL activity demonstrated that active enzyme is produced by the recombinant lactococcal host. Indeed, expression of EntL resulted in almost complete autolysis of the host strain 2 h after induction with nisin. Model cheese experiments using a starter strain in addition to the inducible enterolysin-producing strain showed a 27-fold increase in activity with respect to the release of lactate dehydrogenase in the strain overexpressing EntL, demonstrating the potential of EntL production in large-scale cheese production systems. Indeed, the observation that a wide range of lactic bacteria are sensitive to EntL suggests that EntL-induced autolysis has potential applications with a variety of lactic acid bacteria and could be a basis for probiotic delivery systems.
TI  - Conjugation mediates transfer of the Ll.LtrB group II intron between different bacterial species.
AB  - Some self-splicing group II introns (ribozymes) are mobile retroelements. These retroelements, which can insert themselves into cognate intronless alleles or ectopic sites by reverse splicing, are thought to be the evolutionary progenitors of the widely distributed eukaryotic spliceosomal introns. Lateral or horizontal transmission of introns (i.e. between species), although never experimentally demonstrated, is a well-accepted model for intron dispersal and evolution. Horizontal transfer of the ancestral bacterial group II introns may have contributed to the dispersal and wide distribution of spliceosomal introns present in modern eukaryotic genomes. Here, the Ll.LtrB group II intron from the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis was used as a model system to address the dissemination of introns in the bacterial kingdom. We report the first experimental demonstration of horizontal transfer of a group II intron. We show that the Ll.LtrB group II intron, originally discovered on an L. lactis conjugative plasmid (pRS01) and within a chromosomally located sex factor in L. lactis 712, invades new sites using both retrohoming and retrotransposition pathways after its transfer by conjugation. Ll.LtrB lateral transfer is shown among different L. lactis strains (intraspecies) (retrohoming and retrotransposition) and between L. lactis and Enterococcus faecalis (interspecies) (retrohoming). These results shed light on long-standing questions about intron evolution and propagation, and demonstrate that conjugation is one of the mechanisms by which group II introns are, and probably were, broadly disseminated between widely diverged organisms.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic diversity of Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus spp. strains isolated from Northern Spain starter-free farmhouse cheeses.
AB  - To evaluate a previous phenotypic classification of lactococci, 39 presumed lactococcal strains were classified by molecular techniques. The strains were also subjected to several typing techniques to estimate the phenotypic and genetic diversity present in original populations from starter-free farmhouse cheeses. Partial Amplified rDNA Restriction Analysis (partial ARDRA) with either restriction enzyme MboII or HhaI divided these isolates into four distinctive groups. Sequencing of representative amplicons identified 29 isolates as belonging to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (24) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris (5). The remaining 10 isolates were shown to be Enterococcus durans (8) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), which were misclassified by the traditional tests. Thus, partial ARDRA was successfully used to classify wild Lactococcus-like strains into Lactococcus and Enterococcus species. The technique also allowed differentiation of L. lactis strains at subspecies level. The 29 strains of L. lactis showed five different fermentation profiles, four distinct Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles, and 14 unrelated profiles by both Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analyzed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (RFLP-PFGE) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Using the same techniques, the 10 enterococcal strains showed four fermentation profiles, four RADP, and six by RFLP-PFGE and SDS-PAGE, respectively. Several typing techniques, especially RFLP-PFGE and SDS-PAGE, revealed wide phenotypic and genetic variability in both the lactococcal and enterococcal isolates. Two simple, rapid and cheap techniques (partial ARDRA and SDS-PAGE) are proposed as reliable tools for the classification and typing of new lactococcal-like isolates.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - The screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (pH 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees C under aeration. Among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm H2O2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm H2O2 in the cell suspensions. Among the 9 high-level H2O2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The cell-free filtrate from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis AI 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm H2O2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria ivanovii, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Aeromonas hydrophila. After 1 h incubation at 30 degrees C in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/mL) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. The sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and pH. The enterococci were resistant to the treatment. Our results show that H2O2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - Functional analysis of the gene cluster involved in production of the bacteriocin circularin A by Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752.
AB  - A region of 12 kb flanking the structural gene of the cyclic antibacterial peptide circularin A of Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752 was sequenced, and the putative proteins involved in the production and secretion of circularin A were identified. The genes are tightly organized in overlapping open reading frames. Heterologous expression of circularin A in Enterococcus faecalis was achieved, and five genes were identified as minimally required for bacteriocin production and secretion. Two of the putative proteins, CirB and CirC, are predicted to contain membrane-spanning domains, while CirD contains a highly conserved ATP-binding domain. Together with CirB and CirC, this ATP-binding protein is involved in the production of circularin A. The fifth gene, cirE, confers immunity towards circularin A when expressed in either Lactococcus lactis or E. faecalis and is needed in order to allow the bacteria to produce bacteriocin. Additional resistance against circularin A is conferred by the activity of the putative transporter consisting of CirB and CirD.
TI  - In vitro conjugal transfer of tetracycline resistance from Lactobacillus isolates to other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ability of 14 Lactobacillus strains, isolated from fermented dry sausages, to transfer tetracycline resistance encoded by tet(M) through conjugation was examined using filter mating experiments. Seven out of 14 tetracycline-resistant Lactobacillus isolates were able to transfer in vitro this resistance to Enterococcus faecalis at frequencies ranging from 10(-4) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Two of these strains could also transfer their resistance to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, whereas no conjugal transfer to a Staphylococcus aureus recipient was found. These data suggest that meat lactobacilli might be reservoir organisms for acquired resistance genes that can be spread to other lactic acid bacteria. In order to assess the risk of this potential hazard, the magnitude of transfer along the food chain merits further research.
TI  - Pediocin production by recombinant lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Production of the anti-listerial bacteriocin, pediocin, by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformed with the cloning vector pPC418 (Ped+, 9.1 kb) was influenced by composition of media and incubation temperature. Maximum pediocin production, tested against Listeria innocua, by electrotransformants of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis was measured in tryptone/lactose/yeast extract medium after 24 h growth at 30 degrees C, while incubation at 40 degrees C was optimum for Ped+ transformants of Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis. The amount of pediocin produced by S. thermophilus in skim milk and cheese whey supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract was estimated as 51,000 units ml(-1) and 25,000 units ml(-1), respectively. Pediocin production remained essentially unchanged in reconstituted skim milk or whey media diluted up to 10-fold. The results demonstrate the capacity of recombinant strains of LAB to produce pediocin in a variety of growth media including skim milk and inexpensive cheese whey-based media, requiring minimum nutritional supplementation.
TI  - Bacterial community structure and location in Stilton cheese.
AB  - The microbial diversity occurring in Stilton cheese was evaluated by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. DNA templates for PCR experiments were directly extracted from the cheese as well as bulk cells harvested from a variety of viable-count media. The variable V3 and V4-V5 regions of the 16S genes were analyzed. Closest relatives of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus equorum, and Staphylococcus sp. were identified by sequencing of the DGGE fragments. Fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes were developed to detect Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments, and their specificity for the species occurring in the community of Stilton cheese was checked in FISH experiments carried out with reference cultures. The combined use of these probes and the bacterial probe Eub338 in FISH experiments on Stilton cheese sections allowed the assessment of the spatial distribution of the different microbial species in the dairy matrix. Microbial colonies of bacteria showed a differential location in the different parts of the cheese examined: the core, the veins, and the crust. Lactococci were found in the internal part of the veins as mixed colonies and as single colonies within the core. Lactobacillus plantarum was detected only underneath the surface, while Leuconostoc microcolonies were homogeneously distributed in all parts observed. The combined molecular approach is shown to be useful to simultaneously describe the structure and location of the bacterial flora in cheese. The differential distribution of species found suggests specific ecological reasons for the establishment of sites of actual microbial growth in the cheese, with implications of significance in understanding the ecology of food systems and with the aim of achieving optimization of the fermentation technologies as well as preservation of traditional products.
TI  - Construction of the mobilizable plasmid pMV158GFP, a derivative of pMV158 that carries the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein.
AB  - Plasmid pMV158 has been employed to construct cloning non-mobilizable vectors for various Gram-positive organisms. Here we report the construction of a mobilizable pMV158-based plasmid that harbors the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein under the control of a promoter inducible by maltose. The plasmid was mobilized between strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as from S. pneumoniae to Lactococcus lactis or Enterococcus faecalis at the same frequency as its parental. Transconjugant that received the GFP-tagged plasmid could be detected by their fluorescence, which was especially high in E. faecalis cells.
TI  - Cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  - The C-terminal region (cA) of the major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (LysM domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. The cA domain could be deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. This AcmA derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete. The cA domain and a chimeric protein consisting of cA fused to the C terminus of MSA2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via cA. The fusion protein also bound to many other Gram-positive bacteria. By chemical treatment of purified cell walls of L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with cA. Immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, B. subtilis, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus casei cells. Based on these studies, we propose that LysM-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of AcmA. Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed.
TI  - The genes coding for enterocin EJ97 production by Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 are  located on a conjugative plasmid.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 produces a cationic bacteriocin (enterocin EJ97) of low molecular mass (5,327.7 Da). The complete amino acid sequence of enterocin EJ97 was elucidated after automated microsequencing of oligopeptides generated by endoproteinase GluC digestion and cyanogen bromide treatment. Transfer of the 60-kb conjugative plasmid pEJ97 from the bacteriocinogenic strain E. faecalis EJ97 to E. faecalis OG1X conferred bacteriocin production and resistance on the recipient. The genetic determinants of enterocin EJ97 were located in an 11.3-kb EcoRI-BglII DNA fragment of pEJ97. This region was cloned and sequenced. It contains the ej97A structural gene plus three open reading frames (ORFs) (ej97B, ej97C, and ej97D) and three putative ORFs transcribed in the opposite direction (orfA, orfB, and orfC). The gene ej97A translated as a 44-amino-acid residue mature protein lacking a leader peptide with no homology to other bacteriocins described so far. The product of ej97B (Ej97B) shows strong homology in its C-terminal domain to the superfamily of bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters. The products of ej97C (Ej97C) and ej97D (Ej97D) could be proteins with 71 and 64 residues, respectively, of unknown functions and with no significant similarity to known proteins. There are two additional ORFs (ORF1 and ORF6) flanking the ej97 module, which have been identified as a transposon-like structure (tnp). ORF1 shows similarities to transposase of the Lactococcus lactis element ISS1 and is up to 50% identical to IS1216. This is flanked by two 18-bp inverted repeats (IRs) that are almost identical to those of ISS1 and IS1216. ORF6 (resEJ97) shows strong homology to the resolvase of plasmid pAM373 and up to 40 to 50% homology with the recombinase of several multiresistant plasmids and transposons from Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis. These data suggest that EJ97 could represent a new class of bacteriocins with a novel secretion mechanism and that the whole structure could be a composite transposon. Furthermore, two additional gene clusters were found: one cluster is probably related to the region responsible for the replication of plasmid pEJ97, and the second cluster is related to the sex pheromone response. These regions showed a high homology to the corresponding regions of the conjugative plasmids pAM373, pPD1, and pAD1 of E. faecalis, suggesting that they have a common origin.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with paddy rice silage  as determined by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis.
AB  - A total of 161 low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. Based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (LAB) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and WEISSELLA: Analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was used to confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. The virtually complete 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified and sequenced. The sequences from the various LAB isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the GenBank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). Phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rDNA sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. With the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. The prevalent LAB, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of Lactobacillus plantarum (24%), Lactococcus lactis (22%), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), Pediococcus acidilactici (11%), Lactobacillus brevis (11%), Enterococcus faecalis (7%), Weissella kimchii (3%), and Pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). The present study, the first to fully document rice-associated LAB, showed a very diverse community of LAB with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. The comprehensive 16S rDNA-based approach to describing LAB community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.
TI  - Esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  - In the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. Esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. The lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. By studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. Lactobacillus plantarum O236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. Lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. The intracellular and extracellular fractions of Leuconostoc mesenteroides O257, Lactobacillus plantarum O236, and Lactobacillus acidophilus O177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. L. plantarum O186, L. acidophilus O252, Enterococcus faecium O174 and O426, and Enterococcus faecalis Ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. Lactococcus lactis O233, L. plantarum O155, and Lactobacillus casei O190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. Not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. Esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. Wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.
TI  - The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in PmpA, the PrsA-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The prsA-like gene from Lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to PrsA, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in Bacillus subtilis, was characterized. This gene, annotated pmpA, encodes a lipoprotein of 309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. A slight increase in the expression of the PrsA-like protein (PLP) in L. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the Staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. This shows that PmpA either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease HtrA. Unlike the case for B. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding PmpA reduced only slightly the growth rate of L. lactis in standard conditions. However, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. Like PrsA of B. subtilis and PrtM of L. lactis, the L. lactis PmpA protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. These proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (PPIases) for which parvulin is the prototype. Almost all PLP from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the PPIase signature. An exception to this situation was found only in Streptococcaceae, the family to which L. lactis belongs. PLP from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of L. lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus mutans do not. However, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of PLP is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. The activity associated with the expression of PmpA in L. lactis and these genomic data show that either the PPIase motif is not necessary for PPIase activity or, more likely, PmpA foldase activity does not necessarily require PPIase activity.
TI  - [Comparison of the homologous SfeI and LlaBI restriction-modification systems].
AB  - A fragment containing the SfeI restriction-modification system (RMS) operon was cloned from a Streptococcus faecalis SE72 plasmid. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed its high (99.2%) homology to the operon for Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W56 LlaBI RMS recognizing the same site, 5'-CTRYAG-3'. A substantial difference was that SfeI RMS operon had an additional 198-bp fragment and a larger gene for the putative control protein. No homology was observed between operon-flanking sequences of the two closely related species, suggesting horizontal transfer of the operon.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - An in vitro assay to evaluate competitive exclusion products for poultry.
AB  - An in vitro assay was developed to measure the ability of competitive exclusion (CE) bacteria to protect Caco-2 and CRL-2117 epithelial cells from invasion by Salmonella Typhimurium. The proposed assay is needed to expedite the development of defined-flora CE products. The average significantly protective concentration of the commercial poultry-specific CE product Preempt was 4.05 log CFU/6.41 log human Caco-2 cells and 3.71 log CFU/6.89 log CFU chicken CRL-2117 cells, Enterococcus faecalis isolated from Preempt protected CRL-2117 cells, Escherichia coli isolates protected Caco-2 cells, Lactococcus lactis and Bacteroides distasonis isolates protected both cell lines, and three species of Lactobacillus isolates failed to protect either cell line. A defined mixture of 29 strains of bacteria similar to the constituents of Preempt protected both cell lines from Salmonella invasion at a concentration of 7.83 log CFU. The constituents of the defined CE culture were separated into mixtures of obligate (8.42 log CFU) and facultative (8.49 log CFU) anaerobes, which both protected the cell lines, suggesting that both types of bacteria were equally protective. Although not a substitute for in vivo testing, the in vitro CE assay is a rapid technique for the evaluation of bacterial mixtures for potential CE products.
TI  - An Enterococcus faecalis ABC homologue (Lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (CLI) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. Disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance") of E. faecalis was associated with a > or =40-fold decrease in MICs of Q-D (to 0.75 microg/ml), CLI (to 0.12 to 0.5 microg/ml), and dalfopristin (DAL) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type E. faecalis parental strain (Q-D MIC, 32 microg/ml; CLI MIC, 32 to 48 microg/ml; DAL MIC, 512 microg/ml). Complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the MICs of CLI, Q-D, and DAL to wild-type levels. Under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of E. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. Among 19 erm(B)-lacking Enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to CLI (MIC, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had DAL MICs of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the remaining erm(B)-lacking E. faecium strains, the CLI and DAL MICs were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, none of 32 erm(B)-lacking E. faecalis strains were susceptible (CLI MIC range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; DAL MIC range, > or =32 microg/ml). When lsa was introduced into an E. faecium strain initially susceptible to CLI, the MICs of CLI and DAL increased > or =60-fold and that of Q-D increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). Introduction of lsa into two DAL-resistant (MICs, > 128 microg/ml), Q-D-susceptible (MICs, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) E. faecium strains (CLI MICs, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the Q-D MICs from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. Although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the predicted Lsa protein to ABC proteins such as Vga(A), Vga(B), and Msr(A) of Staphylococcus aureus and YjcA of Lactococcus lactis and the presence of Walker A and B ATP-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. In conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of E. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to CLI and Q-D.
TI  - Beta-glucose 1-phosphate-interconverting enzymes in maltose- and trehalose-fermenting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Maltose and trehalose catabolic pathways are linked through their common enzyme,  beta-phosphoglucomutase, and metabolite, beta-glucose 1-phosphate, in Lactococcus lactis. Maltose is degraded by the concerted action of maltose phosphorylase and beta-phosphoglucomutase, whereas trehalose is assimilated by a novel pathway, including the recently discovered enzyme, trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase, and beta-phosphoglucomutase. In the present study, 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria were investigated for utilization of metabolic reactions involving beta-glucose 1-phosphate. All genera of the low G+C content lactic acid bacteria belonging to the clostridial subbranch of Gram-positive bacteria were represented in the study. The strains, which fermented maltose or trehalose, were investigated for beta-phosphoglucomutase, maltose phosphorylase and trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase activity, as indications of maltose and trehalose catabolic pathways involving beta-glucose 1-phosphate interconversions. Eighty per cent of all strains fermented maltose and, of these strains, 63% were shown to use a maltose phosphorylase/beta- phosphoglucomutase pathway. One-third of the strains fermenting trehalose were found to harbour trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase activity, and these were also shown to possess beta-phosphoglucomutase activity. Mainly L. lactis and Enterococcus faecalis strains were found to harbour the novel trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase/beta-phosphoglucomutase pathway. As lower beta-glucose 1-phosphate interconverting enzyme activities were observed in the majority of glucose-cultivated lactic acid bacteria, glucose was suggested to repress the synthesis of these enzymes in most strains. Thus, metabolic reactions involving the beta-anomer of glucose 1-phosphate are frequently found in both maltose- and trehalose-utilizing lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - The potential of a polyphasic PCR-dGGE approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production: bias of culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  - A polyphasic PCR-DGGE approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (NWCs) for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production. Total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing DNA directly extracted from the original samples of NWC. In addition, DNA extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. The 16S rDNA V3 region was amplified using DNA from NWC as well as DNA from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by DGGE. The microbial entities occurring in NWCs were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing of DGGE bands: four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) closest relative of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of DNA directly extracted from NWC while two other LAB, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified by analyzing DNA from the cultivable community. The developed PCR-DGGE analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from NWC and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. Moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
TI  - Two forms of NAD-dependent D-mandelate dehydrogenase in Enterococcus faecalis IAM 10071.
AB  - Two forms of NAD-dependent D-mandelate dehydrogenase (D-ManDHs) were purified from Enterococcus faecalis IAM 10071. While these two enzymes consistently exhibited high activity toward large 2-ketoacid substrates that were branched at the C3 or C4 position, they gave distinctly different K(m) and V(max) values for these substrates and had distinct molecular weights by gel electrophoresis and gel filtration.
TI  - Characterization of genes homologous to the general stress-inducible gene gls24 in Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Three genes (Ef0604, ymgG, and ytgH) were identified as homologous to the gls24 gene (encoding the general stress protein Gls24) in Enterococcus faecalis V583 and Lactococcus lactis IL1403 genomes sequences, and therefore are part of the 'gls24 family'. The other proteins encoded by the different surrounding genes in each of their respective operons are also highly similar. Our transcriptional analysis showed that Ef0604 and ymgG are not induced under the stress conditions tested. On the other hand, ytgH is induced at the onset of glucose starvation and by heat, ethanolic, osmotic, and CdCl(2) stresses. The transcriptional start site of this operon was identified and the promoter region appears to contain an 'extended -10 Box'. Moreover, the over-expression under several stress conditions of the YtgH protein observed on 2D gel electrophoresis confirms that it corresponds to a general stress protein in L. lactis.
TI  - ccfA, the genetic determinant for the cCF10 peptide pheromone in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF.
AB  - The nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecalis has a unique pheromone-inducible conjugative mating system. Conjugative transfer of the E. faecalis plasmid pCF10 is specifically induced by the cCF10 peptide pheromone (LVTLVFV). Genomic sequence information has recently allowed the identification of putative structural genes coding for the various enterococcal pheromones (D. B. Clewell et al., Mol. Microbiol. 35:246-247, 2000). The cCF10 pheromone sequence LVTLVFV was found within an open reading frame designated ccfA, encoding a putative lipoprotein precursor. Several other pheromone sequences were found in similar locations within other predicted lipoproteins. CcfA shows significant sequence relatedness to the Escherichia coli protein YidC, an inner membrane protein translocase, as well as to a large number of homologs identified in gram-positive and in gram-negative bacteria. Analysis of the deduced CcfA amino acid sequence suggested that mature cCF10 peptide could be formed from the proteolytic degradation of its signal peptide. Expression of the cloned ccfA gene with an inducible expression vector dramatically increased cCF10 production by E. faecalis and also resulted in cCF10 production by Lactococcus lactis, a non-pheromone producer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the ccfA sequence encoding the cCF10 peptide confirmed that ccfA was a functional genetic determinant for cCF10.
TI  - Sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25.
AB  - The complete 50,237-bp DNA sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25 was determined. The plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23S RNA methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pIP501. Genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in Tn5405 from Staphylococcus aureus and in pJH1 from E. faecalis. One interrupted and five complete IS elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pRE25 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pIP501. It is concluded that pRE25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.
TI  - Characterization of anti-Listeria monocytogenes bacteriocins from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from Raib, a Moroccan traditional fermented milk.
AB  - Seventy-four samples of raib, a Moroccan traditional fermented milk, were screened for their anti-Listeria monocytogenes activity. Nine lactic acid bacteria with antilisterial activity were isolated and identified as Lactococcus lactis [4], Enterococcus faecium [4], and E. faecalis [1]. Antibacterial spectra, determined against 45 target strains, led to the selection of four antibacterial-producing strains, which were further characterized. Their anti-microbial agents, inactivated by one or more proteases, were designed as bacteriocins. Lactococcin R9/2 and R10/1 showed the broadest range of inhibitory action. Anti-bacterial spectra and physico-chemical properties suggest that these bacteriocins were similar to nisin. Enterocin R69 had a specificity of action against Listeria spp., whereas Enterocin R18 had a broad spectrum of activity. Lc. lactis R9/2 and E. faecalis R18 were able to coagulate sterilised UHT milk at 30 degrees C in 24 h and induced a 2 log reduction in L. monocytogenes ATCC 15313 population.
TI  - Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase is part of a novel metabolic pathway for trehalose utilization in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis splits phosphorylated trehalose by the action of inorganic phosphate-dependent trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase (TrePP) in a novel catabolic pathway. TrePP was found to catalyze the reversible conversion of trehalose 6-phosphate into beta-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate by measuring intermediate sugar phosphates in cell extracts from trehalose-cultivated lactococci. According to native PAGE and SDS-PAGE, TrePP was shown to be a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 94 kDa. Reaction kinetics suggested that the enzyme follows a ternary complex mechanism with optimal phosphorolysis at 35 degrees C and pH 6.3. The equilibrium constants were found to be 0.026 and 0.032 at pH 6.3 and 7.0, respectively, favoring the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate. The Michaelis-Menten constants of TrePP for trehalose 6-phosphate, inorganic phosphate, beta-glucose 1-phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate were determined to be 6, 32, 0.9, and 4 mm, respectively. The TrePP-encoding gene, designated trePP, was localized in a putative trehalose operon of L. lactis. This operon includes the gene encoding beta-phosphoglucomutase in addition to three open reading frames believed to encode a transcriptional regulator and two trehalose-specific phosphotransferase system components. The identity of trePP was confirmed by determining the N-terminal amino acid sequence of TrePP and by its overexpression in Escherichia coli and L. lactis, as well as the construction of a lactococcal trePP knockout mutant. Furthermore, both TrePP and beta-phosphoglucomutase activity were detected in Enterococcus faecalis cell extract, indicating that this bacterium exhibits the same trehalose assimilation route as L. lactis.
TI  - Determination of Enterococcus faecalis groESL full-length sequence and application for species identification.
AB  - Amplification of the partial Cpn60 (or GroEL) gene segment has been used for identification of many bacteria, including Enterococcus species. To obtain more sequence data from groESL genes of Enterococcus faecalis, the full-length sequence of the E. faecalis groESL genes containing groES (285 bp), spacer (57 bp), and groEL (1,626 bp) was determined. A database search of GenBank revealed that the deduced E. faecalis GroES and GroEL proteins show significant homology to the GroES and GroEL proteins of other bacteria. The GroEL (groEL) of E. faecalis had the highest identity with Streptococcus pneumoniae (81.8% amino acid sequence identity and 73.0% nucleotide sequence identity), followed by Lactococcus zeae, while GroES (groES) had 60.2% (64.6%) identity with Lactobacillus zeae and 58.5% (66.2%) identity with Lactococcus lactis, followed by 57.0% (65.5%) identity with Bacillus subtilis. Based on the groES sequence, an E. faecalis-specific PCR assay was developed, and this PCR assay was positive for all the E. faecalis strains tested. Dot blot hybridization using either groES or groEL as the probe distinguished E. faecalis clearly from other species, indicating that both genes can be used as suitable targets for E. faecalis identification. Moreover, broad-range PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of groESL was designed to differentiate eight commonly encountered Enterococcus species. The Enterococcus species of reference strains could be easily differentiated on the basis of restriction patterns produced by HaeIII and RsaI. The DNA-based assays developed in this study provide an alternative to currently used methods of identification for clinically important enterococcal species.
TI  - Proteolysis and formation of volatile compounds in cheese manufactured with a bacteriocin-producing adjunct culture.
AB  - Hispanico cheese, a semi-hard Spanish variety, was manufactured from a mixture of pasteurized cows' and ewes' milks (4:1) using a commercial mesophilic LD-type starter comprising Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis var diacetylactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris. Varying amounts (0-1.0 g/kg) of an Enterococcus faecalis INIA 4 culture in milk were added as a bacteriocin-producing adjunct. Differences in pH between cheeses manufactured with and without the bacteriocin producer did not exceed 0.11 pH units. Starter lactococci lost viability more rapidly in cheeses made with the bacteriocin producer, which reached counts of up to 6 x 10(7) cfu/g during ripening. Aminopeptidase activity in 1-d-old cheese made from milk inoculated with 1.0 g bacteriocin-producing culture/kg was twice that in control cheese. Degrees of overall proteolysis and levels of total free amino acids in 45-d-old cheese made with 1.0 g bacteriocin-producing culture/kg were 1.80-fold and 2.17-fold those in control cheese of the same age. Inoculating milk with 1.0 g/kg bacteriocin-producing culture reduced the level of hydrophobic peptides in the resultant cheese, increased the concentrations of 3-methyl-1-butanal, diacetyl and acetoin, and resulted in the highest scores for flavour quality and flavour intensity throughout ripening.
TI  - Mdt(A), a new efflux protein conferring multiple antibiotic resistance in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The mdt(A) gene, previously designated mef214, from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis plasmid pK214 encodes a protein [Mdt(A) (multiple drug transporter)] with 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMS) that contain typical motifs conserved among the efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily. However, it also has two C-motifs (conserved in the fifth TMS of the antiporters) and a putative ATP-binding site. Expression of the cloned mdt(A) gene decreased susceptibility to macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, and tetracyclines in L. lactis and Escherichia coli, but not in Enterococcus faecalis or in Staphylococcus aureus. Glucose-dependent efflux of erythromycin and tetracycline was demonstrated in L. lactis and in E. coli.
TI  - Structure of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B: electron transfer between two flavin groups bridged by an iron-sulphur cluster.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fourth step and only redox reaction in pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis is catalyzed by the flavoprotein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD). Based on their sequences, DHODs are grouped into two major families. Lactococcus lactis is one of the few organisms with two DHODs, A and B, belonging to each of the two subgroups of family 1. The B enzyme (DHODB) is a prototype for DHODs in Gram-positive bacteria that use NAD+ as the second substrate. DHODB is a heterotetramer composed of two different proteins (PyrDB and PyrK) and three different cofactors: FMN, FAD, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster. RESULTS: Crystal structures have been determined for DHODB and its product complex. The DHODB heterotetramer is composed of two closely interacting PyrDB-PyrK dimers with the [2Fe-2S] cluster in their interface centered between the FMN and FAD groups. Conformational changes are observed between the complexed and uncomplexed state of the enzyme for the loop carrying the catalytic cysteine residue and one of the lysines interacting with FMN, which is important for substrate binding. CONCLUSIONS: A dimer of two PyrDB subunits resembling the family 1A enzymes forms the central core of DHODB. PyrK belongs to the NADPH ferredoxin reductase superfamily. The binding site for NAD+ has been deduced from the similarity to these proteins. The orotate binding in DHODB is similar to that in the family 1A enzymes. The close proximity of the three redox centers makes it possible to propose a possible electron transfer pathway involving residues conserved among the family 1B DHODs.
TI  - Heterologous expression of lacticin 3147 in Enterococcus faecalis: comparison of  biological activity with cytolysin.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum, two-component, lanthionine-containing bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC3147 which has widespread food and biomedical applications as a natural antimicrobial. Other two-component lantibiotics described to date include cytolysin and staphylococcin C55. Interestingly, cytolysin, produced by Enterococcus faecalis, has an associated haemolytic activity. The objective of this study was to compare the biological activity of lacticin 3147 with cytolysin. The lacticin 3147-encoding determinants were heterologously expressed in Ent. faecalis FA2-2, a plasmid-free strain, to generate Ent. faecalis pOM02, thereby facilitating a direct comparison with Ent. faecalis FA2-2.pAD1, a cytolysin producer. Both heterologously expressed lacticin 3147 and cytolysin exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against bacterial targets. Furthermore, enterococci expressing active lacticin 3147 did not exhibit a haemolytic activity against equine blood cells. The results thus indicate that the lacticin 3147 biosynthetic machinery can be heterologously expressed in an enterococcal background resulting in the production of the bacteriocin with no detectable haemolytic activity.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Carnobacterium, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus spp. from cooked, modified atmosphere packaged, refrigerated, poultry meat.
AB  - The microbiota of commercially produced, cooked and modified atmosphere packaged  poultry meat was followed during storage at 3.5 degrees C for up to 7 weeks. The dominant microbiota consisted of Lactococcus raffinolactis (117 isolates), Carnobacterium divergens (61 isolates), Carnobacterium piscicola (11 isolates), Lactococcus garvieae (four isolates), Lactococcus lactis (one isolate) and Enterococcus faecalis (three isolates). All isolates were screened for production of bacteriocins. Only C. piscicola isolates produced an inhibitory substance active against other lactic acid bacteria and against several Listeria spp. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used for the differentiation of Carnobacterium, L. raffinolactis, L. lactis, and L. garvieae strains associated with the modified atmosphere packaged poultry products. No false PCR products were observed with other closely related bacterial species.
TI  - Gene transfer to Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319.
AB  - Although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. To remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319. Firstly, transfer of Tn1545 has been obtained using an Enterococcus faecalis donor. Secondly, IncP-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from Escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. The yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic C. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. A restriction endonuclease was detected in crude extracts of C. cellulolyticum. This enzyme, named CCE:I, is an isoschizomer of MSP:I (HPA:II). Electro-transformation was employed to establish plasmids containing the replication functions of pAMss1 (En. faecalis), pIM13 (Bacillus subtilis), pCB102 (Clostridium butyricum), pIP404 (Clostridium perfringens) and pWV01 (Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in C. cellulolyticum. Transformants were only obtained if the DNA was appropriately methylated on the external C of the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' using either BSU:FI methylase in vivo or MSP:I methylase in vitro. Plasmids based on the pAMss1 and pIM13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pCB102 replicon. Selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg DNA) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. Selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg DNA). The methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor Tu in enterococci.
AB  - The elongation factor Tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a GTP binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. One to three tuf genes per genome are present, depending on the bacterial species. Most low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. We have designed degenerate PCR primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned inserts containing putative amplicons. Two different tuf genes (tufA and tufB) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus pseudoavium, and Enterococcus raffinosus. For the other six enterococcal species (Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus columbae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sulfureus, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, and Enterococcus solitarius), only the tufA gene was present. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. The presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufA gene branches with the Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufB gene clusters with the genera Streptococcus and Lactococcus. Primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufB genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and Lactococcus lactis. The data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.
TI  - Inducible expression of Enterococcus faecalis aggregation substance surface protein facilitates bacterial internalization by cultured enterocytes.
AB  - Aggregation substance (AS) is an Enterococcus faecalis surface protein that may contribute to virulence. Using a recently described system for controlled expression of AS in E. faecalis and the heterologous host Lactococcus lactis, experiments were designed to assess the effect of AS on bacterial internalization by HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes. AS expression was associated with increased internalization of E. faecalis by HT-29 enterocytes and of L. lactis by HT-29 and Caco-2 enterocytes. Compared to enterocytes cultivated under standard conditions, either cultivation in hypoxia or 1-h pretreatment of enterocytes with calcium-free medium resulted in increased internalization of both E. faecalis and L. lactis (with and without AS expression). Also, AS expression augmented these increases when E. faecalis was incubated with pretreated HT-29 enterocytes and when L. lactis was incubated with pretreated Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes. These data indicated that AS might facilitate E. faecalis internalization by cultured enterocytes.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and Vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Data from four recent studies (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; A. Y. C. Kwok et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) gene, amplified by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (ID). This Cpn60 gene ID method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and Streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. We report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 Enterococcus species (Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus rattus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam, and Enterococcus saccharolyticus), and Vagococcus fluvialis, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus garvieae. From 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the Facklam and Collins phenotyping method (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the Cpn60 ID method. In each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the Cpn60 ID method. The species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam (ATCC 700913), 3; E. asini, 1; E. rattus, 4; E. dispar, 2; E. gallinarum, 20; E. hirae, 9; E. durans, 9; E. faecalis, 12; E. mundtii, 3; E. casseliflavus, 8; E. faecium, 25; E. malodoratus, 3; E. raffinosus, 8; E. avium, 4; E. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown Enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain R871; Vagococcus fluvialis, 4; Lactococcus garvieae, 3; Lactococcus lactis, 3; Leuconostoc sp., 1; and Pediococcus sp., 1. The Cpn60 gene ID method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of Enterococcus and related organisms.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - Improved vectors for nisin-controlled expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A set of shuttle vectors, able to replicate in Escherichia coli and in gram-positive bacteria, containing a nisin-inducible promoter (PnisA) and genes encoding NisR and NisK, the two-component signaling mechanism for activating transcription from PnisA in the presence of nisin, was constructed. To test these vectors, Enterococcus faecalis pCF10 plasmid genes prgX, prgY, and prgZ, which respectively encode cytosolic, integral membrane, and cell surface proteins, were cloned downstream of PnisA. Increased protein expression, in the presence of nisin, was demonstrated by Western blot analysis.
TI  - Characterization of OpuA, a glycine-betaine uptake system of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A Lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli proP proU mutant with a gene library from L. lactis sbsp. cremoris. The cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opuA, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of Bacillus subtilis. Disruption of opuA in L. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. OpuA belongs to the so-called "ABC transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. In B. subtilis OpuA system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. In contrast, in the L. lactis opuA operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. Mapping of L. lactis opuA transcription start identified one mRNA, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. Construction of an opuA-gusA fusion confirmed that opuA transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in L. lactis. When recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of E. coli, the opuA promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in L. lactis.
TI  - Inactivation of the stress- and starvation-inducible gls24 operon has a pleiotrophic effect on cell morphology, stress sensitivity, and gene expression in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis induces the synthesis of at least 42 proteins during 24 h of glucose starvation. Because of its induction during carbohydrate and complete starvation (incubation in tap water) and CdCl(2) and bile salts stresses, one of these proteins (Gls24) was qualified as a "general stress protein" and was analyzed at the molecular level. Its corresponding gene, gls24, seems to be the penultimate gene of an operon composed, altogether, of six open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF preceding gls24 (orf4) showed very strong identity with gls24. The deduced polypeptides of these two genes showed similarity with a 20-kDa hypothetical protein from Lactococcus lactis and an alkaline stress protein from Staphylococcus aureus with no previously known biological significance. Data from the operon sequence and Northern analysis led to the conclusions that (i) gls24 possesses its own promoter which is especially induced at the onset of starvation and (ii) the operon promoter is stress inducible in exponential-phase cells. A mutation in the gls24 gene led to a severe reduction of growth rate and reduction of survival against 0.3% bile salts in the 24-h-starved cells compared to the wild-type strain. Moreover, the chain length of the mutant is significantly reduced during growth. These results argue strongly for a role of the protein Gls24 and/or GlsB in morphological changes and in stress tolerance in E. faecalis. Comparison of two-dimensional protein gels from wild-type cells with those from gls24 mutant cells revealed a pleiotropic effect of the mutation on gene expression. At least nine proteins were present in larger amounts in the mutant. For six of them, the corresponding N-terminal microsequence has been obtained. Three of these sequences map in genes coding for L-lactate dehydrogenase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and pyruvate decarboxylase, all involved in pyruvate metabolism.
TI  - Characterization of abundance and diversity of lactic acid bacteria in the hindgut of wood- and soil-feeding termites by molecular and culture-dependent techniques.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have been identified as typical and numerically significant  members of the gut microbiota of Reticulitermes flavipes and other wood-feeding lower termites. We found that also in the guts of the higher termites Nasutitermes arborum (wood-feeding), Thoracotermes macrothorax, and Anoplotermes pacificus (both soil-feeding), lactic acid bacteria represent the largest group of culturable carbohydrate-utilizing bacteria (3.6-5.2x10(4) bacteria per gut; 43%-54% of all colonies). All isolates were coccoid and phenotypically difficult to distinguish, but their enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC) fingerprint patterns showed a significant genetic diversity. Six different genotypes each were identified among the isolates from R. flavipes and T. macrothorax, and representative strains were selected for further characterization. By 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain RfL6 from R. flavipes was classified as a close relative of Enterococcus faecalis, whereas strain RfLs4 from R. flavipes and strain TmLO5 from T. macrothorax were closely related to Lactococcus lactis. All strains consumed oxygen during growth on glucose and cellobiose; oxygen consumption of these and other isolates from both termite species was due to NADH and pyruvate oxidase activities, but did not result in H2O2 formation. In order to assess the significance of the isolates in the hindgut, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to compare the fingerprints of 16S rRNA genes in the bacterial community of R. flavipes with those of representative isolates. The major DNA band from the hindgut bacterial community was further separated by bisbenzimide-polyethylene glycol electrophoresis, and the two resulting bands were sequenced. Whereas one sequence belonged to a spirochete, the second sequence was closely related to the sequences of the Lactococcus strains RfLs4 and TmLO5. Apparently, those isolates represent strains of a new Lactococcus species which forms a significant fraction of the complex hindgut community of the lower termite R. flavipes and possibly also of other termites.
TI  - A second dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (Type A) of the human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis: expression, purification, and steady-state kinetic mechanism.
AB  - We report the identification, expression, and characterization of a second Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODase A) from the human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. The enzyme consists of a polypeptide chain of 322 amino acids that shares 68% identity with the cognate type A enzyme from the bacterium Lactococcus lactis. E. faecalis DHODase A catalyzed the oxidation of l-dihydroorotate while reducing a number of substrates, including fumarate, coenzyme Q(0), and menadione. The steady-state kinetic mechanism has been determined with menadione as an oxidizing substrate at pH 7.5. Initial velocity and product inhibition data suggest that the enzyme follows a two-site nonclassical ping-pong kinetic mechanism. The absorbance of the active site FMN cofactor is quenched in a concentration-dependent manner by titration with orotate and barbituric acid, two competitive inhibitors with respect to dihydroorotate. In contrast, titration of the enzyme with menadione had no effect on FMN absorbance, consistent with nonoverlapping binding sites for dihyroorotate and menadione, as suggested from the kinetic mechanism. The reductive half-reaction has been shown to be only partially rate limiting, and an attempt to evaluate the slow step in the overall reaction has been made by simulating orotate production under steady-state conditions. Our data indicate that the oxidative half-reaction is a rate-limiting segment, while orotate, most likely, retains significant affinity for the reduced enzyme, as suggested by the product inhibition pattern.
TI  - Heterologous inducible expression of Enterococcus faecalis pCF10 aggregation substance asc10 in Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii contributes to cell hydrophobicity and adhesion to fibrin.
AB  - Aggregation substance proteins encoded by the sex pheromone plasmid family of Enterococcus faecalis have been shown previously to contribute to the formation of a stable mating complex between donor and recipient cells and have been implicated in the virulence of this increasingly important nosocomial pathogen. In an effort to characterize the protein further, prgB, the gene encoding the aggregation substance Asc10 on pCF10, was cloned in a vector containing the nisin-inducible nisA promoter and its two-component regulatory system. Expression of aggregation substance after nisin addition to cultures of E. faecalis and the heterologous bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii was demonstrated. Electron microscopy revealed that Asc10 was presented on the cell surfaces of E. faecalis and L. lactis but not on that of S. gordonii. The protein was also found in the cell culture supernatants of all three species. Characterization of Asc10 on the cell surfaces of E. faecalis and L. lactis revealed a significant increase in cell surface hydrophobicity upon expression of the protein. Heterologous expression of Asc10 on L. lactis also allowed the recognition of its binding ligand (EBS) on the enterococcal cell surface, as indicated by increased transfer of a conjugative transposon. We also found that adhesion of Asc10-expressing bacterial cells to fibrin was elevated, consistent with a role for the protein in the pathogenesis of enterococcal endocarditis. The data demonstrate that Asc10 expressed under the control of the nisA promoter in heterologous species will be an useful tool in the detailed characterization of this important enterococcal conjugation protein and virulence factor.
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - Identification and overexpression of ltnl, a novel gene which confers immunity to the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147.
AB  - Production and immunity of the two-component lantibiotic lacticin 3147 is encoded by the 60-2 kb lactococcal plasmid pMRC01. A 12.6 kb region of this plasmid, containing ten genes in two divergently arranged gene clusters, has been subcloned in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 and has been shown to confer both lacticin 3147 production and immunity. Further subcloning revealed that the smaller of the two clusters (ItnRIFE) confers immunity. Although the ItnF and E genes are homologous to ABC transporters which confer immunity to other lantibiotics, deletion analysis indicates that they do not play a role in the immunity exhibited by this subclone in L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. Also, a deletion in ItnR (which resembles a family of transcriptional repressors) had no effect on immunity. The remaining gene, Itnl, encodes a 116 amino acid protein with a predicted membrane location which bears no homology to other bacteriocin immunity proteins. Confirmation of its role in immunity was obtained when it was observed that disruption of Itnl resulted in a complete loss of immunity. When Itnl was cloned into the expression vector pMG36e, the resulting construct conferred levels of immunity comparable to pMRC01. This confirmed that under the control of a strong promoter, the Itnl gene product alone is sufficient to confer lacticin immunity. In addition, heterologous expression of Itnl was observed in Enterococcus faecalis OG1X. On cloning Itnl behind a nisin-inducible promoter, it was observed that the level of immunity was dependent on nisin concentration. Using this construct, the authors have demonstrated a potential role for Itnl as food-grade selectable marker. Thus, Ltnl appears to represent a new class of lantibiotic immunity proteins.
TI  - Chromosomal integration of the green fluorescent protein gene in lactic acid bacteria and the survival of marked strains in human gut simulations.
AB  - An integration vector was constructed to allow introduction of the gfp gene into  the chromosomes of Gram-positive bacteria. Integration depends on homologous recombination between a short 458-nt sequence of the tet(M) gene in the vector and a copy of Tn916 in the host chromosome. Strains of Lactococcus lactis IL1403, Enterococcus faecalis JH2-SS, and Streptococcus gordonii DL1 stably marked with single chromosomal copies of the gfp were readily visualised by epifluorescence microscopy. The marked L. lactis strain survived poorly in a continuous culture system inoculated with human faecal flora, while the laboratory E. faecalis strain was lost at approximately the dilution rate of the fermenter.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B of Enterococcus faecalis. Characterization and insights into chemical mechanism.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B is a heterodimer of 28 and 33 kDa encoded by the pyrK and pyrDb genes. Both subunits copurify during all chromatographic steps, and, as determined by HPLC, one FMN and one FAD are bound per heterodimer. The enzyme catalyzes efficient oxidation of 4-S-NADH by orotate. Isotope effect and pH data suggest that reduction of flavin by NADH at the PyrK site is only partially rate limiting with no kinetically significant proton transfer occurring in the reductive half-reaction; therefore, a group exhibiting a pK of 5.7 +/- 0.2 represents a residue involved in binding of NADH rather than in catalysis. The reducing equivalents are shuttled between the NADH-oxidizing flavin in PyrK and the orotate-reacting flavin in PyrDb, by iron-sulfur centers through flavin semiquinones as intermediates. A solvent kinetic isotope effect of 2.5 +/- 0.2 on V is indicative of rate-limiting protonation in the oxidative half-reaction and most likely reflects the interaction between the isoalloxazine N1 of the orotate-reducing flavin and Lys 168 (by analogy with L. lactis DHODase A). The oxidative half-reaction is facilitated by deprotonation of the group(s) with pK(s) of 5.8-6.3 and reflects either deprotonation of the reduced flavin or binding of orotate; this step is followed by hydride transfer to C6 and general acid-assisted protonation (pK of 9.1 +/- 0.2) at C5 of the product.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  - Production of pediocin in Pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pMBR1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. These four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. We have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter ST(P2201) from Streptococcus thermophilus, and repA from the 2-kbp S. thermophilus plasmid pER8. The recombinant plasmid, pPC318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in Escherichia coli. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with pPC418, a modified vector fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. Pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. The expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.
TI  - Effects of the addition of Enterococcus faecalis in Cebreiro cheese manufacture.
AB  - Ten batches of Cebreiro, a fresh or short-ripened acid-curd cheese, produced in the Galician mountains (NW Spain) were prepared from pasteurized milk inoculated with microorganisms isolated from raw-milk cheese. Two control batches were made with a Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis starter; 8 batches were made with the lactococcal starter plus one of eight Enterococcus faecalis cultures: 4 E. faecalis var. liquefaciens (EFLB) and 4 E. faecalis var. faecalis (EFFB). Whey dry matter in the EFLB was notably higher than in the control batches and this was related to lower cheese yields. After over 15 days storage the highest counts of both aerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria were observed for the EFLB. The lower content in protein on dry matter was found in the EFLB. The beta-casein broke down to a greater extent in the EFLB than in the EFFB, the lowest values being obtained for the control batches. The higher level of hydrolysis of alphax1-casein and maximum peptide alpha(s1) - I/alpha(s1)-casein ratio were obtained for EFFB at day 15 of storage. In all the batches made with enterococci soluble nitrogen was higher than in the control batches, with the highest values in the EFLB. In all the batches made with enterococci, volatile free fatty acid, long-chain free fatty acids and diacetyl and acetoin contents at days 10 and 15 of storage were higher than in the control batches, the highest values being obtained for EFLB. Acetic acid in all batches accounted for the main proportion of the volatile free fatty acids. Butyric and caproic acids were not detected in the volatile free fatty acids fractions of the control batches, but both acids were detected in most of the batches made with enterococci. The more intense acid taste was found in the EFFB and control batches, the most bitter taste being found in the EFLB. Buttery, rancid and spicy flavors were more evident in the EFLB. The rancid and spicy flavors were positively correlated with the contents of volatile free fatty acids and long-chain free fatty acids. The cheeses of EFLB proved to be more crumbly than the EFFB, whereas the stickiness and deformability were higher in the EFFB. The batches with similar organoleptic characteristics to those of traditional cheese were the batch IV made with the less proteolytic strain of E. faecalis var. liquefaciens, and the batch VI made with a moderate lipolytic activity strain of E. faecalis var. faecalis.
TI  - Lacticin 3147 displays activity in buffer against gram-positive bacterial pathogens which appear insensitive in standard plate assays.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. The reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Pneumococcus, Propionibacterium acne and Streptococcus mutans. This extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.
TI  - Survival of Enterococcus faecalis in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis was tested for the ability to persist in mouse peritoneal macrophages in two separate studies. In the first study, the intracellular survival of serum-passaged E. faecalis 418 and two isogenic mutants [cytolytic strain FA2-2(pAM714) and non-cytolytic strain FA2-2(pAM771)] was compared with that of Escherichia coli DH5alpha by infecting BALB/c mice intraperitoneally and then monitoring the survival of the bacteria within lavaged peritoneal macrophages over a 72-h period. All E. faecalis isolates were serum passaged to enhance the production of cytolysin. E. faecalis 418, FA2-2(pAM714), and FA2-2(pAM771) survived at a significantly higher level (P = 0.0001) than did E. coli DH5alpha at 24, 48, and 72 h. Internalized E. faecalis 418, FA2-2(pAM714), and FA2-2(pAM771) decreased 10-, 55-, and 31-fold, respectively, over the 72-h infection period, while internalized E. coli DH5alpha decreased 20, 542-fold. The difference in the rate of survival of E. faecalis strains and E. coli DH5alpha was most prominent between 6 and 48 h postinfection (P = 0.0001); however, no significant difference in killing was observed between 48 and 72 h postinfection. In the second study, additional E. faecalis strains from clinical sources, including DS16C2, MGH-2, OG1X, and the cytolytic strain FA2-2(pAM714), were compared with the nonpathogenic gram-positive bacterium, Lactococcus lactis K1, for the ability to survive in mouse peritoneal macrophages. In these experiments, the E. faecalis strains and L. lactis K1 were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth to ensure that there were equal quantities of injected bacteria. E. faecalis FA2-2(pAM714), DS16C2, MGH-2, and OG1X survived significantly better (P < 0.0001) than did L. lactis K1 at each time point. L. lactis K1 was rapidly destroyed by the macrophages, and by 24 h postinfection, viable L. lactis could not be recovered. E. faecalis FA2-2(pAM714), DS16C2, MGH-2, and OG1X declined at an equivalent rate over the 72-h infection period, and there was no significant difference in survival or rate of decline among the strains. E. faecalis FA2-2(pAM714), MGH-2, DS16C2, and OG1X exhibited an overall decrease of 25-, 55-, 186-, and 129-fold respectively, between 6 and 72 h postinfection. The overall reduction by 1.3 to 2.27 log units is slightly higher than that seen for serum-passaged E. faecalis strains and may be attributable to the higher level of uptake of serum-passaged E. faecalis than of E. faecalis grown in BHI broth. Electron microscopy of infected macrophages revealed that E. faecalis 418 was present within an intact phagocytic vacuole at 6 h postinfection but that by 24 h the infected macrophages were disorganized, the vacuolar membrane was degraded, and the bacterial cells had entered the cytoplasm. Macrophage destruction occurred by 48 h, and the bacteria were released. In conclusion, the results of these experiments indicate that E. faecalis can persist for an extended period in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in Enterococcus faecium DPC1146.
AB  - Enterocin A is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium DPC1146. The sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (ORFs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. The genes entA, entI, and entF encode the enterocin A prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. The deduced proteins EntK and EntR resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the AgrC-AgrA type. The predicted proteins EntT and EntD are homologous to ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of Escherichia coli hemolysin A. Immediately downstream of the entT and entD genes are two ORFs, the product of one of which, ORF4, is very similar to the product of the yteI gene of Bacillus subtilis and to E. coli protease IV, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. Another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. This putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to LafX, one of the components of the lactacin F complex. A deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the entA gene abolished enterocin A activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. Transposon insertion upstream of the entF gene also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. The putative EntI peptide was shown to be involved in the immunity to enterocin A. Cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted ORFs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin A and induction factor in Enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entAITD) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin A production in both E. faecalis and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Production of cholera toxin B subunit in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The intracellular expression of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was first achieved in Lactobacillus paracasei LbTGS1.4 with an expression cassette including the P25 promoter of Streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed L. pentosus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhD). Secretion of CTB was next attempted in L. paracasei LbTGS1.4 and L. plantarum NCIMB8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis Usp45 and PrtP, Enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and S. pyogenes M6 protein). Host-dependent secretion of CTB was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable CTB in the extracellular fraction of L. paracasei LbTGS1.4, secretion of CTB molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in L. plantarum NCIMB8826.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - The colonization of a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem by a  probiotic strain fed on a fermented oat bran product: effects on the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  - The effects of Lactobacillus-GG-fermented oat bran product on the microbiota and  its metabolic activity in the human gut were investigated, using a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME), by analysing the bacterial population, shortchain fatty acids and gas production. In addition, the effects of fermented oat bran supernatant and supernatant samples from reactors 4, 5 and 6 (large intestine) on the growth of Escherichia coli IHE 13047, Enterococcus faecalis VTT E-93203, Lactobacillus rhamnosus VTT E-94522 (Lactobacillus GG) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis VTT E-90414 were monitored to ascertain possible stimulatory/inhibitory effects by an in vitro turbidometric method. Our experiments showed that Lactobacillus GG colonized the SHIME reactor and this colonization could be maintained for several weeks without extra supplementation. Oat bran feeding also favoured the growth of bifidobacteria and caused an increase in the production of acetic, propionic and butyric acid as well as CH4 and CO2. However, the effects of oat bran, either on bacterial populations or on their metabolic activity, were not directly dose-dependent. In turbidometric measurements, the supernatant of fermented oat bran exerted an inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus GG, but stimulated the growth of enterococci.
TI  - Binding properties of Streptococcus gordonii SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated SspA (1,542 amino acid residues) and SspB (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. These polypeptides are members of the antigen I/II family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as Actinomyces naeslundii. To determine if SspA and SspB have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspA and sspB genes were cloned into expression plasmid vector pTREX1-usp45LS to generate pTREX1-sspA and pTREX1-sspB, respectively, and the Ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface SspA or SspB polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen I/II polypeptide substrates. More than twice as many L. lactis cells expressing SspA bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (SAG) as did L. lactis cells expressing SspB. In contrast, lactococci expressing SspB adhered twice as well as lactococci producing SspA to collagen type I and to Candida albicans. The binding of A. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of Ssp polypeptides. L. lactis(pTREX1-sspB) cells bound in greater numbers to SAG than did Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 cells expressing SspB from pAM401EB-5. The results suggest that SspA and SspB have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by S. gordonii.
TI  - Use of the lactococcal nisA promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  - We characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisA promoter in strains of the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. nisA promoter activity was dependent on the proteins NisR and NisK, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the extracellular inducer nisin. The nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. Significant induction of the nisA promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is inhibited. The efficiency of the nisA promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the Spac, xylA, and lacA promoters in B. subtilis and in S. pyogenes. Because nisA promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.
TI  - Heterogeneity of plant-associated streptococci as characterized by phenotypic features and restriction analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA.
AB  - Thirty-five strains of streptococci isolated from forage grasses were examined by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA. Using a set of seven endonucleases, five 16S rDNA genotypes were obtained. The isolates could be identified as belonging to the species Enterococcus faecium, Ent. mundtii, Ent. faecalis, Ent. casseliflavus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, respectively. To assign the isolates to one of these species, digestion with the endonuclease HinfI was sufficient. Data obtained from whole-cell protein analysis were in accordance with the species identification. Additionally, three of the five species found were subdivided into two related subgroups. Both methods are suitable for a rapid and unequivocal identification of plant-associated streptococci. The phenotypic characters showed a high diversity and were in some cases contrary to the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. The results demonstrated the close relatedness of the determined species in contrast to their high phenotypic heterogeneity.
TI  - A new theta-type thermosensitive replicon from Lactococcus lactis as an integration vector for Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - We isolated a replication thermosensitive mutant of the theta-type lactococcal pUCL22 replicon. An improved version of this thermosensitive replicon was obtained by fusioning the replication repA gene with the downstream repB gene. The resulting plasmid was named pUCB3522Ts. It is highly instable at 42 degrees C in Enterococcus faecalis. Integration into the chromosome via homologous recombination was monitored using the npr gene of E. faecalis JH2-2 as a target. A 513 bp PCR amplification product from an internal region of this npr gene was cloned into pUCB3522Ts. Integration of this construction into the JH2-2 npr gene was selected by shift temperature, from 30 degrees C to 42 degrees C. 85% of the analysed clones showed integration into the npr gene, demonstrating the practicality of this thermosensitive replicon as a genetic integrative tool for E. faecalis.
TI  - Characterization of the bacterial flora of Sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  - The microflora of a Sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a Sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. The dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were Gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5) cfu g-1. The spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from Gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lact. reuteri. The total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the pH dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. In this phase, only the Latter two species remained dominant in a ratio of 1:1. From the Sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of Lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. Sequence comparison of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. Five strains were classified as Lact. vaginalis and could be regarded as heterogeneous biovars of this species. The other two strains could be assigned to Lact. helveticus. RAPD-PCR and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.
TI  - Combined effect of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria and lactoperoxidase system activation on Listeria monocytogenes in refrigerated raw milk.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of three bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria alone and in combination with milk lactoperoxidase (LP) system activation against Listeria monocytogenes in refrigerated raw milk was studied. After 4 d at 4 degrees C, the population of L. monocytogenes in milk inoculated with bacteriocin-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454, L. lactis subsp. lactis ESI 515 or Enterococcus faecalis INIA 4 was reduced by 0.21-0.24 log units. Activation of the LP system did not enhance inhibition at this temperature. After 4 d at 8 degrees C, L. monocytogenes levels in the non-activated LP system milk inoculated with L. lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454, L. lactis subsp. lactis ESI 515 or Ent. faecalis INIA 4 were reduced by 1.87, 1.54 and 1.11 log units compared to control milk, whereas in the activated LP system milk, this reduction was 1.99, 2.10 and 1.06, respectively. The higher nisin production by L. lactis subsp. lactis ESI 515 in milk with activated LP system than in non-activated LP system milk was responsible for the more pronounced decrease of L. monocytogenes counts in the former.
TI  - Isolation and overexpression of a gene encoding an extracellular beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 was found to produce a 25-kDa extracellular enzyme active against beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucans. A gene was isolated encoding a specific beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase that corresponds to this size and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 16. A 4- to 10-fold increase in supernatant beta-glucanase activity was obtained when the cloned beta-glucanase gene was reintroduced into S. bovis JB1 by use of constructs based on the plasmid vector pTRW10 or pIL253. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase gene was also expressed upon introduction of the pTRW10 construct pTRWL1R into Lactococcus lactis IL2661 and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-SS, although extracellular activity was 8- to 50-fold lower than that in S. bovis JB1. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase purified from the culture supernatant of S. bovis JB1 carrying pTRWL1R showed a K(m) of 2.8 mg per ml and a Vmax of 338 mumol of glucose equivalents per min per mg of protein with barley beta-glucan as the substrate. The S. bovis beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase may contribute to the ability of this bacterium to utilize starch by degrading structural polysaccharides present in endosperm cell walls.
TI  - A computerised system for the identification of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A generic computerised system for the identification of bacteria was developed. The system is equipped with a key to the identification of lactic acid bacteria. The identification is carried out in two steps. The first step distinguishes groups of bacteria by following a decision tree with general identification tests. The second step in the identification is the distinction of species within a group on the basis of biochemical fermentation patterns. During grouping, probabilities for test failure are used. These probabilities can be used for assessing the quality of a given test answer. The probabilities are also used to select the most probable test answer in cases where the test result is inconclusive. The probabilities of test failure were determined by a group of experts and a group of potential users of the identification system. During species identification, similarity indices are calculated for all bacteria in a group. The described identification system has the ability to "learn" from different sessions in the species identification step, improving both identification speed and accuracy. Because of the versatile way in which the system is set up, it can very easily be expanded with identification keys to other organisms.
TI  - Use of an excision reporter plasmid to study the intracellular mobility of the conjugative transposon Tn916 in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - An excision reporter plasmid was constructed to characterize the intracellular mobility of Tn916 in various Gram-positive bacteria. The reporter component of this plasmid is a chloramphenicol-resistance gene which has been insertionally inactivated with the integrative vector pAT112 containing the attachment site of Tn916. Tn916-mediated excision of pAT112, to produce clones resistant to chloramphenicol, was detected in Enterococcus faecalis BM4110, Listeria monocytogenes L028-Str and Streptococcus gordonii BM120, but not in Lactococcus lactis MG1363-RF or in Streptococcus pneumoniae BM124, and always depended upon the ability of the bacterial host to generate circular forms of the transposon. The results suggest that (i) the excision event, although required, is not sufficient for conjugal transfer to occur and (ii) there is no linear relationship between the donor potential of E. faecalis strains and either the excision frequency of pAT112 or the copy number of Tn916 circular intermediates per cell in these hosts. Excision of pAT112 occurred mainly during the late exponential phase of growth of E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes and this recombination event was not stimulated by heat shock, salt and alcohol stresses or by the presence of tetracycline in the medium.
TI  - Primary and secondary structures of rRNA spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  - The 16S-23S and 23S-5S rRNA spacer DNA regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus mundtii were amplified by PCR. Their nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. Whereas lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without tRNA(Ala) were characterized. However, as shown for lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto, the tRNA(Ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal CCA trinucleotide. A putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the tRNA(Ala) gene. Based on comparison with Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. In E, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no tRNA(Ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. A similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in E. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. Such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23S rRNA coding sequences of some Gram-negative bacteria. The spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the tRNA(Ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of DNA-based typing methods.
TI  - Plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - Bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. During lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host chromosome at the 3' end of a tRNA(Ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (L. Dupont et al., J. Bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). A nonreplicative vector (pMC1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attP site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei (two strains), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Integrative recombination of pMC1 into the chromosomes of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pMC1 attP site. The isolation and sequencing of pMC1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pMC1 integrated into the conserved tRNA(Ser) gene. In the other bacterial species where this tRNA gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic DNA were used. A consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. The comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide CCT at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.
TI  - Development of a group B Streptococcus (GBS) cloning system.
AB  
TI  - Main microbial flora present as natural starters in Cebreiro raw cow's-milk cheese (northwest Spain).
AB  - Thirty samples of Cebreiro, a fresh or short-time-ripened raw cow's-milk cheese produced in Northwest Spain, were analyzed for the presence of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, (AMC) lactic acid bacteria (LAB), enterococci and Micrococcaceae. Mean AMC and LAB counts exceeding 10(9)/g were higher than those reported for other fresh or short-time-ripened cheeses, although Micrococcaceae occurred in lower numbers (< 10(5)/g) than reported for other raw-milk cheeses. Out of a total of 126 LAB representation isolates, 59 were identified as enterococci (38 as Enterococcus faecalis) 30 as lactococci (24 as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis), 25 as leuconostocs (14 as Leuconostoc mesenteroides) and 6 were identified as mesophylic lactobacilli. The enterocci in general were more proteolytic and produced more diacetyl/acetoin than the other LAB groups lactic acid bacteria isolated. It seems that a starter for making Cebreiro cheese should contain these microorganisms so as to reproduce the typical characteristics of traditional raw milk Cebreiro cheeses.
TI  - [Studies on purification and some properties of nisin from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis Al2].
AB  - Nisin from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis AL2 was extracted with n-propanol from NaCl-saturated culture and purified by ion-exchange chromotography on CM-Sephadex C-25. Nisin was purified 1.63 fold with a yield of 41.7%. The molecular weight of nisin was determined by SDS-PAGE to be about 3500. Nisin activity was stable at low pH and sensitive to digestion by a-chymotrypsin. Nisin is capable of inhibiting a broad range of gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, the gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, molds and Nip+ L. lactis subsp. lactis ATCC11454 were not inhibited.
TI  - Transfer of conjugative plasmid pAM beta 1 from Lactococcus lactis to mouse intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pAM beta 1 from Lactococcus lactis to intestinal bacteria of BALB/c mice was studied. Plasmid transfer was observed to Enterococcus faecalis in vitro by a filter mating method with transfer frequencies of 2.3 x 10-3 and with lower frequencies to other species. In vivo, using gastric intubation with the pAM beta 1-bearing Lactococcus lactis as donor and Ent. faecalis as recipient, a few transconjugants were detected from faecal Ent. faecalis. However, when these mice were given erythromycin through drinking water, a large number of conjugated Ent. faecalis were detected in faeces. Plasmid transfer to Ent. faecalis occurred at high frequency, 1.2 x 10-3, in mice whose anus was artificially closed after gastric intubation with pAM beta 1-bearing Lactococcus lactis. These results demonstrate clearly that pAM beta 1 transfer occurs between Gram-positive bacteria in the gut of mice harbouring many species of bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from goat's milk and artisanal cheeses: characteristics of a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus curvatus IFPL 105.
AB  - A total of 203 lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw goat's milk and artisanal cheese were tested for antibacterial activity. Only two strains of Lactococcus lactis, one strain of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Lactobacillus curvatus were shown to produce a bacteriocin-like substance. Lactobacillus curvatus IFPL105 produced a heat-stable bacteriocin, which was hydrolysed by alpha-chymotrypsin, proteinase K and pancreatin and exhibited a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity. The bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin was more potent when sensitive strains were in the logarithmic growth phase, inducing cell lysis, as observed by decreases in optical density and release of intracellular marker enzymes. Curing experiments resulted in variants that lacked both bacteriocin activity and immunity to the bacteriocin. Plasmid profile analysis of the parental strain and the bacteriocin-negative variants indicated that a plasmid of about 46 kbp may be involved in bacteriocin production and immunity to this antibacterial compound.
TI  - Prevention of histamine formation in cheese by bacteriocin-producing lactic Acid  bacteria.
AB  - The susceptibility of 13 amine-forming lactobacilli to several bacteriocins was investigated by an agar diffusion assay. All strains were susceptible to nisin and to five bacteriocins of enterococcal origin. Pediocin PA-1, bavaricin A, lactococcin A, and a bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis 1061 did not show inhibitory activity. Two bacteriocin-producing enterococci and a nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis strain were employed as starters in separate cheese-making experiments. Outgrowth of histamine producer Lactobacillus buchneri St2A, which was added to the milk at levels of up to 190 CFU/ml, was almost completely inhibited. No histamine formation was detected in the cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing starters. In the control cheese without bacteriocin, St2A reached levels of 1.1 x 10(sup8) CFU/g, and 200 mg of histamine per kg was found after 4 months of ripening. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of histamine formation in foods.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - To assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (O-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. For stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only Enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and ATCC 19433), Enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), Enterococcus casseliflavus (ATCC 25778), and Enterococcus gallinarum (ATCC 35038) produced extracellular O-2. Among 106 strains comprising 13 species of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular O-2. Mean (+/-SE) rates of extracellular O-2 production in vitro by E . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of O-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (P=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular O-2 production.
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. We associated the insertion sequence ISS1 with the thermosensitive replicon pG+ host to generate a mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. ISS1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus thermophilus. High-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in Lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. After ISS1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated ISS1 sequences flanking pG+ host. This structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. In addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single ISS1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. Mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.
TI  - Transposons Tn916 and Tn925 can transfer from Enterococcus faecalis to Leuconostoc oenos.
AB  - The streptococcal transposons Tn916 and Tn925 were transferred to several strains of Leuconostoc (Ln.) oenos using the filter mating method. The insertion of both transposons into the chromosome occurred at different sites. Transconjugants of Ln. oenos carrying Tn916 could serve as donors in mating experiments with Lactococcus lactis LM2301. Further analysis of L. lactis LM2301 transconjugants showed that the insertion of the transposon Tn916 into the chromosome was site-specific. These studies establish a basis for the initiation of genetic studies in this Leuconostoc species since there are no efficient conjugal or transformation systems previously described for this microorganism.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the rpoD gene of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the rpoD gene of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433 has been determined. This gene encodes a putative 368 amino acids (aa) polypeptide of a predicted Mr of 41842 named sigma 42. Upstream of the rpoD gene and beginning from the end of the cloned chromosomal fragment is an open reading frame encoding a putative 264-aa polypeptide. It is reminiscent of the C-terminal domain of known DNA primase from Gram-positive bacteria indicating that the E. faecalis rpoD gene is included in a macromolecular synthesis (MMS) operon, as it was described for Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis rpoD gene.
TI  - Positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (R/M) systems of different specificities. A novel IIS type R/M system encoded by the LlaI operon has previously been characterized from the L. lactis conjugative plasmid pTR2030. The LlaI operon is composed of six genes: First, a small regulatory gene llaIC precedes the methylase gene llaIM. The following three genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, llaI.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llaIR. The forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llaIR gene cassette. We have successfully subcloned the three llaIR genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, and llaI.3, without llaIM, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors pTRKL2, pTRKH2, and pBV5030. A promoter (P6) from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, which is functional in E. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (Djordjevic and Topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. Restriction activity was evaluated in Escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. The llaIR restriction cassette was not functional in E. coli, but its presence was lethal to L. lactis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Carnobacterium pisicola, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Leuconostoc gelidum. Several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llaIR cassette. Insertions in llaI.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. These positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. Functional activity of the llaIR genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
TI  - Generation of auxotrophic mutants of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A 22-kb segment of chromosomal DNA from Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF containing the pyrimidine biosynthesis genes pyrC and pyrD was previously detected as complementing Escherichia coli pyrC and pyrD mutations. In the present study, it was found that the E. faecalis pyrimidine biosynthetic genes in this clone (designated pKV48) are part of a larger cluster resembling that seen in Bacillus spp. Transposon insertions were isolated at a number of sites throughout the cluster and resulted in loss of the ability to complement E. coli auxotrophs. The DNA sequences of the entire pyrD gene of E. faecalis and selected parts of the rest of the cluster were determined, and computer analyses found these to be similar to genes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus caldolyticus pyrimidine biosynthesis operons. Five of the transposon insertions were introduced back into the E. faecalis chromosome, and all except insertions in pyrD resulted in pyrimidine auxotrophy. The prototrophy of pyrD knockouts was observed for two different insertions and suggests that E. faecalis is similar to Lactococcus lactis, which has been shown to possess two pyrD genes. A similar analysis was performed with the purL gene from E. faecalis, contained in another cosmid clone, and purine auxotrophs were isolated. In addition, a pool of random transposon insertions in pKV48, isolated in E. coli, was introduced into the E. faecalis chromosome en masse, and an auxotroph was obtained. These results demonstrate a new methodology for constructing defined knockout mutations in E. faecalis.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the tetL gene and identification  of iso-ISS1 elements from Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1.
AB  - The tetracycline-resistance (TcR) determinant of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1 has been identified and located on a 2.2-kb RsaI-EcoRI fragment. The fragment was cloned in Escherichia coli, and specified TcR in this host. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1374 bp, designated tetL. The nt sequence of tetL from pJH1 was identical to that of the tetL present on pLS1 from Streptococcus agalactiae. Upstream of the pJH1 tetL, part of another ORF was found that, except for two single-nt substitutions, was identical to an iso-ISS1 element from Lactococcus lactis. Hybridization studies indicated the presence of several ISS1-like elements in plasmid pJH1, but not on the En. faecalis chromosome. To study its usefulness as a marker in Gram+ organisms, the pJH1 tetL was cloned on the broad-host-range plasmid pNZ124, resulting in pNZ280, that was found to give resistance to 40 micrograms Tc/ml in Lc. lactis and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.
AB  - A gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified in a genomic library of the strain in pUC19 by screening Escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity on a medium containing autoclaved, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells. In cell extracts of L. lactis MG1363 and several halo-producing E. coli transformants, lytic bands of similar sizes were identified by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels containing L. lactis or M. lysodeikticus cell walls. Of these clearing bands, corresponding to the presence of lytic enzymes with sizes of 46 and 41 kDa, the 41-kDa band was also present in the supernatant of an L. lactis culture. Deletion analysis of one of the recombinant plasmids showed that the information specifying lytic activity was contained within a 2,428-bp EcoRV-Sau3A fragment. Sequencing of part of this fragment revealed a gene (acmA) that could encode a polypeptide of 437 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular mass of AcmA (46,564 Da) corresponded to that of one of the lytic activities detected. Presumably, the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor protein which is processed by cleavage after the Ala at position 57, thus producing a mature protein with a size of 40,264 Da, which would correspond to the size of the enzyme whose lytic activity was present in culture supernatants of L. lactis. The N-terminal region of the mature protein showed 60% identity with the N-terminal region of the mature muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae and the autolysin of Streptococcus faecalis. Like the latter two enzymes, AcmA contains C-terminal repeated regions. In AcmA, these three repeats are separated by nonhomologous intervening sequences highly enriched in serine, threonine, and asparagine. Genes specifying identical activities were detected in various strains of L. lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detection assay and PCR experiments. By replacement recombination, an acmA deletion mutant which grew as long chains was constructed, indicating that AcmA is required for cell separation.
TI  - Heterogeneric conjugal transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 (IncHlyI) of Enterococcus faecalis in the apparent absence of pheromone induction.
AB  - Erythromycin-resistant derivatives of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 from Enterococcus faecalis were constructed to study its host range. This was done by inserting the integrative vector pAT112 and the related replicon pTCR1 harboring oriR of the broad host range plasmid pAM beta 1 into the hemolysin-bacteriocin operon of pIP964, to give pTCR2 and pTCR3, respectively. Plasmid pTCR2 was transferred by filter matings from E. faecalis to Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes at frequencies of 2 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) per donor, respectively, in the apparent absence of pheromone induction and cellular aggregation. In these hosts, pTCR2 remained intact as a self-replicating element and maintained its transfer capabilities. Plasmid pTCR3, but not pTCR2, was transferred at similar frequencies from E. faecalis to Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus agalactiae. Thus, the transfer system of pIP964 possesses a broader host-range than its replication system.
TI  - Study of gene transfer in vitro and in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice from Lactococcus lactis strains to various strains belonging to human intestinal flora.
AB  - The use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in dairy products requires evaluation of the DNA transfer capacity from such organisms among the human intestinal microflora. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo [in the digestive tract (DT) of mice] transfer from Lactococcus lactis donor strains of the conjugative plasmid pIL205 (CmR) and the non-conjugative plasmid pIL253 (EmR) to: (1) recipient strains isolated from human faecal flora Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Peptostreptococcus sp. (strictly anaerobic bacterial strains) and Enterococcus faecalis, (2) a whole human faecal flora, was studied. In both cases, no gene transfer was observed to strictly anaerobic bacterial strains. DNA transfer was only observed to the E. faecalis strain: in vivo CmR E. faecalis transconjugants were isolated from sequentially multi-associated mice and when the recipient strains associated with the mice, they were a defined mixture of Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Peptostreptococcus sp. and E. faecalis strains. When mice were associated with the whole human faecal flora, the plasmid pIL205 was transferred into some facultative anaerobic streptococci. It was also shown that DNA transfer occurred even when the lactococcal donor strain was transient in the DT of the gnotobiotic host animals.
TI  - Insertions of IS256-like element flanking the chromosomal beta-lactamase gene of  Enterococcus faecalis CX19.
AB  - We have previously identified an inverted repeat characteristic of staphylococcal beta-lactamase transposons adjacent to the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes of Enterococcus faecalis CH19 and its beta-lactamase-producing transconjugant CX19. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the CH19 beta-lactamase structural gene (blaZ) reveals it to be identical to the blaZ gene from E. faecalis HH22 and to the blaZ gene from the staphylococcal beta-lactamase transposon Tn552. We also report the presence of nucleotide sequence identical to a 317-bp region of the staphylococcal insertion sequence IS256 upstream of the blaZ gene in both CH19 and CX19. The identical segment of IS256 is present downstream of the blaZ gene of CX19, suggesting a second insertion of the element (in the inverted orientation) accompanying transfer to the recipient strain. Restriction analysis of the areas beyond the ClaI sites used to clone these regions suggests that full copies of the IS256-like element (designated IS256E) are present in all positions but that these elements were not directly involved in the transfer of the beta-lactamase gene to the recipient strain. We have also identified a region downstream of the second IS256E insertion site which exhibits substantial homology to ISSIW, an iso-ISSI insertion originally identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data suggest that the two enterococcal blaZ genes sequenced to date evolved from a common ancestor and may at one time have been incorporated into a transposon similar to Tn552. They also suggest that IS256-like elements are mobile in E. faecalis and capable of inserting in a manner consistent with the formation of novel composite transposons. Finally, they provide the first confirmation of the presence of an ISSI-like element in enterococci, raising the possibility that these elements play a role in the exchange of chromosomal antimicrobial resistance determinants.
TI  - Conjugative transposition of Tn916: preferred targets and evidence for conjugative transfer of a single strand and for a double-stranded circular intermediate.
AB  - Transposition of conjugative transposons proceeds by excision and formation of a  covalently closed circular intermediate that includes at its joint the six flanking bases from its previous host (coupling sequences). To elucidate the role of the coupling sequences in this process and to determine the sequence of targets used by Tn916, we studied its insertion into a plasmid following conjugation. The results differ from those previously observed when Tn916 was introduced by transformation. They suggest that only one specific strand of the transposon molecule is transferred during the conjugation event and that complementary strand synthesis produces a double-stranded transposon circle with no mismatches which serves as the reaction intermediate. Tn916 inserts preferentially at specific sites and the same targets are used when Tn916 comes from donors with different coupling sequences. An analysis of the sequences of preferred targets is presented.
TI  - Differences in sensitivity to NADH of purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes of Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Azotobacter vinelandii and Escherichia coli: implications for their activity in vivo.
AB  - The effect of NADH on the activity of the purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (PDHc) of Enterococcus (Ec.) faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Azotobacter vinelandii and Escherichia coli was determined in vitro. It was found that the PDHc of E. coli and L. lactis was active only at relatively low NADH/NAD ratios, whereas the PDHc of Ec. faecalis was inhibited only at high NADH/NAD ratios. The PDHc of Azotobacter vinelandii showed an intermediate sensitivity. The organisms were grown in chemostat culture under conditions that led to different intracellular NADH/NAD ratios and the PDHc activities in vivo could be calculated from the specific rates of product formation. Under anaerobic growth conditions, only Ec. faecalis expressed PDHc activity in vivo. The activities in vivo of the complexes of the different organisms were in good agreement with their properties determined in vitro. The physiological consequences of these results are discussed.
TI  - Gene transfer from engineered Lactococcus lactis strains to Enterococcus faecalis in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The introduction of genetically modified organisms into food products requires an evaluation of the behaviour and the dissemination of foreign genes of such organisms among the human intestinal microflora. The conjugal transfer, both in vitro and in vivo (in mice digestive tract) of DNA from Lactococcus lactis donor strains to an Enterococcus faecalis strain isolated from human faecal flora was studied. We followed the transfer of (1) the self-transmissible plasmid pIL205; (2) two non-self-transmissible but mobilizable plasmids, pIL252 and pIL253; (3) one plasmid, pMS1.5B, integrated into the chromosome of L. lactis. In vitro, the transfer frequency of pIL205 (expressed as the number of transconjugants per donor cell) was 9.6 x 10(-4); mobilization of one of the non-self-transmissible plasmids, pIL253, was observed (4.9 x 10(-7)). In vivo, only transfer of pIL205 and pIL253 occurred, but the frequency was not determined. The transfer of pMS1.5B was not detected in vitro or in vivo.
TI  - Partial characterization of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  - With degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal DNA fragment of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sequence of this PCR product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "RpoD box" of primary sigma factors. This PCR product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on Salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  - A defined bacterial culture protective against Salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (CF) culture apparatus. Chicks receiving the CF culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by S. typhimurium. The culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus avium, two strains of Enterococcus faecalis (designated A and B), Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus animalis, a Lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain CMS), Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, E. fergusonii, Bifidobacterium animals, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici. Results indicated that CF cultures can be used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to S. typhimurium in the chick cecum.
TI  - Efficient plasmid mobilization by pIP501 in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - pIP501 is a streptococcal conjugative plasmid which can be transmitted among numerous gram-positive strains. To identify a minimal mobilization (mob) locus of pIP501, DNA fragments of pIP501 were cloned into nonconjugative target plasmids and tested for mobilization by pIP501. We show that nonmobilizable plasmids containing a specific fragment of pIP501 are transmitted at high frequencies between Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains if transfer (tra) functions are provided in trans by a pIP501 derivative. Independent transfer of the mobilized plasmid was observed in up to 44% of transconjugants. A 2.2-kb segment containing mob was sequenced. This DNA segment is characterized by three palindromes (palI, palII, and palIII) and a 202-amino-acid open reading frame (ORFX) of unknown function. The smallest DNA fragment conferring high frequency mobilization was localized to a 1.0-kb region (extending from pIP501 coordinates 3.60 to 4.60 on the 30.2-kb map) which contains palI (delta G = -27 kcal/mol [ca. -110,000 J/mol]). A 26-bp sequence identical to palI is present on pIP501, upstream of the plasmid copy control region. Further homologies with the palI sequence are also found with the related Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid pAM beta 1. The region containing mob maps outside the previously described segment mediating pIP501 conjugation. Our results with recA strains indicate that the mob site is a hot spot for cointegrate formation.
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - Presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. We isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. Samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. Enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus hirae, and Enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other. These bacteria were found in a variety of samples. Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. On the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as E. casseliflavus. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. Nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile groups which could not be identified with the aid of known Aerococcus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, or Streptococcus strains. The maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Staphylococcal phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Staphylococcus carnosus ptsI gene and expression and complementation studies of the gene product.
AB  - A digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe that was complementary to the gene ptsH and the beginning of the gene ptsI was used to clone a 3.2-kb HincII-BamHI restriction fragment containing the complete ptsI gene of Staphylococcus carnosus. The restriction fragment was cloned in the antisense orientation to the lac promoter in the low-copy-number vector pSU18. The nucleotide sequences of the ptsI gene, which encodes enzyme I (EC 2.7.3.9), and the corresponding flanking regions were determined. The primary translation product, derived from the nucleotide sequence, consists of 574 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 63,369. Amino acid sequence comparison showed 47% similarity to enzyme I of Escherichia coli and 37% similarity to the enzyme I domain of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein of Rhodobacter capsulatus. The histidinyl residue at position 191 could be identified as the probable phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation site of enzyme I of S. carnosus because of sequence homologies with the peptide sequences of enzyme I-active sites of Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis. Several in vivo and in vitro complementation studies with the enzyme I ptsI genes of S. carnosus and the E. coli ptsI mutant JLT2 were carried out. The generation times and interaction between enzyme I with histidine-containing protein from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were measured in a phosphoryl group transfer test.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Listeria spp. on Camembert cheese by bacteria producing inhibitory substances.
AB  - Bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity towards other bacteria are quite common in nature. During the past few years several genera have been shown to exert inhibitory action against Listeria. spp. In the present work strains of Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were tested for their influence on the development of Listeria spp. on Camembert cheese. Partial or complete inhibition of growth of Listeria spp. was observed using various inhibitory bacteria. Complete inhibition occurred when the inhibitory strain was used as a starter culture and there was a low level of contamination with Listeria spp. during the first stage of ripening. Very little inhibition occurred if the inhibitory strain was added together with the starter culture.
TI  - A host factor absent from Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis MG1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  - In matings between Lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons Tn916  and Tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. In agreement with this, the frequency of L. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant Tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. However, in intergeneric crosses with Bacillus subtilis or Enterococcus faecalis donors, Tn916 and Tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the L. lactis transconjugants. Moreover, Tn916 and Tn919 could not be transferred by conjugation from L. lactis and B. subtilis, E. faecalis or Streptococcus pyogenes. This suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in L. lactis. When cloned into E. coli with adjacent chromosomal DNA from L. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. Therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in L. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. We conclude that L. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.
TI  - Chromosomal integration of plasmid DNA by homologous recombination in Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis hosts harboring Tn919.
AB  - Integration of pCI192, a pBR322-derived vector plasmid containing homology to the chromosomally located conjugative transposon Tn919 was observed in two strains that harbor Tn919, namely, Enterococcus faecalis GF590 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis CH919. Hybridization analysis indicated that single-copy integration of the plasmid had occurred at low frequency. The Tn919::plasmid structure was conjugated from an E. faecalis donor to a L. lactis recipient, although at lower frequencies than was Tn919. Segregation of the tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance markers during conjugation was observed. The integration strategy described allows for DNA manipulations to be performed in an easily manipulated model host strain with the subsequent transfer of integrated structures by conjugation to any strain capable of receiving Tn919. The results indicate that homologous recombination events may be used to introduce plasmid-encoded genes to the lactococcal chromosome.
TI  - Distribution and purification of aspartate racemase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as Streptococcus species and Lactobacillus species. The enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 was more thermostable than that from Streptococcus lactis IAM1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. We purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of S. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. The enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees C and around pH 8.0. The sequence of the NH2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be Met-Glu-Asn-Phe-Phe-Ser-Ile-Leu-Gly-XXX-Met-Gly-Thr-Met-Ala-Thr-Glu-Ser- Phe-.
TI  - Shuttle vectors containing a multiple cloning site and a lacZ alpha gene for conjugal transfer of DNA from Escherichia coli to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The mobilizable shuttle cloning vectors, pAT18 and pAT19, are composed of: (i) the replication origins of pUC and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1; (ii) an erythromycin-resistance-encoding gene expressed in Gram- and Gram+ bacteria; (iii) the transfer origin of the IncP plasmid RK2; and (iv) the multiple cloning site and the lacZ alpha reporter gene of pUC18 (pAT18) and pUC19 (pAT19). These 6.6-kb plasmids contain ten unique cloning sites that allow screening of derivatives containing DNA inserts by alpha-complementation in Escherichia coli carrying the lacZ delta M15 deletion, and can be efficiently mobilized by self-transferable IncP plasmids co-resident in the E. coli donors. Plasmids pAT18, pAT19 and recombinant derivatives have been successfully transferred by conjugation from E. coli to Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9). The presence of a restriction system in the recipient dramatically affects (by three orders of magnitude) the efficiency of conjugal transfer of these vectors from E. coli to Gram+ bacteria.
TI  - Identification of a new genetic determinant for cell aggregation associated with  lactose plasmid transfer in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Derivatives of the lactose miniplasmid pMG820 were constructed in which a staphylococcal erm gene was inserted and in which this was accompanied by subsequent deletion of the lactose genes. The resulting plasmids were thus marked with both erythromycin resistance and lactose utilization genes in pF1132 or solely erythromycin resistance in pF1133. These plasmids retained the normal conjugation properties characteristic of lactose plasmid pLP712, including the generation by intermolecular rearrangement of high-frequency-transfer Clu+ derivatives which exhibited cell aggregation. The use of such Clu+ plasmids in a variety of mating experiments between different lactococcal strains and the observation of cell aggregation when particular mating mixtures were made led to the discovery of a new component of this conjugation system named Agg. A chromosomal gene agg was postulated to be present in some but not all strains of lactococci. High-frequency conjugation and cell aggregation thus depend on the presence of both Agg and Clu, although in a mating pair these components can be in the same or in separate strains. The Agg and Clu components may be analogous to the binding substance and aggregation substance that are involved in the hemolysin plasmid transfer system of Enterococcus faecalis, although control of their expression is different.
TI  - Natural transfer of conjugative transposon Tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative streptococcal transposon Tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. Enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for Alcaligenes eutrophus, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). No transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. Mating of an E. coli strain carrying Tn916 yielded transconjugants with Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). Acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. The results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as Tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially contributing to bacterial evolution.
TI  - Separation of antibiotics by autofocusing.
AB  - The autofocusing separation of nine antibiotics was investigated: tetracycline and chloramphenicol in large-scale batches, and seven others in gram preparation amounts. All except one were found to be heterogeneous in autofocusing, and 2-4 well-characterized fractions emerged. These heterogeneities are described and the industrial utilization of the procedure is suggested.
TI  - Identification of lactococci and enterococci by colony hybridization with 23S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Specific sequences of 23S rRNA of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccus faecium, and Enterococcus malodoratus/Enterococcus avium were identified, and complementary oligonucleotide probes were synthesized. The specificity of the probes was evaluated by dot blot and colony hybridizations. The probes can be used for the specific detection and identification of colonies of the corresponding species in mixed cultures.
TI  - Recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from children.
AB  - A cross-sectional survey of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (VRGPC) in the feces of children was initiated after several bacteremic infections with these organisms occurred at our hospital. A selective medium consisting of colistin-nalidixic acid agar, 5% sheep blood, vancomycin (5 mg/liter), and amphotericin B (8 mg/liter) was developed to isolate VRGPC. A single stool specimen submitted to the clinical microbiology laboratory from each of 48 patients was inoculated onto the medium. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C with 5% carbon dioxide and examined at 24, 48, and 72 h. Susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution. A total of 14 isolates from 11 of 48 (22%) children were recovered. The density of growth ranged from a single colony to 2+. The VRGPC were identified as Leuconostoc lactis (n = 2), Lactobacillus confusus (n = 4), Enterococcus species (n = 5), and Lactococcus lactis (n = 3). One strain of Lactobacillus confusus was recovered from both the stool and the blood of one of these patients. The MICs of vancomycin were 4 micrograms/ml for one of the isolates, 8 micrograms/ml for four of the isolates, and more than 16 micrograms/ml for the remaining eight isolates. All isolates were susceptible to both penicillin and ampicillin. Only 1 of the 11 children had received prior treatment with vancomycin. We conclude that low concentrations of VRGPC may be common in the gastrointestinal tracts of children.
TI  - Conjugal mobilization of streptococcal plasmid pMV158 between strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - pMV158, a non-self-transmissible plasmid encoding tetracycline resistance, was conjugally transferred from Enterococcus faecalis JH203 to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403. This transfer appeared to be dependent on the cotransfer of the conjugative plasmids pAM beta 1 or pIP501. Intraspecies conjugal transfer of pMV158 also occurred in strain IL1403. In contrast to the transfer from E. faecalis, transfer in IL1403 did not require the presence of a conjugative plasmid in the donor strain but, rather, appeared to be dependent on putative chromosomal functions in strain IL1403. The transfer of pMV158 from strain IL1403 required the presence of an active pMV158-encoded protein, which showed homology to the Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded by several small plasmids extracted from Staphylococcus aureus, such as pT181.
TI  - Evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pIP501 into strains of Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - The conjugative broad host range plasmid pIP501 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. With these transconjugants as donors the plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of Strep. thermophilus. There was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of Lact. helveticus. Transfer from Lact. helveticus to Strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. There was no evidence for the conjugal transfer of plasmid pIP501 into a strain of Lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either lactic streptococci or Lactobacillus sp.
TI  - Intergeneric and intrageneric conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance determinants in Leuconostoc spp.
AB  - Transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 from Streptococcus faecalis to Leuconostoc dextranicum and Leuconostoc cremoris occurred between cells that were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of DNase. Transfer of pIP501 to Leuconostoc spp. also occurred when Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus lactis were used as donors. In addition, transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 was observed from L. cremoris and L. dextranicum transconjugants to S. sanguis and S. faecalis. Expression of the pAM beta 1 erythromycin and pIP501 erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was essentially equivalent in donors and transconjugants. Frequencies of transfer generally ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. Intrageneric transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 occurred between L. cremoris and L. dextranicum strains in the same approximate range. These data further extend the host range of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 and demonstrate another example of gene transfer in the genus Leuconostoc.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pAM beta 1 in Lactobacillus reuteri and between lactobacilli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAM beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred conjugally from Streptococcus lactis to Lactobacillus reuteri, L. murinus, and L. fermentum. Transfer of pAM beta 1 between two L. reuteri strains occurred, and lactobacillus transconjugants could act as donors of pAM beta 1 in crosses with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization as an alternative vector delivery system for lactic streptococci.
AB  - Due to the current variability in applying polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation to lactic streptococci, a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of conjugative mobilization as an alternative method for vector delivery. By using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pVA797, the partially homologous cloning vector pVA838 was successfully introduced into various strains of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis. Frequencies ranged from 10(-2) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Both pVA797 and pVA838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. Also, the shuttle vector pSA3, which shares partial homology with pVA797, was mobilized via conjugation. The use of S. lactis LM2301 as the intermediate donor allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation. The construction of a vector containing a "DNA cassette" conferring mobilization and the resolution, segregation, and stability of the cointegrates, pVA797, pVA838, and pSA3, are also reported.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk with special reference  to the biodegradation of casein fractions.
AB  - Streptococci and lactobacilli were assayed for their proteolytic activity in pasteurised (95 degrees C for 30 min) fresh Friesian cows' skim milk incubated at 30 degrees C for 48 h. Lactobacilli were more proteolytic than the streptococci except S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens. S. faecalis and S. thermophilus followed S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis in the proteolytic activity. Electrophoretic analysis of the precipitated casein revealed K-, pre-beta- and the small slow band of alpha s1-casein to be the most fractions and beta-casein the least fraction susceptible to the biodegradation. S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was the only organism able to degrade beta-casein to 3 fractions within 48 h. S. lactis with its subsp. diacetylactis was characterized by its inability to degrade gamma-casein. Addition of 2.0 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 2.0 mmol Mg2+, 0.5 mmol Mn2+ and 0.1 mmol Fe2+/l of skim milk culture of each L. casei and L. plantarum increased acid formation but decreased proteolysis. 6% NaCl was inhibitory to both. After 60 days at 18 degrees C, a fraction, probably derived from beta-casein, was noticeable. The large intense band of alpha s1-casein appears to be degraded gradually to only small peptides which in turn are transferred immediately into the cells. The hydrolysis of gamma-casein and beta-casein also appears to be inhibited by exogenously supplied NaCl and nutrients, respectively.
TI  - Reconstitution of ATP-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  - Membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus lactis, and Streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-D-glucoside in the presence of Escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. For reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated E. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-D-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. ATP-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was comparable to that found in parent vesicles. Recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. The properties of ATP-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. In proteoliposomes, ATP-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the F0F1-ATPase. On the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microM vanadate, for S. faecalis, S. lactis, and S. sanguis, respectively. This marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an E1E2-type ion-motive pump. These data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an ATP-dependent proton circulation via the F0F1-ATPase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating ATPase. Thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an ATP-linked process analogous to the ion-motive ATPases of eukaryotic membranes.
TI  - Malachite green pre-enrichment medium for improved salmonella isolation from heavily contaminated samples.
AB  - Large numbers of competitive bacteria may hinder the isolation of salmonellas from food and environmental samples when a pre-enrichment method is used. The addition of 0.1 g/l of malachite green (MG) to buffered peptone water (BPW) inhibited the multiplication of Gram-positive bacteria. Brilliant green had a similar effect but only when the normal recommended concentration of 0.02 g/l was raised to 0.05 g/l. Pure strains of salmonellas were inhibited by MG in BPW, but addition of non fat dried milk (NFDM) (5 g/l or more) counteracted this effect. MG did not affect the recovery of salmonellas injured by heat, freezing, low water activity or acidity in BPW with NFDM. It was concluded that addition of MG to BPW may improve the possibility of isolating salmonellas from heavily contaminated materials by limiting the competitive growth of Gram-positive bacteria and the subsequent lowering of the pH of the broth.
TI  - The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Isolation  of active site peptides by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determination of their primary structure.
AB  - Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) it was possible to isolate 32P-labelled active-site regions of various proteins from the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The purified peptides obtained by proteolytic cleavage with Lys-C protease and trypsin were sequenced by the gas phase method. The fragments derived from enzyme I (MW 70 000) of two streptococcal species show 100% homology. The analogous peptide of Staphylococcus aureus Enzyme I differs in the N-terminal region. A labelled peptide from the glucose-specific enzyme III protein of Escherichia coli obtained by cleavage with alkaline protease was isolated and sequenced. It could be fitted into the primary structure of this protein, which was derived from DNA sequence data. The active-site histidine residue of this protein is therefore localized at position 91. The HPLC separation method described is suitable for the isolation of peptides derived from active sites containing labile amino acid derivatives such as phosphohistidines.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - Identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). PBPs with similar properties are carried by strains of Streptococcus durans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The strains carrying the slow-reacting PBP demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. Spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from S. faecium ATCC 9790. They all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting PBP produced. Mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of S. durans, S. faecalis, and S. faecium. All of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting PBP than that carried by the parent. Finally, it was found that resistant S. faecium ATCC 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all PBPs except PBP 5. Cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting PBP by 90%. This penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  - HPr proteins of different microorganisms studied by hydrogen-1 high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance: similarities of structures and mechanisms.
AB  - The HPr proteins of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were studied by 1H NMR at 360 MHz. The "active-center" histidines of all HPr proteins are characterized by a low pK value between 5.6 and 6.1 and similar spectral parameters. Phosphorylation of the histidyl residues leads to an increase of the pK value of 2-3 units and spectral changes characteristic for N-1 phosphorylation of the histidyl ring. The spectra of the HPr proteins of S. lactis, S. Faecalis, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus reveal many similarities, whereas the spectrum of the E. coli protein is different with exception of the active-center histidine. The HPr protein of S. lactis is formylated at its terminal amino group.
TI  - The distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups D and N.
AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of groups N and D streptococci isolated from rumen fluids.
AB  - Twelve strains of streptococci of serological groups N and D were isolated from rumen fluids of nine cows on four rations although both groups were not isolated from the same animal. The twelve were representative of a larger number of streptococci isolated by enrichment in milk. Generally, the physiological characteristics of the isolates indicated members of the lactic or enterococcus groups; however, several were atypical in one or more of the tolerance tests. Physiologically typical Streptococcus lactis but not S. cremoris, were isolated.

TI  - Selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of Streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Hot saline extracts of Streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. Chromatography of the extract of S. mutans strain MT703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 column gave two principal antigens. One antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. The other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. It was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (PGP) from group A Streptococcus pyogenes and/or S. mutans strain Ingbritt (type c). The PGP antigen was further purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-75. Two peaks, PGP-1, and PGP-2, were obtained. Each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-PGP serum as shown by immunodiffusion. Chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. PGP antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. However, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of PGP. The PGP in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity. The addition of diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting PGP antigen. After adsorption of the extract from S. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and PGP antigens were absorbed with the resin. This simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the PGP-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.
TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.

TI  - Influence of antibiotics or certain intestinal bacteria on orally administered Candida albicans in germ-free and conventional mice.
AB  - Candida albicans, administered by gastric intubation, persisted in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice for long periods but was eliminated within a relatively short period of time in pathogen-free mice. Oxytetracycline administered by mouth had no reproducible effect on the persistence of C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract of either germ-free or pathogen-free mice. Prolonged administration of streptomycin extended the time that C. albicans could be recovered from feces of pathogen-free mice when compared to mice not receiving the antibiotic or those receiving a single large dose. There was a brief interval of time during which C. albicans could not be recovered from the feces of gnotobiotic mice contaminated with certain intestinal bacteria, but eventually all mice began to shed the fungus again. C. albicans administered by mouth was not pathogenic for germ-free or pathogen-free mice. It can be concluded from these findings that mice do not possess an innate resistance to C. albicans but that pathogen-free mice do possess some ecological mechanism which prevents establishment of the fungus in their gastrointestinal tract. The reason for the difference in colonization of C. albicans in germ-free or gnotobiotic mice and pathogen-free mice was not determined.
