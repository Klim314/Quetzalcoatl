TI  - Transduction of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage Phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(A) and tet(O), to other Streptococcus species.
AB  - Phim46.1 - Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(A) and tet(O), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (M phenotype) and tetracycline - is widespread in S. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. Phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among S. pyogenes isolates, but no information is available about its transferability to other Streptococcus species. We thus investigated Phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of different Streptococcus species. Transductants were obtained from recipients of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus suis. Retransfer was always achieved, and from S. suis to S. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. In transductants Phim46.1 retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin C, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. The transductants shared the same Phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved RNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. No transfer occurred to recipients of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. A largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. Growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of Phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in S. suis. The S. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene atl.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Protective mechanisms of respiratory tract Streptococci against Streptococcus pyogenes biofilm formation and epithelial cell infection.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]) encounter many streptococcal  species of the physiological microbial biome when entering the upper respiratory tract of humans, leading to the question how GAS interact with these bacteria in order to establish themselves at this anatomic site and initiate infection. Here we show that S. oralis and S. salivarius in direct contact assays inhibit growth of GAS in a strain-specific manner and that S. salivarius, most likely via bacteriocin secretion, also exerts this effect in transwell experiments. Utilizing scanning electron microscopy documentation, we identified the tested strains as potent biofilm producers except for GAS M49. In mixed-species biofilms, S. salivarius dominated the GAS strains, while S. oralis acted as initial colonizer, building the bottom layer in mixed biofilms and thereby allowing even GAS M49 to form substantial biofilms on top. With the exception of S. oralis, artificial saliva reduced single-species biofilms and allowed GAS to dominate in mixed biofilms, although the overall two-layer structure was unchanged. When covered by S. oralis and S. salivarius biofilms, epithelial cells were protected from GAS adherence, internalization, and cytotoxic effects. Apparently, these species can have probiotic effects. The use of Affymetrix array technology to assess HEp-2 cell transcription levels revealed modest changes after exposure to S. oralis and S. salivarius biofilms which could explain some of the protective effects against GAS attack. In summary, our study revealed a protection effect of respiratory tract bacteria against an important airway pathogen and allowed a first in vitro insight into local environmental processes after GAS enter the respiratory tract.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Targeting of streptococci by zoocin A.
AB  - Zoocin A is a domain-structured peptidoglycan hydrolase produced by Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus 4881. [(14)C]-zoocin A was used to measure the amount of zoocin A bound to the surface of cells and to purified peptidoglycan. The sensitivity of various streptococci to zoocin A correlated with the amount of zoocin A bound (R(2)=0.8609). Peptidoglycan purified from Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus rattus were able to bind zoocin A but remained resistant to hydrolysis. All Streptococcus pyogenes strains were extremely sensitive to zoocin A with minimum inhibition concentrations of 31.5 ng mL(-1) or less, suggesting that zoocin A may have potential for use as an enzybiotic.
TI  - Comparison and transferability of the erm (B) genes between human and farm animal streptococci.
AB  - To obtain better insights into the possible exchange of resistance genes between  human and animal streptococci, the sequences of the erm (B) genes of streptococcal isolates from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, chickens, and calves were compared. Identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in strains from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, and calves. During in vitro mating experiments, the erm (B) gene was exchanged between porcine Streptococcus suis and human S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. oralis strains. The presence of different tetracycline resistance genes and the int Tn 1545 gene was determined in animal streptococci carrying the erm (B) gene. Although tet(M) and int Tn 1545 genes were detected in 24% of the porcine and pork carcass streptococcal strains, the tet(O) gene was the predominant tetracycline resistance gene in these strains (81%). The latter gene was co-transferred with the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis strains to human streptococci in the mating experiments. These results show that, identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in animal and human streptococci and that transfer of the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis to human streptococci and vice versa is possible, but probably occurs at a low frequency.
TI  - rpoB gene sequence-based identification of aerobic Gram-positive cocci of the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Abiotrophia, and Granulicatella.
AB  - We developed a new molecular tool based on rpoB gene (encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. We first sequenced the complete rpoB gene for Streptococcus anginosus, S. equinus, and Abiotrophia defectiva. Sequences were aligned with these of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae available in GenBank. Using an in-house analysis program (SVARAP), we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and, by using these conserved zones as PCR primer targets, we amplified and sequenced this variable region in an additional 30 Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Abiotrophia species. This region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. We therefore applied our identification system by PCR amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. Amplicons were obtained in streptococci and Bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. Molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the S. pneumoniae-S. oralis-S. mitis group and the S. agalactiae-S. difficile group. These signatures allowed us to design a S. pneumoniae-specific PCR and sequencing primer pair.
TI  - Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography detection of ribosomal mutations conferring macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Mutations in genes coding for L4 (rplD) or L22 (rplV) ribosomal proteins or in 23S rRNA (rrl gene) are reported as a cause of macrolide resistance in streptococci and staphylococci. This study was aimed at evaluating a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) technique as a rapid mutation screening method. Portions of these genes were amplified by PCR from total DNA of 48 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 16), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 6), Streptococcus oralis (n = 2), and group G streptococcus (n = 2). Thirty-seven of these strains were resistant to macrolides and harbored one or several mutations in one or two of the target genes, and 11 were susceptible. PCR products were analyzed by DHPLC. All mutations were detected, except a point mutation in a pneumococcal rplD gene. The method detected one mutated rrl copy out of six in S. aureus. This automated method is promising for screening of mutations involved in macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Quantitative detection of Moraxella catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal secretions by real-time PCR.
AB  - The recognition of Moraxella catarrhalis as an important cause of respiratory tract infections has been protracted, mainly because it is a frequent commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract and the diagnostic sensitivity of blood or pleural fluid culture is low. Given that the amount of M. catarrhalis bacteria in the upper respiratory tract may change during infection, quantification of these bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs) by real-time PCR may offer a suitable diagnostic approach. Using primers and a fluorescent probe specific for the copB outer membrane protein gene, we detected DNA from serial dilutions of M. catarrhalis cells corresponding to 1 to 10(6) cells. Importantly, there was no difference in the amplification efficiency when the same DNA was mixed with DNA from NPSs devoid of M. catarrhalis. The specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by the lack of amplification of DNAs from other Moraxella species, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, H. influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and various Neisseria species. The assay applied to NPSs from 184 patients with respiratory tract infections performed with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of up to 98% compared to the culture results. The numbers of M. catarrhalis organisms detected by real-time PCR correlated with the numbers detected by semiquantitative culture. This real-time PCR assay targeting the copB outer membrane protein gene provided a sensitive and reliable means for the rapid detection and quantification of M. catarrhalis in NPSs; may serve as a tool to study changes in the amounts of M. catarrhalis during lower respiratory tract infections or following vaccination against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or N. meningitidis; and may be applied to other clinical samples.
TI  - Nationwide German multicenter study on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in streptococcal blood isolates from neutropenic patients and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobials.
AB  - In a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. Streptococcus oralis (26.3%), S. pneumoniae (26.3%), S. agalactiae (11.5%), S. mitis (9%), and S. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. Four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. One strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (MIC, 8 mg/liter). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among S. oralis (14.6%), S. mitis (7.1%), and S. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes. Resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%. Quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; MIC(90), 1 mg/liter, MIC range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).
TI  - Mutacin production by Streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  - The production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. To find if the degree of mutacin activity of an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. In addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. A total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin typed by the stab culture technique. Mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus mutans isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did Streptococcus sobrinus isolates. Identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. The mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. Six children were negative for mutans streptococci. Transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. S. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. In conclusion, the mutacin activity of clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of clinical importance in early colonization by S. mutans.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Mode of action of a lysostaphin-like bacteriolytic agent produced by Streptococcus zooepidemicus 4881.
AB  - Electron microscopy of zoocin A-treated sensitive streptococcus cells revealed cytoplasmic disruption and ultimately complete rupture of the cell wall. Culture viability and optical density were shown to decrease rapidly and simultaneously in Streptococcus pyogenes FF22 but less quickly in the relatively more resistant Streptococcus mutans 10449. Zoocin A was shown to cleave hexaglycine in a colorimetric cell-free microtiter assay system, and it is concluded that the killing action of zoocin A, like that of lysostaphin, is most probably the result of direct cleavage of the peptidoglycan cross-links in the cell wall. The relationship between sensitivity to zoocin A and the peptidoglycan cross-linkage structure of Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Lactococcus spp., S. pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, S. mutans, and Streptococcus rattus has been evaluated.
TI  - Mutacin activity of strains isolated from children with varying levels of mutants streptococci and caries.
AB  - A total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. Of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. Serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. More than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. Mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. oralis, Strep. gordonii, Strep. salivarius and Strep. pyogenes. Isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. When evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. The findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with Candida albicans.
AB  - Thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with Candida albicans. Streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees C-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees C (or at 28 degrees C) increased their coaggregating activity with these streptococci by at least tenfold. This was a property common to four C. albicans strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and MEN) and two of which were not (MM2002 and CA2). The expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin B. The strains of S. sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved C. albicans cells. There was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. Strains of Streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with C. albicans, and the coaggregation with S. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. The coaggregation reactions of S. sanguis and S. gordonii with C. albicans were inhibited by EDTA and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition of lactose or other simple sugars. These observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of C. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.
TI  - The presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as a guideline in the management of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Thirty-eight children who had recurrent tonsillitis and who were chronic carriers of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with oral clindamycin. Surface tonsillar cultures, obtained prior to therapy and two weeks after the termination of therapy, were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. Prior to therapy, the average yield was 9.3 isolates (5.2 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after the completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.5 isolates (3.0 aerobes and 2.5 anaerobes). The GABHS were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy, and the numbers of isolates of Bacteroides spp and Staphylococcus aureus were reduced. Beta-lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 57 isolates recovered from all tonsillar surfaces. This group included all isolates of S. aureus (15) and Bacteroides fragilis (eight), 19 of 34 Bacteroides melaninogenicus isolates (56 per cent), and seven of 12 Bacteroides oralis isolates (58 per cent). Only four isolates of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains were recovered after the conclusion of therapy. Follow-up study of 33 children for eight to 16 months (average, 13 months) showed no recurrence of GABHS in 31.
TI  - Quantitative measurement of beta lactamase in tonsils of children with recurrent  tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. The  tonsils' core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Beta lactamase production was assayed in all isolates and beta lactamase activity was measured in the contents of each tonsil. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.9 isolates (4.4 anaerobes and 3.5 aerobes) per specimen. Beta lactamase production was noted in 58 isolates recovered from 39 tonsils (78%). These were all 21 isolates of S. aureus and 10 B. fragilis, 18 of 45 B. melaninogenicus (40%), 7 of 14 B. oralis (50%), and 2 of 13 H. influenzae type B (15%). Beta lactamase activity was detected in 33 of the 39 (85%) tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing bacteria, and in none of the 11 tonsils which had no beta lactamase-producing bacteria. Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of detectable beta lactamase activity in the tonsillar tissue in most of the tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing organism.
TI  - The role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of streptococcal tonsillar infection.
AB  - The failure of penicillin to eradicate group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is a growing problem. This review summarizes current data concerning the role of aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of tonsillar infection caused by GABHS. Clinical studies have demonstrated the recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and detectable levels of the enzyme beta-lactamase in cultures of core tonsillar specimens in greater than 80% of the patients. The predominant bacteria have been Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides ruminicola, and Staphylococcus aureus. These organisms have emerged in about one-third of patients after one course of penicillin therapy and can be transferred to patient's household contacts. These organisms were present in tonsillar cultures in higher numbers in children with acute tonsillitis who did not respond to penicillin therapy than in those who were cured. Protection of GABHS by beta-lactamase-producing organisms has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Several studies, including a recent double-blinded study, have demonstrated the ability of clindamycin to eradicate the streptococcal carrier state and to prevent recurrent infection in selected patients.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - The treatment of the carrier state of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  - 20 children who were chronic carriers of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with oral clindamycin. Surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. They were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. Prior to therapy, the average yield was 9 isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). GABHS, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium sp. was reduced. Beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). These included all isolates of S. aureus (8) and B. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 B. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 B. oralis (60%). Only one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of B. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. Follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of GABHS in 19 of the 20 children.
