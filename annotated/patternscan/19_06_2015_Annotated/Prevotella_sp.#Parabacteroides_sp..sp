TI  == phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from a human brain abscess sample.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic bacterial strain, 7401987t, was isolated from a human brain  abscess sample. cells were gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccoid to rod-shaped and motile by flagella in a lophotrichous arrangement. the isolate was asaccharolytic and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c15:0 (28.2%), c16:0 (18.0%), iso-c15:0 (12.3%) and iso-c17:0 3-oh (11.7%). 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons showed that the isolate was distantly related to members of  the genera bacteroides (<83.6% similarity), parabacteroides (<79.9% similarity),  tannerella (<79.8% similarity), dysgonomonas (<79.6% similarity), porphyromonas (<79.3% similarity) and prevotella (<78.9% similarity). the low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity values and physiological and biochemical characteristics differentiated strain 7401987t from all known species and indicate that our isolate represents a novel species in a new genus within the phylum bacteroidetes. the name phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of phocaeicola abscessus is 7401987t (=ccug 55929t=csur p22t=dsm  21584t).
