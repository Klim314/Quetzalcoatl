TI  == an internal thioester in a pathogen surface protein mediates covalent host binding.
AB  == to cause disease and persist in a host, pathogenic and commensal microbes must adhere to tissues. colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. to date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. here we show that the streptococcal surface protein sfbi mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a 'chemical harpoon'. this cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and sfbi binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle  in host-microbe interactions. this represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering  beneficial interactions.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == autocatalytically generated thr-gln ester bond cross-links stabilize the repetitive ig-domain shaft of a bacterial cell surface adhesin.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are decorated by a variety of proteins that are anchored to the cell wall and project from it to mediate colonization, attachment to host  cells, and pathogenesis. these proteins, and protein assemblies, such as pili, are typically long and thin yet must withstand high levels of mechanical stress and proteolytic attack. the recent discovery of intramolecular isopeptide bond cross-links, formed autocatalytically, in the pili from streptococcus pyogenes has highlighted the role that such cross-links can play in stabilizing such structures. we have investigated a putative cell-surface adhesin from clostridium perfringens comprising an n-terminal adhesin domain followed by 11 repeat domains. the crystal structure of a two-domain fragment shows that each domain has an igg-like fold and contains an unprecedented ester bond joining thr and gln side chains. ms confirms the presence of these bonds. we show that the bonds form through an autocatalytic intramolecular reaction catalyzed by an adjacent his residue in a serine protease-like mechanism. two buried acidic residues assist in the reaction. by mutagenesis, we show that loss of the ester bond reduces the thermal stability drastically and increases susceptibility to proteolysis. as in  pilin domains, the bonds are placed at a strategic position joining the first and last strands, even though the ig fold type differs. bioinformatic analysis suggests that similar domains and ester bond cross-links are widespread in gram-positive bacterial adhesins.

TI  == structural studies of streptococcus pyogenes streptolysin o provide insights into the early steps of membrane penetration.
AB  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are a large family of bacterial toxins that exhibit a dependence on the presence of membrane cholesterol in forming large pores in cell membranes. significant changes in the three-dimensional structure of these toxins are necessary to convert the soluble monomeric protein  into a membrane pore. we have determined the crystal structure of the archetypical member of the cdc family, streptolysin o (slo), a virulence factor from streptococcus pyogenes. the overall fold is similar to previously reported cdc structures, although the c-terminal domain is in a different orientation with respect to the rest of the molecule. surprisingly, a signature stretch of cdc sequence called the undecapeptide motif, a key region involved in membrane recognition, adopts a very different structure in slo to that of the well-characterized cdc perfringolysin o (pfo), although the sequences in this region are identical. an analysis reveals that, in pfo, there are complementary interactions between the motif and the rest of domain 4 that are lost in slo. molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the loss of a salt bridge in slo and  a cation-pi interaction are determining factors in the extended conformation of the motif, which in turn appears to result in a greater flexibility of the neighboring l1 loop that houses a cholesterol-sensing motif. these differences may explain the differing abilities of slo and pfo to efficiently penetrate target cell membranes in the first step of toxin insertion into the membrane.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of lff571 against clostridium difficile and 630 other intestinal strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of lff571, a novel analog of ge2270a that inhibits bacterial growth by binding with high affinity for protein synthesis elongation factor tu, fidaxomicin, and 10 other antimicrobial agents were determined against 50 strains of clostridium difficile and 630 other anaerobic and aerobic organisms of intestinal origin. lff571 possesses potent activity against c. difficile and most other gram-positive anaerobes (mic(90), </= 0.25 mug/ml), with the exception of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. the mic(90)s for aerobes, including enterococci, staphylococcus aureus (as well as methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, and other streptococci were 0.06, 0.125, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. comparatively, fidaxomicin showed variable  activity against gram-positive organisms: mic(90)s against c. difficile, clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium spp. were 0.5, </= 0.015, and 0.125  mug/ml, respectively, but >32 mug/ml against clostridium ramosum and clostridium  innocuum. mic(90) for s. pyogenes and other streptococci was 16 and >32 mug/ml, respectively. lff571 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
AB  == a chitosan dextran-based (cd) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. the microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations.  in addition, the time-kill efficacy of cd hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. cd hydrogel was found  to be effective against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000  mg/liter. dextran aldehyde (da) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the cd hydrogel with mbc ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. s. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than e. coli. candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to cd hydrogel and da. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of e. coli and s. aureus incubated with cd hydrogel and da alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. motility and chemotaxis tests showed e. coli to be inhibited when incubated with da. the antibacterial activity of cd hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of gram-positive infections.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. the activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. an overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of cdcs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. the way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (macpf) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. in this chapter i aim to provide an overview  of our understanding of the interaction between cdcs and other members of what is now called the macpf/cdc superfamily, with their target membranes. cdcs (also in  the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four gram-positive bacterial genera (clostridium, listeria, bacillus and streptococcus). well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. listeriolysin from l. monocytogenes  is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. perfringolysin from c. perfringens (fig. 1a) has become perhaps the most studied cdc4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). streptolysin from s. pyogenes is another intensely studied cdc and has been applied widely in  experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for s. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. however, cdcs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria arcanobacterium pyogenes and gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. the homology with the macpf family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic macpf/cdc fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (fig. 1a and d). without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. the glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that cdcs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. while not all macpf domains are involved in pore formation-for example, c6 and c8beta--they are all apparently involved in action  on membranes. the dramatic refolding undergone by cdcs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the macpf/cdc domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (fig. 1a-c). it is obviously the basic assumption that  where noncdc members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 even where a member of the macpf/cdc superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. however, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another macpf/cdc family member or members from the same specific system. complement acts by a combination of the c5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting c9 to form a lesion, which may be a  complete ring of c9 associated with the c5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.

TI  == noncollagenous region of the streptococcal collagen-like protein is a trimerization domain that supports refolding of adjacent homologous and heterologous collagenous domains.
AB  == proper folding of the (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence of animal collagens requires adjacent n- or c-terminal noncollagenous trimerization domains which often contain coiled-coil or beta sheet structure. collagen-like proteins have been found recently in a number of bacteria, but little is known about their folding mechanism. the scl2 collagen-like protein from streptococcus pyogenes has an n-terminal globular domain, designated v(sp), adjacent to its triple-helix domain. the v(sp) domain is required for proper refolding of the scl2 protein in  vitro. here, recombinant v(sp) domain alone is shown to form trimers with a significant alpha-helix content and to have a thermal stability of t(m) = 45 degrees c. examination of a new construct shows that the v(sp) domain facilitates efficient in vitro refolding only when it is located n-terminal to the triple-helix domain but not when c-terminal to the triple-helix domain. fusion of the v(sp) domain n-terminal to a heterologous (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence from clostridium perfringens led to correct folding and refolding of this triple-helix, which was unable to fold into a triple-helical, soluble protein on  its own. these results suggest that placement of a functional trimerization module adjacent to a heterologous gly-xaa-yaa repeating sequence can lead to proper folding in some cases but also shows specificity in the relative location  of the trimerization and triple-helix domains. this information about their modular nature can be used in the production of novel types of bacterial collagen for biomaterial applications.

TI  == [myonecrosis in users of injecting drugs (a clinical case)].
AB  == myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. clostridia (c. perfringens, c. novyi, c. septicum, c. sordellii, c. histolyticum) are dominant and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. russia has become the largest opiate market in europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. in  the russian federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results  in a rise of cases of clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. gas gangrene in hiv-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. the analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in hiv-positive patients.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide cect7121 against human gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == mortality in pennsylvania captive elk (cervus elaphus): 1998-2006.
AB  == the necropsy records of 65 elk ranging from 1 day to 13(1/2) years of age were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. the animal carcasses were submitted from 22 separate pennsylvania elk farms over an approximately 8-year period. the most common causes of mortality in animals in which the cause of death was determined were gastrointestinal parasitism (21 cases), pneumonia (7 cases), enterocolitis (5 cases), malnutrition (5 cases), and rumenitis/acidosis (5 cases). the cause of death was undetermined in 4 of the 65  elk. nematode organisms (20 cases) were the primary parasites identified in cases of mortality owing to gastrointestinal parasitism. arcanobacterium pyogenes (3 cases), escherichia coli (3 cases), and streptococcus sp. (2 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lung in the cases of pneumonia. fungal organisms, consistent with aspergillus sp. were present histologically within the pulmonary lesions in 5 cases. bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included clostridium perfringens (2 cases), e. coli (1 case), salmonella newport  (1 case) and salmonella thompson (1 case). the majority (56.3%) of the death loss in elk of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 71.4% of the gastrointestinal parasitism, 60.0% of the malnutrition, 60.0% of the enterocolitis, and 57.1% of the pneumonia cases occurring in animals within this  age range. in conclusion, gastrointestinal parasitism, pneumonia, malnutrition, enterocolitis and rumenitis/acidosis were considered the most common causes of death in captive elk in this study.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == cot mattresses as reservoirs of potentially harmful bacteria and the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == cot mattress materials were investigated as potential reservoirs of bacteria in relation to the sudden infant death syndrome (sids). the sleeping position of the infant significantly influenced bacterial population density of cot mattress polyurethane foams (p<0.0000001) and their covers (p<0.004). staphylococcus aureus was isolated at significantly higher frequency (p<0.03) from the infant's  head region of cot mattress materials. significantly higher bacterial population  densities (p<0.001) were associated with polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses (exposed polyurethane foam), when compared to those from mattresses completely covered by polyvinyl chloride (integral type mattress). the frequency  of isolation of s. aureus from polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses was also significantly higher (p=0.03) than from foams from the integral type. the following factors were significantly associated with increased frequency of isolation of s. aureus: from the polyurethane foam, previous use of non-integral  mattresses by another child (p=0.03 for all sample sites, p=0.01 for torso region); from the covers, sleeping in the prone position (p=0.003 head region, p=0.001 torso region). prone sleeping was also significantly associated with increased bacterial population levels (p=0.01) and increased frequency of isolation of escherichia coli (p=0.02) from the torso region of cot mattress covers. these findings could explain some recently identified risk factors for sids associated with type and previous use of cot mattresses. clostridium perfringens was isolated at very low frequency and streptococcus pyogenes was not isolated from any cot mattress materials tested.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == specificity of streptolysin o in cytolysin-mediated translocation.
AB  == cytolysin-mediated translocation (cmt) is a recently described process in the gram-positive pathogen streptococcus pyogenes that translocates an effector protein of streptococcal origin into the cytoplasm of a host cell. at least two proteins participate in cmt, the pore-forming molecule streptolysin o (slo) and an effector protein with the characteristics of a signal transduction protein, the streptococcus pyogenes nad-glycohydrolase (spn). in order to begin to elucidate the molecular details of the translocation process, we examined whether perfringolysin o (pfo), a pore-forming protein related to slo, could substitute for slo in the translocation of spn. when expressed by s. pyogenes, pfo, like slo, had the ability to form functional pores in keratinocyte membranes. however, unlike slo, pfo was not competent for translocation of spn across the host cell membrane. thus, pore formation by itself was not sufficient to promote cmt, suggesting that an additional feature of slo was required. this conclusion was supported by the construction of a series of mutations in slo that uncoupled pore formation and competence for cmt. these mutations defined a domain in slo that was dispensable for pore formation, but was essential for cmt. however, introduction of this domain into pfo did not render pfo competent for cmt, implying that an additional domain of slo is also critical for translocation. taken together, these data indicate that slo plays an active role in the translocation process that extends beyond that of a passive pore.

AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == the skhr motif is required for biological function of the virr response regulator from clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the response regulator virr and its cognate sensor histidine kinase, virs, are responsible for toxin gene regulation in the human pathogen clostridium perfringens. the c-terminal domain of virr (virrc) contains the functional fxrxhrs motif, which is involved in dna binding and is conserved in many regulatory proteins. virrc was cloned, purified, and shown by in vivo and in vitro studies to comprise an independent dna binding domain. random and site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify further amino acids that were required for the functional integrity of the protein. random mutagenesis identified a unique residue, met-172, that was required for biological function.  site-directed mutagenesis of the skhr motif (amino acids 216 to 219) revealed that these residues were also required for biological activity. analysis of the mutated proteins indicated that they were unable to bind to the dna target with the same efficiency as the wild-type protein.

TI  == biology and pathogenesis of thrombosis and procoagulant activity in invasive infections caused by group a streptococci and clostridium perfringens.
AB  == group a streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis/myonecrosis and clostridium perfringens gas gangrene are two of the most fulminant gram-positive infections in humans. tissue destruction associated with these infections progresses rapidly to involve an entire extremity. multiple-organ failure is common, and morbidity and mortality remain high. systemic activation of coagulation and dysregulation of the anticoagulation pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of many diverse disease entities of infectious etiology, and it has been our hypothesis that microvascular thrombosis contributes to reduced tissue perfusion, hypoxia, and subsequent regional tissue necrosis and organ failure in these invasive gram-positive infections. this article reviews the coagulation, anticoagulation,  and fibrinolytic systems from cellular players to cytokines to novel antithrombotic therapies and discusses the mechanisms contributing to occlusive microvascular thrombosis and tissue destruction in invasive group a streptococcal and c. perfringens infections. a thorough understanding of these mechanisms may suggest novel therapeutic targets for patients with these devastating infections.

TI  == the virr/virs regulatory cascade affects transcription of plasmid-encoded putative virulence genes in clostridium perfringens strain 13.
AB  == we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of the putative virulence genes encoded on the plasmid pcp13 from clostridium perfringens strain 13. the transcription of the beta2-toxin (cpb2) and possible collagen adhesin (cna) genes were regulated in both a positive and negative manner, respectively, by the two-component virr/virs system. the secondary regulator of the virr/virs system,  vr-rna, also affects the expression of both of these genes in the same fashion as the virr/virs system. this indicates that the global regulatory cascade of the virr/virs system controls the expression of virulence genes located on the plasmid, as well as those found chromosomally in c. perfringens strain 13.

TI  == the fxrxhrs motif: a conserved region essential for dna binding of the virr response regulator from clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the virsr two-component signal transduction pathway regulates virulence and toxin production in clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene. the response regulator, virr, binds to repeat sequences located upstream of the promoter and is directly responsible for the transcriptional activation of pfoa,  the structural gene for the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, perfringolysin o. comparative sequence analysis of the 236 amino acid residue virr protein revealed a two-domain structure: a typical n-terminal response regulator domain and an uncharacterised c-terminal domain. database searching revealed that over 40 other proteins, many of which appeared to be response regulators or transcriptional activators, had homology with the virr c-terminal domain (virrc). multiple sequence alignment of this virrc family revealed a highly conserved region that was designated the fxrxhrs motif. by deletion analysis this motif was shown to be essential for the functional integrity of the virr protein. alanine scanning mutagenesis and subsequent phenotypic analysis indicated that conserved residues  located within the motif were required for activity. these residues extended from l179 to n194. more detailed site-directed mutagenesis showed that amino acid residues r186, h188 and s190 were essential for activity since even conservative  substitutions in these positions resulted in non-functional proteins. three of the mutant proteins, r186k, s190a and s190c, were purified and shown by in vitro  gel shift analysis to be unable to bind to the specific target dna with the same  efficiency as the wild-type protein. these data reveal for the first time that virrc functions as a dna binding domain in which the highly conserved fxrxhrs motif has a functional role. these studies have important implications for this new family of transcriptional factors since they imply that the conserved fxrxhrs motif may be involved in dna binding in all of these proteins, irrespective of their biological role.

TI  == proteome and transcriptome analysis of the virulence genes regulated by the virr/virs system in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the proteins under the control of the two-component system virr/virs in clostridium perfringens were analyzed by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the culture supernatant from the wild type and the virr mutant. based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/mass  spectrometry, seven positively regulated proteins and eight negatively regulated  proteins were identified. transcriptome analysis confirmed that 7 of the 15 proteins were regulated by the virr/virs system at the transcriptional level, but the remaining proteins were modified with a virr/virs-directed protease at the posttranslation and secretion levels. we purified and characterized the virr/virs-directed protease from the culture supernatant and identified it as a kind of clostripain. because this proteolytic activity was strongly inhibited by  leupeptin and antipain, it was concluded that this protease was a member of the family of cysteine proteases of c. perfringens.

TI  == autonomous expression of the slo gene of the bicistronic nga-slo operon of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a recent model for cytolysin-mediated translocation in streptococcus pyogenes proposes that nad-glycohydrolase is translocated through streptolysin o-generated pores into a host cell (j. madden, n. ruiz, and m. caparon, cell 104:143-152, 2001). this model also assumes that the nad-glycohydrolase (nga) and streptolysin o (slo) genes that code for these products are organized in an operon-like structure expressed from a single promoter only (nga). we expand this model by showing that slo possesses its own autonomous promoter, which is located 155 bp upstream of the slo gene. under experimental conditions in which s. pyogenes is grown in thy medium, the strength of the slo promoter, as measured by the activity of a lacz reporter gene, resulted in low but highly reproducible values. finally, we demonstrated that slor, a s. pyogenes gene that closely resembles the clostridium perfringens pfor gene, exerts a negative effect on the expression of  the slo gene.

TI  == clostridial virr/virs regulon involves a regulatory rna molecule for expression of toxins.
AB  == we analysed the region encoding vr-rna (virr-regulated rna), which has been reported to be positively regulated by the two-component virr/virs system in clostridium perfringens. the vr-rna promoter identified by primer extension analysis was preceded by a probable virr-binding site (ccagttnnncac), which resembled a repeated sequence motif present in the promoter region of the theta-toxin (pfoa) gene. a vr-rna-null mutant, constructed by a homologous recombination, exhibited a reduced amount of transcription of the alpha- (plc) and kappa-toxin (cola) genes, which was restored by the complementation of intact vr-rna, indicating that the vr-rna region plays an important role in the regulation of the plc and cola genes in c. perfringens. it was found that the regulatory effect was observed even when the hyp7 gene encoded on vr-rna was deleted or a nonsense mutation was introduced in the hyp7-coding region. we found that the small 3'-portion of vr-rna was sufficient for the activation of toxin genes, which suggested that vr-rna itself could act as an rna regulatory molecule for the plc and cola genes mediating the regulatory information from the virr/virs system in c. perfringens.

AB  == clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening gas gangrene and mild enterotoxaemia in humans, although  it colonizes as normal intestinal flora of humans and animals. the organism is known to produce a variety of toxins and enzymes that are responsible for the severe myonecrotic lesions. here we report the complete 3,031,430-bp sequence of  c. perfringens strain 13 that comprises 2,660 protein coding regions and 10 rrna  genes, showing pronounced low overall g + c content (28.6%). the genome contains  typical anaerobic fermentation enzymes leading to gas production but no enzymes for the tricarboxylic acid cycle or respiratory chain. various saccharolytic enzymes were found, but many enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis were lacking in  the genome. twenty genes were newly identified as putative virulence factors of c. perfringens, and we found a total of five hyaluronidase genes that will also contribute to virulence. the genome analysis also proved an efficient method for  finding four members of the two-component virr/virs regulon that coordinately regulates the pathogenicity of c. perfringens. clearly, c. perfringens obtains various essential materials from the host by producing several degradative enzymes and toxins, resulting in massive destruction of the host tissues.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == identification of novel virr/virs-regulated genes in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == novel genes that are regulated in clostridium perfringens by the two-component regulatory system, virr/virs, were identified using a differential display method. a plasmid library was constructed from c. perfringens chromosomal dna, and the plasmids were hybridized with cdna probes prepared from total rna of wild-type strain 13 and its virr mutant derivative ts133. three clones were identified that carry newly identified virr/virs-regulated genes, two of which were positively regulated and one of which was negatively regulated. genes located on the identified clones were deduced by nucleotide sequencing, and the target genes of the virr/virs system were identified with a set of northern hybridizations. a 4.9 kb mrna transcribing the metb (cystathionine gamma-synthase), cysk (cysteine synthase) and ygag (hypothetical protein) genes was negatively regulated, whereas 1.6 and 6.0 kb transcripts encoding ptp (protein tyrosine phosphatase) and cpd (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase) respectively, were shown to be positively regulated by the  virr/virs system. the other gene, hyp7, whose transcript was positively regulated by the virr/virs system, was shown to activate the transcription of the cola (kappa-toxin) and plc (alpha-toxin) genes, but not the pfoa (theta-toxin) gene in c. perfringens. these results suggested that the global regulatory system virr/virs could regulate various genes, other than toxin genes, both positively and negatively and that the hyp7 gene might encode a novel regulatory factor for  toxin production in c. perfringens.

TI  == the virr response regulator from clostridium perfringens binds independently to two imperfect direct repeats located upstream of the pfoa promoter.
AB  == regulation of toxin production in the gram-positive anaerobe clostridium perfringens occurs at the level of transcription and involves a two-component signal transduction system. the sensor histidine kinase is encoded by the virs gene, while its cognate response regulator is encoded by the virr gene. we have constructed a virr expression plasmid in escherichia coli and purified the resultant his-tagged virr protein. gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that virr binds to the region upstream of the pfoa gene, which encodes perfringolysin  o, but not to regions located upstream of the virr-regulated plc, cola, and pfor  genes, which encode alpha-toxin, collagenase, and a putative pfoa regulator, respectively. the virr binding site was shown by dnase i footprinting to be a 52-bp core sequence situated immediately upstream of the pfoa promoter. when this region was deleted, virr was no longer able to bind to the pfoa promoter. the binding site was further localized to two imperfect direct repeats (cccagttntncac) by site-directed mutagenesis. binding and protection analysis of  these mutants indicated that virr had the ability to bind independently to the two repeated sequences. based on these observations it is postulated that the virr positively regulates the synthesis of perfringolysin o by binding directly to a region located immediately upstream of the pfoa promoter and activating transcription.

TI  == the virr/virs locus regulates the transcription of genes encoding extracellular toxin production in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == extracellular toxin production in clostridium perfringens is positively regulated by the two-component regulatory genes virr and virs. northern (rna) blots carried out with rna preparations from the wild-type strain 13 and the isogenic virr and  virs mutants ts133 and jir4000 showed that the virr and virs genes composed an operon and were transcribed as a single 2.1-kb mrna molecule. primer extension analysis led to the identification of two promoters upstream of virr. hybridization analysis of the mutants and their complemented derivatives showed that the virr/virs system positively regulated the production of alpha-toxin (or  phospholipase c, theta-toxin (perfringolysin o), and kappa-toxin (collagenase) at the transcriptional level. however, the modes of regulation of these genes were shown to differ. the theta-toxin structural gene, pfoa, had both a major and a very minor promoter, with the major promoter being virr/virs dependent. the cola  gene, which encodes the kappa-toxin, had two major promoters, only one of which was virr/virs-dependent. in contrast, the alpha-toxin structural gene, p1c, had only one promoter, which was shown to be partially regulated by the virr and virs genes. comparative analysis of the virr/virs-dependent promoters did not reveal any common sequence motifs that could represent virr-binding sites. it was concluded that either the virr/virs system modulates its effects via secondary regulatory genes that are specific for each toxin structural gene or the virr protein does not have a single consensus binding sequence.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == identification and characterization of a bacteroides gene, csuf, which encodes an outer membrane protein that is essential for growth on chondroitin sulfate.
AB  == bacteroides thetaiotaomicron can utilize a variety of polysaccharides, including  charged mucopolysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate (cs) and hyaluronic acid  (ha). since the enzymes (chondroitin lyases i and ii) that catalyze the first step in breakdown of cs and ha are located in the periplasm, we had proposed that the first step in utilization of these polysaccharides was binding to one or more outer membrane proteins followed by translocation into the periplasm, but no such outer membrane proteins had been shown to play a role in cs or ha utilization. previously we have isolated a transposon-generated mutant, cs4, which was unable  to grow on cs or ha but retained the ability to grow on disaccharide components of cs. this phenotype suggested that the mutation in cs4 either blocked the transport of the mucopolysaccharides into the periplasmic space or blocked the depolymerization of the mucopolysaccharides into disaccharides. we have mapped the cs4 mutation to a single gene, csuf, which is capable of encoding a protein of 1,065 amino acids and contains a consensus signal sequence. although csuf had  a predicted molecular weight and pi similar to those of chondroitin lyases, it did not show significant sequence similarity to the bacteroides chondroitin lyase ii, a proteus chondroitin abc lyase, or two hyaluronidases from clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes, nor was any cs-degrading enzyme activity  associated with csuf expression in bacteroides species or escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence of csuf exhibited features suggestive of an outer membrane protein. we obtained antibodies to csuf and demonstrated that the protein is located in the outer membrane. this is the first evidence that a nonenzymatic outer membrane protein is essential for utilization of cs and ha.

AB  == rp 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of rp 57669 and rp 54476. the activity of rp 59500 and its two components against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. rp 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal  to 1 mg/l (range 0.06-2 mg/l). both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of s. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and  ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group c and g streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the mic90 was 4 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59500 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of rp 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were bacteroides spp. rp 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. mbcs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, compared with mbcs in broth, but rp 59500  was as active at ph 6 as at ph 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. rp 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bay y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == bay y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as bacteriodes fragilis and clostridium perfringens. mic90s for s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and s. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant s. aureus, mic50 levels of bay y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. the potency of bay y3118 against all members of the enterobacteriaceae generally  was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. bay y3118 was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on mic determinations. the drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference mbcs and time-kill curves. from the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. for comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. when tested against a higher inoculum or using the  broth dilution technique, the activity of bay v 3522 showed little dependence on  inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. clinical studies are thus warranted.

TI  == a54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  == a54145 complex is made up of eight factors; a, a1, b, b1, c, d, e, and f which were active in vitro (mic 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive aerobic organisms. the complex, factor b and b1 were found  to be active against two strains of clostridium perfringens. a calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. resistance build-up was seen when staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of a54145 antibiotics. this resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. factor a was very effective against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ed50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). factor b was more active against s. pyogenes in vivo (sc ed50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  == lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small  cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of trypan blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. the membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded trypan blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. furthermore, the use of trypan blue uptake as a measure of cell  death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

AB  == the membrane-damaging properties on human diploid embryonic lung fibroblasts of streptolysin o (from streptococcus pyogenes) and theta-toxin (from clostridium perfringens) were compared. the results are consistent with the suggested mechanism for hemolysis by streptolysin o involving one fixation site and one lytic site of this cytolysin. however, the membrane-damaging activity of the two  toxins differed with respect to (i) relative cytolytic activity on human diploid  lung fibroblasts compared with that on sheep erythrocytes, (ii) binding to the fibroblast membrane, (iii) activity at 0 degrees c, (iv) membrane repair after more than 30 min, and (v) effect on influx of amino acids. it is concluded that the mechanism of membrane damage caused by theta-toxin differs from that of cytoplasmic membrane. these results question the current concept that all thiol-activated, cholesterol-inactivated bacterial toxins are similar both structurally and functionally.

AB  == an alpha-toxin disk test is described in which group b streptococci completed the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes partially lysed by the alpha-toxin of clostridium perfringens. the test was performed satisfactorily on the sheep blood agar primary isolation plate, as well as on pure cultures. a total of 95% of strains of pure group b streptococci tested produced positive reactions within 5 h, and all were positive after overnight incubation, with patterns of synergistic hemolysis readily distinguishable from those seen with group a streptococci. the  preparation of disks is well within the scope of most clinical laboratories.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == synthesis and biological activity of new 2-nitroimidazole derivatives.
AB  == in an earlier paper we described the synthesis and the antitrichomonas activity of 2-nitro-alpha,alpha,1-trimethyl-1h-imidazole-5-methanol (2). starting from this compound, several derivatives have been synthesized. among these, the phenyl carbonate 8 has been shown to possess activity equal to that of 2 and to be less  toxic. this compound therefore is interesting in comparison with some antitrichomonas agents currently in use clinically. before undertaking an in-depth investigation, compound 8 was subjected to some studies to see whether it has any effects on the central nervous system (cns). preliminary results show  that, at therapeutic doses, it might induce unwanted cns effects to a lesser degree than metronidazole.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  == it has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. this was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. in similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.

TI  == sensitive assay for detection of toxin-induced damage to the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts.
AB  == a sensitive assay was developed for detection and quantitation of subtle permeability changes in the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts. release of the non-metabolizable amino acid [1-14c]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (aib; molecular weight (103) from the cytoplasm of prelabeled cells was used as an indicator of toxin-induced membrane damage. an optimal procedure for labeling  these cells was designed after varying the conditions with regard to ph, temperature, concentration of aib, composition of medium, and incubation time. toxin-induced release of aib was compared with release of a previously described  nucleotide label, [3h]uridine. melittin from bee venom and the polyene antibiotics filipin and amphotericin b in low concentrations induced a strikingly greater release of aib than of nucleotide label. the sensitivity of this assay was furthermore demonstrated by treatment with the following bacterial cytolysins: phospholipase c and theta-toxin from clostridium perfringens, alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-toxins from staphylococcus aureus, and streptolysin s from streptococcus pyogenes. in spite of their different modes of action, all these membrane-active toxins at low concentrations induced a significant release  of aib label. for an equal release of nucleotide label, several times higher concentrations were required.

TI  == antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids.
AB  == smith, rodney f. (university of maryland, baltimore), donald e. shay, and norman  j. doorenbos. antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids. j. bacteriol. 85:1295-1299. 1963.-a new group of 16 synthetic nitrogen-containing steroids have been tested against a variety of microorganisms for antimicrobial properties. the gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were  used in the studies. the organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and  molds. the gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. all 16 steroids interfered  to some extent with pigmentation in serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in pseudomonas aeruginosa. in a few instances, some of the molds were  stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.
