oral administration of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, a butyrate-producing bacterium, decreases the formation of aberrant crypt foci in the colon and rectum of mice.
butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, a butyrate-producing ruminal bacterium, was evaluated  for use as a probiotic to prevent colorectal cancer. oral administration to jcl:icr mice of a new strain of b. fibrisolvens (mdt-1) that produces butyrate at a high rate (10(9) cfu/dose) increased the rate of butyrate production by fecal microbes, suggesting that mdt-1 can grow in the gut. the number of colorectal aberrant crypt foci (acf), putative preneoplastic lesions induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, was reduced after mdt-1 administration (10(9) cfu/dose, 3 times/wk for 4 wk). the number of aberrant crypts (acs), number of foci having 3 or 4 acs per focus, and the percentage of mice having 3 or 4 acs per focus were also reduced, suggesting that the progress of lesions was suppressed by mdt-1. interestingly, the mdt-1 cell homogenate did not have a similar beneficial effect. mdt-1 had low beta-glucuronidase activity, and administration of mdt-1 reduced the beta-glucuronidase activity in the colorectal contents. the numbers of natural killer (nk) and nkt cells in the spleen were markedly enhanced in response to mdt-1. decreased beta-glucuronidase activity and increased numbers of nk and nkt cells and butyrate production may explain in part why mdt-1 administration suppressed acf formation. these results suggest that colorectal cancer may be prevented or suppressed by the utilization of mdt-1 as a probiotic. administration of mdt-1 had no harmful effect on the health of mice at least for 3 mo.
