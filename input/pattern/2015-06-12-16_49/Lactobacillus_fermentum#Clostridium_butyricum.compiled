TI  - Ability of Lactobacillus fermentum to overcome host alpha-galactosidase deficiency, as evidenced by reduction of hydrogen excretion in rats consuming soya alpha-galacto-oligosaccharides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soya and its derivatives represent nutritionally high quality food products whose major drawback is their high content of alpha-galacto-oligosaccharides. These are not digested in the small intestine due to the natural absence of tissular alpha-galactosidase in mammals. The passage of these carbohydrates to the large intestine makes them available for fermentation by gas-producing bacteria leading to intestinal flatulence. The aim of the work reported here was to assess the ability of alpha-galactosidase-producing lactobacilli to improve the digestibility of alpha-galacto-oligosaccharides in situ. RESULTS: Gnotobiotic rats were orally fed with soy milk and placed in respiratory chambers designed to monitor fermentative gas excretion. The validity of the animal model was first checked using gnotobiotic rats monoassociated with a Clostridium butyricum hydrogen (H2)-producing strain. Ingestion of native soy milk by these rats caused significant H2 emission while ingestion of alpha-galacto-oligosaccharide-free soy milk did not, thus validating the experimental system. When native soy milk was fermented using the alpha-galactosidase-producing Lactobacillus fermentum CRL722 strain, the resulting product failed to induce H2 emission in rats thus validating the bacterial model. When L. fermentum CRL722 was coadministered with native soy milk, a significant reduction (50 %, P = 0.019) in H2 emission was observed, showing that alpha-galactosidase from L. fermentum CRL722 remained active in situ, in the gastrointestinal tract of rats monoassociated with C. butyricum. In human-microbiota associated rats, L. fermentum CRL722 also induced a significant reduction of H2 emission (70 %, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that L. fermentum alpha-galactosidase is able to partially alleviate alpha-galactosidase deficiency in rats. This offers interesting perspectives in various applications in which lactic acid bacteria could be used as a vector for delivery of digestive enzymes in man and animals.
