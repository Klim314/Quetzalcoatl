TI  == isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in dammam  in eastern saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: this study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of dammam, in the eastern region of saudi arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. materials and methods: the analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. results: there were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria sicca, micrococcus luteus, proteus mirabilis, bacillus subtilis, and enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. there were fungal isolates as follows: alternaria alternata, aspergillus niger, cladosporium sp., penicillium spp., aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, rhizopus stolonifer, aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. conclusions: the study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to  the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. this means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.

TI  == the activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  == p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and std activity. mic determinations  were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on haemophilus ducreyi, neisseria gonorrheae, candida albicans, bacillus subtilus, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and psuedomanas aeruginosa. an in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microm (17,9 microg/ml) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living  cells.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == bacteriology, drug stability and exchange of percutaneous delivery systems and antibacterial filters in long-term intrathecal infusion of opioid drugs and bupivacaine in "refractory" pain.
AB  == objective: to provide a basis for recommendations on the exchange of containers (syringes and cassettes) and antibacterial filters, and for choice of administration device in patients with "refractory" pain treated with long-term percutaneous intrathecal (it) infusions of opioid (morphine or buprenorphine) and bupivacaine mixtures. design: prospective, cohort, nonrandomized control trial-case series, with consecutive sample, no standard criterion, and cost-benefit analysis. setting: tertiary care center, institutional practice as well as hospitalized and ambulatory care. patients: eighty-nine (51 women and 38  men); 81 with malignant pain and 8 with benign "refractory" pain. interventions:  (a) the chemical stability of the drugs in the containers during 30 days. (b) the results of bacteriologic culture of the residual volumes of the analgesic mixtures from used and reused (1-16 times) syringes (n = 135) and cassettes (n =  258), and of 5 ml of sterile isotonic saline filtered through the used millipore  filters (n = 149). the bacteriologic samples from the 89 patients were taken after 1-40 (median = 7), 1-86 (median = 20), and 5-78 (median = 31) days of it treatment, respectively. main outcome measures: chemical stability: buprenorphine and bupivacaine concentrations-liquid chromatography; morphine concentrations--gas chromatography. bacteriologic cultures: standard laboratory procedures. the hypothesis (repeated use of the infusion systems and their exchange once a month does not significantly affect drug concentrations or increase the infection risk) was elaborated before data collection began. results: the bupivacaine-opioid mixtures were found to be chemically stable within 3-10% of the original doses up to 30 days. seventeen cultures (from five syringes, six cassettes, and six filters) in 13 patients (having no signs of meningeal infection) were found to be colonized with staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 7), viridans streptococci (n = 3), neisseria sp (n = 4), corynebacterium sp (n = 4), enterobacter sp (n = 2), klebsiella sp (n = 3), gram-negative bacilli (n = 1), and yeasts (n = 2). the place of it treatment, its duration, and patient-related infection risk factors (age; malignancy; diabetes; presence of a colostomy, pyelostomy, or indwelling urinary catheter; and the presence and location of infection foci) were not related to the results of the cultures. however, 9 of the 17 positive cultures came from patients with skin ulcers, a notable incidence. the positive cultures had no connection with the cultured item, its in-use duration, the number of times of reuse, the analgesic drugs used, their concentrations or the presence of preservatives (sodium metabisulfite and sodium edetate), or the antiseptic agent  (70% ethanol or 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate) used during bacteriologic sampling. the bacterial growth was sparse in 14 and massive in 3 of the 17 positive cultures. one item (filter) from one patient with meningitis was sterile. conclusions: in our population, exchange of the infusion systems when they are empty (within 1 month) and of the antibacterial filters once a month does not appear to affect the concentrations of, or increase the infection risk from, the  opioid-bupivacaine mixtures. the risk of bacterial contamination/colonization of  the syringes from syringe drivers does not seem to be higher than that of cassettes from external portable pumps.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  == we made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (cmz) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with  the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. determination of bacteriological efficacy while 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. isolates obtained  were: 5 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 2  strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of neisseria sp., pseudomonas maltophilia, enterobacter sp., alpha-streptococcus, beta-streptococcus and gram-positive cocci. causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the  15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. e. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. as for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. while  an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of cmz administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 15-8074 and ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  == the activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, ro 15-8074 and ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. both were highly active (mic for 90% of the strains tested [mic 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin  and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. there was no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against morganella morganii (in the case of ro 15-8074), enterobacter sp., and citrobacter sp. staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to ro 19-5247 (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), but ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. the protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for ro 19-5247. the major target  site for the two cephalosporins was pbp 3.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == [multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: cm 40874].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cm were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. cm demonstrated high activity on enterobacteriaceae, the mic being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. mode mic varies little among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of serratia sp. (mode mic : 0.25) and klebsiella oxytoca (mode mic : 0.03). most of  enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by cm at the same concentrations than susceptible strains.  cm has less activity on p. aeruginosa (mic 2-32 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter  sp. (mic 8-128). staphylococci (mic 32) and enterococci are not susceptible. variable activity is found against other streptococci. cm inhibits haemophilus sp. at mics of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and gonococci at mics of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). meningococci have a mode mic of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). thus, cm 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on haemophilus sp.  and neisseria sp. this additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella  sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml.  haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory  concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
