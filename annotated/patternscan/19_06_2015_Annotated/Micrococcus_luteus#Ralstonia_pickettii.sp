TI  == bacterial contamination of water in dental unit reservoirs.
AB  == the aim of this study was bacteriological assessment of water in dental unit reservoirs--concentration and composition of the aerobe and facultative anaerobe  bacterial microflora. reservoir water samples were taken from 25 units. bacterial flora were determined with the plate culture method. bacteria were identified with biochemical microtests: api 20e, api 20ne (biomerieux, france) and gp2 microplatetm (biolog, usa). the concentration of total bacteria isolated from one site was 201,039 cfu/ml, on average; the minimum was 22,300 cfu/ml, and the maximum - 583,000 cfu/ml. the following bacteria were identified: gram-negative bacteria--brevundimonas vesicularis, moraxella lacunata, moraxella spp., ralstonia pickettii, sphingomonas paucimobilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia; gram-positive cocci--micrococcus luteus, micrococcus lylae, staphylococcus cohnii, staphylococcus hominis ss novobiosepticus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp.; actinomycetes--streptomyces albus. the prevailing bacteria were: ralstonia pickettii (96.46%), found in all the units. sphingomonas paucimobilis (1.32%) and brevundimonas vesicularis (1.07%) were the next most frequently occurring bacteria. bacteria concentration in dental unit reservoirs reached excessive values, and the bacterial flora were composed of the bacteria characteristic for water supply systems, opportunistic pathogens, and bacteria of the oral cavity flora. continuous microbiological monitoring of the duwl water, including application of a disinfecting procedure, is necessary.

TI  == bacterial decontamination of duwl biofilm using oxygenal 6.
AB  == the aim of this study was bacteriological assessment of the dental unit waterlines (duwl) biofilm - concentration and composition of the aerobe and facultative anaerobe bacterial microflora, and evaluation of the influence of a disinfecting product, oxygenal 6, on the biofilm composition. tubing fragments were taken from 25 units twice, before and after disinfection, and bacterial suspension of the biofilm was obtained from the samples. the bacterial flora was  determined with the plate culture method. bacteria were identified with biochemical microtests: api 20e, api 20ne (biomerieux, france) and gp2 microplate(tm) (biolog, usa). before disinfection, the following bacteria were identified: gram-negative bacteria - ralstonia pickettii, pseudomonas vesicularis, sphingomonas paucimobilis, xanthomonas maltophilia; gram-positive cocci - micrococcus luteus, micrococcus lylae, staphylococcus cohnii, staphylococcus lentus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp.; actinomycetes - streptomyces albus. the prevailing bacteria were: ralstonia pickettii (78.62%), found in all the units, and sphingomonas paucimobilis (20.45%). after duwl disinfection, sphingomonas paucimobilis (88.79%) dominated in the biofilm, staphylococcus spp. - 5.61% and pseudomonas spp. - 3.74% were next most frequently occurring bacteria, and in more than a half of the biofilm samples 100% reduction of the bacterial microflora occurred. this study confirms effectiveness of oxygenal 6 in bacterial decontamination of the duwl biofilm.

TI  == symbiotic association in chlorella culture.
AB  == chlorella sorokiniana iam c-212 has long been maintained in slant culture as a mixed strain, representing an associated natural microbial consortium. in this study, the consortium was separated and five nonalgal constituents, a fungal strain (cssf-1), and four bacterial strains (cssb-1, cssb-2, cssb-3, and cssb-4)  were isolated and identified. 16s rdna sequence analysis revealed that strains cssb-1, cssb-2, cssb-3, and cssb-4 were close to ralstonia pickettii (99.8% identity), sphingomonas sp. dd38 (99.4% identity), microbacterium trichotecenolyticum (98.6% identity), and micrococcus luteus (98.6% identity) respectively. 18s rdna sequence analysis revealed that strain cssf-1 resembled acremonium-like hyphomycete kr21-2 (98.8%). the fungal strain cssf-1 and one of the bacterial strains, cssb-3, were found to promote the growth of chlorella while the presence of bacterial strains cssb-1 and cssb-2 had no effect. strain cssb-4 could not be subcultured so its role was not elucidated. these results show that the interaction between chlorella and its symbionts under photoautotrophic conditions involved both mutualism and commensalisms. the chlorophyll content of mixed strain was stable in long-term cultivation (7 months) while the chlorophyll content of a pure culture showed a marked decline.  electron microscopic analysis showed the two bacterial strains cssb-2 and cssb-3  were harbored on the sheath excreted by chlorella, while the fungal strain cssf-1 and the bacterial strain cssb-1 directly adhered to the chlorella cell surface. this report is the first observation of a symbiotic relationship among fungus, bacteria, and chlorella, and the first observation of direct adhesion of fungus and bacteria to chlorella in a consortium.
