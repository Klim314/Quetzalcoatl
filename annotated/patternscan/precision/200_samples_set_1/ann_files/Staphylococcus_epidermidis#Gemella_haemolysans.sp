TI  == a multicentre prospective study of post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  == purpose: study the clinical and microbiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of post-traumatic endophthalmitis. methods: seventeen eyes were included between 2004 and 2010, with clinical and microbiological data collected prospectively. conventional cultures and panbacterial pcr were performed on aqueous and vitreous samples. results: clinical signs of endophthalmitis were observed soon after trauma (1.5 +/- 2.5 days). laceration with an intraocular foreign body (iofb) was noted in 53% of the patients. at admission, all patients had aqueous humour (71%) and/or vitreous (53%) samples. fifteen patients (88%) underwent a pars plana vitrectomy. bacteria were identified in 77% of the cases: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 4), bacillus (n = 2), pseudomonas stuzeri (n = 1), and streptococcus salivarius and gemella haemolysans (multibacterial infection, n = 1). progression toward phthisis was observed in 35% of the cases; 41% of the patients recuperated visual acuity (va) >/=20/40. a good final visual prognosis (>/=20/40) was significantly associated with initial va better than light perception (0% versus  70%, p = 0.01) and absence of pupillary fibrin membrane (80% versus 20%, p = 0.05). there was no correlation between visual prognosis and age, the type of laceration (corneal or scleral) or presence of an iofb. we found a statistical trend toward an association between bacterial virulence and poor final va. conclusion: this series showed that better final va outcomes were associated with initial va better than light perception, s. epidermidis or culture-negative cases and absence of retinal detachment during the clinical course.
