TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
