TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin family members are differentially affected by alterations in host glycans and membrane cholesterol.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by  a diverse group of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Based on their ability to induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, CDTs are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. Despite the widespread distribution of CDTs among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. Here we demonstrate that CDTs from Haemophilus ducreyi, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in CDT binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. The absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four CDTs tested. Surprisingly, fucosylated N-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in CDT-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the CDTs tested. Finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in CDT binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of CDTs tested. The findings presented here provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of CDT-host interactions.
TI  - The contribution of cytolethal distending toxin to bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial toxin that initiates a eukaryotic cell cycle block at the G2 stage prior to mitosis. CDT is produced by a number of bacterial pathogens including: Campylobacter species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Shigella dystenteriae, enterohepatic Helicobacter species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (the cause of aggressive periodontitis), and Haemophilus ducreyi (the cause of chancroid). The functional toxin is composed of three proteins; CdtB potentiates a cascade leading to cell cycle block, and CdtA and CdtC function as dimeric subunits, which bind CdtB and delivers it to the mammalian cell interior. Once inside the cell, CdtB enters the nucleus and exhibits a DNase I-like activity that results in DNA double-strand breaks. The eukaryotic cell responds to the DNA double-strand breaks by initiating a regulatory cascade that results in cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and cell death. Mutations in CdtABC that cause any of the three subunits to lose function prevent the bacterial cell from inducing cytotoxicity. The result of CDT activity can differ somewhat depending on the eukaryotic cell types affected. Epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes undergo G2 cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and death; fibroblasts undergo G1 and G2 arrest, cellular distension, and death; and immune cells undergo G2 arrest followed by apoptosis. CDT contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting both cellular and humoral immunity via apoptosis of immune response cells, and by generating necrosis of epithelial-type cells and fibroblasts involved in the repair of lesions produced by pathogens resulting in slow healing and production of disease symptoms. Thus, CDT may function as a virulence factor in pathogens that produce the toxin.
TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin generates cell death by inducing a bottleneck in the  cell cycle.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial protein that is widely distributed among gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., enterohepatic Helicobacter spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus ducreyi. In vitro studies demonstrated that it is able to stop proliferation of various cell lines. The toxin is composed of three subunits designated CDTs A, B and C. The B subunit targets the eukaryotic DNA and triggers a signalling pathway involving different protein kinases which results in a cell block before entering into mitosis. To date, the individual role of the A and C subunits has not been totally elucidated. There are indications that the CDT is also produced in vivo. Its exact role in pathogenesis is not yet clear, but possible actions include inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis of immune cells and inhibition of a fibrotic response.
TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin: a bacterial bullet targeted to nucleus.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) is a newly added member of bacterial protein toxins that hijack the control system of eukaryotic cells. Cdts are produced by several pathogenic bacteria causing chronic infectious diseases. They are composed of three subunits, CdtA, CdtB and CdtC, which together form a ternary complex. CdtB is the active component, and CdtA and CdtC are involved in delivering the CdtB into the cells. The sophisticated strategy of Cdt to control host cells is CdtB-mediated limited DNA damage of the host cell chromosome, which triggers the response of the cell cycle checkpoint and results in G2 arrest in the cells. Cdt also induces apoptotic cell death of lymphocytes, which may be relevant to onset or persistence of chronic infection by the producing bacteria. The study of this toxin is expected to provide us information on a novel strategy by which bacteria interact with host cells.
TI  - Expression of the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) operon in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: evidence that the CdtB protein is responsible for G2 arrest of the cell cycle in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor that is encoded by the cdtB gene, which is homologous to a family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt) expressed by several gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we report that the cdt locus in A. actinomycetemcomitans is composed of five open reading frames, designated orf1, orf2, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five open reading frames are highly conserved among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains 652, Y4, 29522, and HK1651. There is also strong homology with the Cdt proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi (87-91%), but only partial homology with that of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (29-48%). Analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans mRNA by RT-PCR suggests that the two small open reading frames upstream of cdtA are coexpressed with cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. We next utilized a series of plasmids that express various combinations of the cdt genes to determine their requirement for expression of immunoinhibitory activity. Cell extracts of E. coli transformed with each of the plasmids were tested for their capacity to induce G2 arrest in the cell cycle of PHA-activated human T cells. These experiments suggest that expression of cdtB alone is sufficient to induce G2 arrest in human T cells, but do not exclude the possibility that cdtC also contributes to cell cycle arrest. The implications of our results with respect to the function of the individual Cdt proteins are discussed.
TI  - Identification of cdtB homologues and cytolethal distending toxin activity in enterohepatic Helicobacter spp.
AB  - A bacterial toxin that causes progressive distension and death of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and HeLa cells, termed cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt), has been identified in several diarrhoeagenic bacteria, including Campylobacter spp. (C. jejuni and Cq coli), some pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. Genes encoding this toxin were identified as a cluster of three adjacent genes cdtA, cdtB and cdtC. Homologues of cdtB from five species of enterohepatic helicobacters (Helicobacter hepaticus, H. bilis, H. canis and two novel Helicobacter spp. isolated from mice and woodchuck, respectively) were identified by means of degenerative PCR primers, cloned and sequenced. The similarities of these partial cdtB nucleotide sequences from these Helicobacter spp. to those of cdtB genes known to be present in other bacteria were: C. jejuni, 58.3-64.8%; E. coli, 52.3-57.8%, Haemophilus ducreyi, 53.4-58.4% and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 52.7-58.1%. Bacterial lysates from four of these helicobacters caused characteristic cytolethal distension of HeLa cells. Cdt caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase as measured by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated the presence of a toxin in these Helicobacter spp. belonging to the family of Cdt.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans immunosuppressive protein is a member of the family of cytolethal distending toxins capable of causing a G2 arrest in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor (ISF) capable of impairing human lymphocyte function by perturbing cell cycle progression. We now report that ISF is the product of the cdtB gene, one of three genes encoding the family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt). The ISF polypeptide exhibits >/=95% identity with Hemophilus ducreyi CdtB protein and </=60% homology with Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni CdtB. Pretreatment of PHA-activated lymphocytes with 5-25 ng ISF results in G2 arrest of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Similarly, treatment of HeLa cells results in G2 arrest and cell elongation and distension. However, lymphocytes are at least 5 times more sensitive to ISF than HeLa cells and do not undergo the elongation and distension that characterizes interactions of Cdts with cell lines. ISF-treated lymphocytes express normal cyclin A and B1 levels, but contain reduced levels of cell cycle-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1). Additionally, the majority of Cdk1 is in the hyperphosphorylated, inactive, form. In contrast, PHA-induced G2 cells contain elevated levels of the hypophosphorylated, active Cdk1. Failure of ISF-treated cells to dephosphorylate Cdk1 is not associated with decreased availability of Cdc25. These studies suggest that the CdtB protein alone is capable of inducing G2 arrest in lymphocytes and cell cycle arrest, elongation, and distension of HeLa cells. Our studies also suggest that lymphocytes may be primary targets for A. actinomycetemcomitans CdtB (ISF) and possibly for other Cdt family members as well. Thus, Cdts may function to impair host immunity and contribute to the pathogenesis of disease associated with Cdt-producing organisms.
