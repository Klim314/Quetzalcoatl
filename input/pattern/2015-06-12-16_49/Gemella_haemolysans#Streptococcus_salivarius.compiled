TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - Comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. We investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). By using culture-independent 16S rRNA approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. RESULTS: DGGE fingerprints showed variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. The clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and uncultivated TM7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. In combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. Bacterial species, Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorum, Johnsonella ignava and Streptococcus parasanguinis I were highly associated with tumor site where as Granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. Streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. CONCLUSIONS: The underlying changes in the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of OSCC subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. These most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be associated with OSCC and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.
TI  - A multicentre prospective study of post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Study the clinical and microbiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of post-traumatic endophthalmitis. METHODS: Seventeen eyes were included between 2004 and 2010, with clinical and microbiological data collected prospectively. Conventional cultures and panbacterial PCR were performed on aqueous and vitreous samples. RESULTS: Clinical signs of endophthalmitis were observed soon after trauma (1.5 +/- 2.5 days). Laceration with an intraocular foreign body (IOFB) was noted in 53% of the patients. At admission, all patients had aqueous humour (71%) and/or vitreous (53%) samples. Fifteen patients (88%) underwent a pars plana vitrectomy. Bacteria were identified in 77% of the cases: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), Streptococcus (n = 4), Bacillus (n = 2), Pseudomonas stuzeri (n = 1), and Streptococcus salivarius and Gemella haemolysans (multibacterial infection, n = 1). Progression toward phthisis was observed in 35% of the cases; 41% of the patients recuperated visual acuity (VA) >/=20/40. A good final visual prognosis (>/=20/40) was significantly associated with initial VA better than light perception (0% versus 70%, p = 0.01) and absence of pupillary fibrin membrane (80% versus 20%, p = 0.05). There was no correlation between visual prognosis and age, the type of laceration (corneal or scleral) or presence of an IOFB. We found a statistical trend toward an association between bacterial virulence and poor final VA. CONCLUSION: This series showed that better final VA outcomes were associated with initial VA better than light perception, S. epidermidis or culture-negative cases and absence of retinal detachment during the clinical course.
TI  - In vivo binding of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP (identical to GCDFP-15) to oral and non-oral bacteria detection and identification of EP-GP binding species.
AB  - Extra Parotid Glycoprotein (EP-GP) is a glycoprotein isolated from human saliva,  having homologues in several other body fluids. The biological role of EP-GP and its homologues is unknown. Recently, EP-GP was shown to bind in vitro to the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB. In contrast, no binding to a number of other oral microorganisms could be demonstrated. In the present study we have determined whether binding of EP-GP to bacteria occurs in vivo in saliva and in other EP-GP containing body fluids. Therefore the presence of EP-GP on bacteria in vivo was determined by analyzing oral, skin and ear floras by confocal fluoresence microscopy using specific antibodies. About 12% of the in vivo oral flora had EP-GP present on their surface, while approximately 5% of the bacteria from ear canal or skin was positive for EP-GP. IgA was detected on approximately 65% of the salivary bacteria, whereas the high-molecular weight mucin (MG1) and cystatin C were not detectable on any oral bacterium. Using a replica-plate assay, a number of EP-GP binding strains in saliva were isolated and identified as Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorium, Streptococcus acidominimus, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus parasanguis. Bacteria from the ear canal and skin bacteria were identified as Staphylococcus hominis. It is concluded that EP-GP is selectively bound in vivo to several oral and non-oral bacterial species.
TI  - Gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) CFU/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) CFU/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) CFU/ml for 75% of the samples. The 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), E. faecium (16), E. avium (7), E. durans (4), Aerococcus viridans (10), Streptococcus morbillorum (2), S. salivarius (1), S. sanguis (1), S. "milleri" (1), S. pneumoniae (1), S. acidominimus (1), and Gemella haemolysans (1). These species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. Their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). A count of the Gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.
